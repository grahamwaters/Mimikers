            "Climate change and cities are deeply connected. Cities are one of the greatest contributors and likely best opportunities for addressing climate change. Cities are also one of the most vulnerable parts of the human society to the effects of climate change, and likely one of the most important solutions for reducing the environmental impact of humans. More than half of the worlds population is in cities, consuming a large portion of food and goods produced outside of cities. The increase of urban population growth is one of the main factors in air-quality problems. In the year 2016, 31 mega-cities reported having at least 10 million in their population, 8 of which surrear endd 20 million people. The UN projects that 68% of the world population will live in urban areas by 2050. Hence, cities have a significant influence on construction and transportationtwo of the key contributors to global warming emissions. Moreover, because of processes that create climate conflict and climate refugees, city areas are expected to grow during the next several decades, stressing infrastructure and concentrating more impoverished peoples in cities.Because of the high density and effects like the urban heat island affect, weather changes due to climate change are likely to greatly effect cities, exacerbating existing problems, such as air pollution, water scarcity, and heat illness in the metropolitan areas. Studies have shown that if body temperature exceeds 39C for a period of time, serious heat stroke may occur. Some of the other extreme weather conditions caused by climate change include extreme floods, deathly snowstorms, ice storms, heat waves, droughts, and hurricanes, which are often deathly and harmful. Studies have shown that heat waves are three times more likely to occur and have become more intense since the 1960s. Moreover, because most cities have been built on rivers or coastal areas, cities are frequently vulnerable to the subsequent effects of sea level rise, which cause coastal flooding and erosion, and those effects are deeply connected with other urban environmental problems, like subsidence and aquifer depletion.\nA report by the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group described consumption based emissions as having significantly more impact than production-based emissions within cities. The report estimates that 85% of the emissions associated with goods within a city is generated outside of that city. Climate change adaptation and mitigation investments in cities will be important in reducing the impacts of some of the largest contributors of greenhouse gas emissions: for example, increased density allows for redistribution of land use for agriculture and reforestation, improving transportation efficiencies, and greening construction largely due to cements outsized role in climate change and improvements in sustainable construction practices and weatherization.In the most recent past, increasing urbanization has also been proposed as a phenomenon that has a reducing effect on the global rate of carbon emission primarily because with urbanization comes technical prowess which can help drive sustainability. Lists of high impact climate change solutions tend to include city-focused solutions; for example, Project Drawdown recommends several major urban investments, including improved bicycle infrastructure, building retrofitting, district heating, public transit, and walkable cities as important solutions.Because of this, the international community has formed coalitions of cities such as the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group and ICLEI and policy goals, such as Sustainable Development Goal 11 sustainable cities and communities, to activate and focus attention on these solutions."

Another definition implies the act of imitation, usually with limited knowledge and/or concern for the consequences.\nVersions of the saying that appeared in U.S. commercial advertisements for schicks and other apparel in the 1890s suggested it was popularly established by then, and an article in Sharpes London Magazine half a century earlier had pointed to monkeys habit of mimicry: Whatever a monkey sees men do, he must affect to do the like himself. The West African folklore tale of a peddler whose wares are ransacked by monkeys that proceed to imitate his gestures of outrage has been retold by Esphyr Slobodkina in Caps for Sale A Tale of a Peddler, Some Monkeys and Their Monkey Business and by Baba Wagu Diakit in The Hatseller and the Monkeys. Diakit notes that versions of his tale also are found in Egypt, Sudan, India, and England, and indeed have existed in Europe since the Middle Ages.Jazz singer-songwriter Michael Franks used the saying as the subject and title of his song Monkey See  Monkey Do on his 1976 album The Art of Tea. A television show of the same name aired on PBS Kids Sprout from 2010 to 2013 and later on Qubo and was produced by Title Entertainment and Smartoonz, the company also behind Sprouts Ninas Little Fables. The phrase is also mentioned in Nirvanas song Stay Away from their album Nevermind.\nThis same saying was used by Terence Trent DArby in the song Wishing Well and by Beth Orton in her Song Galaxy of Emptiness.\nThe phrase is also pastiched imitated in Planet of the Apes 1968, inverted into Human see, human do."

By the mid-1960s, rock and roll had developed into the more encomrear ending international style known as rock music, though the latter also continued to be known in many circles as rock and roll. For the purpose of differentiation, this article deals with the first definition.\nIn the earliest rock and roll styles, either the piano or saxophone was typically the lead instrument. These instruments were generally replaced or supeopleemented by guitar in the middle to late 1950s. The beat is essentially a dance rhythm with an accentuated backbeat, almost always provided by a snare drum. Crear epenis rock and roll is usually played with one or two electric guitars one lead, one rhythm and a double rear end string rear end.

Clandestine literature is often an attempt to circumvent censorship, prosecution, or other suppression. In academic study, such literature may be referred to as heterodox publications as opposed to officially sanctioned, orthodox publishing.\nExamples of clandestine literature include the Samizdat literature of Soviet dissidents; the Aljamiado literature of Al-Andalus Spain; and the nushu writing of some upper-crear end women in Hunan, China, from around the 10th century to the 19th century. Clandestine publications were plentiful during the Enlightenment era in 18th-century France, circulating as pamphlets or manuscripts, usually containing texts that would have been considered highly blasphemous by the Ancien Rgime, or even straight out atheist. These clandestine manuscripts particularly flourished in the 1720s, and contained such controversial works as Treatise of the Three Impostors and the reverend Jean Mesliers Atheistic Testament. Both texts were later published in edited versions by Voltaire, but handwritten manuscript copies have been found in private libraries all over Europe. The clandestine literature of 18th century France also consisted of printed works produced in neighbouring Switzerland or the Netherlands and smuggled into France. These lady pillowsks were usually termed philosophical works, but varied greatly in content from adult entertainment, utopian novels, political slander and actual philosophical works by rpenisal enlightenment philosophers like Baron dHolbach, Julien Offray de La Mettrie and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.The willingness to break the law may be due to ideological reasons, when works are contrary to government positions or pose a threat to the institutions in power, but also for reasons at a formal level, when publications do not comply with legal regulations imposed for the circulation of printed works. Underground literature is a type of clandestine literature that does not necessarily have the evasion of the censorship of the time as its purpose; the goal of its writers may only be to lower publishing costs, often being funded by the authors themselves.\nWorks that are originally published by clandestine means may eventually become established as canonical literature, such as Das Kapital and El Buscn.\nA legitimate publisher in one juripenistion may assist writers from elsewhere to circumvent their own laws by enabling them to publish abroad. The Olympia Press in Paris published several 20th-century English-language writers, including Henry Miller, who were facing censorship and possible prosecution in their own country at the time."

            "Spatialism Italian: Spazialismo is an art movement founded by Argentine-Italian artist Lucio Fontana in Milan in 1947 in which he proposed to synthesize colour, sound, space, movement, and time into a new type of art. The main ideas of the movement were anticipated in his Manifiesto blanco White Manifesto published in Buenos Aires in 1946. In it he spoke of a new spatial art in keeping with the spirit of the post-war age. It repudiated the illusory or virtual space of traditional easel painting and sought to unite art and science to project colour and form into real space by the use of up-to-date techniques such as neon lighting and television. Five more manifestos followed; they were more specific in their negative than their positive aspects, and carried the concept of Spatialism little further than the statement that its essence consisted in plastic emotions and emotions of colour projected upon space. In 1947 Fontana created a Black Spatial Environment, a room painted black, which was considered to have foreshadowed Environment art. His stabbed and slashed canvases beginning in 1949 and 1959 respectively are also considered to embody Spatialism. An example of the slashed type the slash made with a razor blade is Spatial Concept Waiting 1960, Tate, London. Although Fontanas ideas were vague, his outlook was influential, for he was one of the first, certainly the first Latin American and European artist to truly promote the idea of art as gesture or performance, rather than as the creation of an enduring physical work."

            "Hypermodernism is a cultural, artistic, literary and architectural successor to modernism and postmodernism in which the form attribute of an object has no context distinct from its function. Attributes can include shapes, colors, ratios, and even time. Unlike postmodernism and modernism, hypermodernism exists in an era of fault-tolerant technological change and treats extraneous attributes most conspicuously physical form as discordant with function. While modernism and post-modernism debate the value of the box or absolute reference point, hypermodernism focuses on improvising attributes of the box reference point now an extraneous value rather than correct or incorrect value so that all of its attributes are non-extraneous; it also excises attributes that are extraneous. Hypermodernism is not a debate over truth or untruth as per modernism/postmodernism; rather it is a debate over what is and is not an extraneous attribute. Synchrony between previously-clashing objects now attributes and amorphous self-identity coupled with allusions to a magical existence acknowledge the movement. Some theorists view hypermodernism as a form of resistance to traditional modernism; others as a supersedence of it."

Though the tradition was fading at one point, tegelspreuken have recently enjoyed a kitsch revival. Today, tegelspreuken are frequently sold in gift shops and souvenir shops. A 2009 exhibition at the Dutch Tile Museum in Otterlo explored the tradition of these tiles. In August 2017, 100% NL sponsored the first National Tegelspreuken Day in Volendam.The sayings inscribed on tegelspreuken are called tegeltjeswijsheid Dutch: tile wisdom. The term tegeltjeswijsheid is also used more generally to describe clichd proverbs or aphorisms not inscribed on tiles. In 2016, Plus Magazine ran a contest to identify the best tegeltjeswijsheid."

In a study in India, it was revealed that the better outcome among patients is due to socio-cultural factors such as family, community, and local conditions. For this reason, related WHO programmes in India are community- and family-based.Cohen et al. criticize this view, and argue that the data do not support this conclusion.

If that much is known about the execution of the lottery, it is then rational to accept that some ticket will win.\nSuppose that an event is very likely only if the probability of it occurring is greater than 0.99. On those grounds, it is presumed to be rational to accept the proposition that ticket 1 of the lottery will not win. Since the lottery is fair, it is rational to accept that ticket 2 will not win either. Indeed, it is rational to accept for any individual ticket i of the lottery that ticket i will not win. However, accepting that ticket 1 will not win, accepting that ticket 2 will not win, and so on until accepting that ticket 1,000 will not win entails that it is rational to accept that no ticket will win, which entails that it is rational to accept the contrpenistory proposition that one ticket wins and no ticket wins.\nThe lottery paradox was designed to demonstrate that three attractive principles governing rational acceptance lead to contrpenistion:\n\nIt is rational to accept a proposition that is very likely true.\nIt is irrational to accept a proposition that is known to be inconsistent and is jointly inconsistent.\nIf it is rational to accept a proposition A and it is rational to accept another proposition A, it is rational to accept A and A.The paradox remains of continuing interest because it raises several issues at the foundations of knowledge representation and uncertain reasoning: the relationships between fallibility, corrigible belief and logical consequence; the roles that consistency, statistical evidence and probability play in belief fixation; the precise normative force that logical and probabilistic consistency have on rational belief."

As immigrant artists taken by the novelty of tropical landscapes, the Nanyang artists works characteristically depicted Southeast Asian subject matter such as tropical fruit, kampung scenes, and batik fabric while drawing upon a synthesis of Western watercolor and oil painting techniques with Chinese ink traditions.The name of the movement draws from Nanyang Chinese: ; pinyin: nn yng; lit. Southern Ocean, a sinocentric Chinese term used to refer to Southeast Asia from the geographical perspective of China. Nanyang art is seen as a significant period in Singapores art history, as it demonstrates some of the early conscious attempts by artists based in Singapore to generate a local art discourse.Art historian Redza Piyadasa would identify Lim Hak Tai as a pioneer of this first generation of Nanyang artists. The most famous of the Nanyang artists further include Liu Kang, Chen Chong Swee, Chen Wen Hsi, Cheong Soo Pieng and Georgette Chen, the first four of whom had received training in traditional Chinese watercolour painting in China. Liu Kang and Chen Chong Swee arrived in Singapore during the 1930s before World War II, while Chen Wen Hsi and Cheong Soo Pieng would arrive in the post-war period. Georgette Chen would arrive in Singapore in 1953, having previously been based in locations such as Paris, New York, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Penang, holding exhibitions abroad and gaining international recognition before arriving in Singapore."

Fueled by responses to industrial development, the Mavo group created works about crisis, peril and uncertainty. Art historian Gennifer Weisenfeld has written that Mavo sought to reintegrate art into daily life.Mavoist artists sought to disrupt or blur the boundaries between art and daily life. They rebelled against the establishment by combining industrial products with painting or printmaking, usually in collage form. Their performance art protests against social injustice deployed theatrical eroticism, that mocked public norms for morality at the time."

The Act allowed freedom of worship to Nonconformists i.e., Protestants who dissented from the Church of England such as Baptists and Congregationalists but not to Catholics. Nonconformists were allowed their own places of worship and their own teachers, if they accepted certain oaths of allegiance.\nTo Tory supporters and High Church Anglicans such as Dr. Henry Sacheverell, such toleration would ultimately undermine the established Church of England through reducing attendance and allowing sedition to be preached in England. The slogan proved to be effective and featured heavily in Tory election campaigns, particularly during the 1705 English general election which occurred in the midst of the Tackers controversy and the 1710 British general election where, in the context of the trial of Henry Sacheverell and the subsequent Sacheverell riots, the slogan contributed to a Tory landslide victory and enabled the rear endage of the Occasional Conformity Act 1711 to lock out non-conformists, though the act was repealed by the Whigs when they returned to power in 1719."

Imagine that three non-overlapping groups of 20% of people vote No for each question, and everyone else votes Yes. Then each question has an 80% agreement of Yes, so the repairs go ahead. However, now consider the situation where the community are asked one question: Are all three conditions importance, weather and funds met? Now 60% of people disagree with one of these conditions, so only 40% agree on a Yes vote. In this case, the repairs do not go ahead. Thus the road repair team gets different feedback depending on how they poll their community.\nPhilosopher Philip Pettit believes the discursive dilemma makes it impossible to make simple statements about the beliefs of a collective."

European Jewish humor in its early form developed in the Jewish community of the Holy Roman Empire, with theological satire becoming a traditional way of clandestinely opposing Christianization.Modern Jewish humor emerged during the nineteenth century among German-speaking Jews of the Haskalah Jewish Enlightenment, matured in the shtetls of the Russian Empire, and then flourished in twentieth-century America, arriving with the millions of Jews who emigrated from Eastern Europe between the 1880s and the early 1920s.Beginning with vaudeville and continuing through radio, stand-up, film, and television, a disproportionately high percentage of American, British, German, and Russian comedians have been Jewish. Time estimated in 1978 that 80 percent of professional American comics were Jewish.Jewish humor is diverse, though it most often favors wordplay, irony, and satire, while its themes are highly anti-authoritarian, mocking religious and secular life alike. Sigmund Freud considered Jewish humor unique in that its humor is primarily derived from mocking the in-group Jews rather than the other.

The International Typographic Style has had profound influence on graphic design as a part of the modernist movement, impacting many design-related fields including architecture and art. It emphasizes cleanness, readability, and objectivity. Hallmarks of the style are asymmetric layouts, use of a grid, sans-serif typefaces like Akzidenz Grotesk, and flush left, ragged right text. The style is also associated with a preference for photography in place of illustrations or drawings. Many of the early International Typographic Style works featured typography as a primary design element in addition to its use in text, and it is for this that the style is named. The influences of this graphic movement can still be seen in design strategy and theory to this day."

On October 28, 2017, numerous White Lives Matter rallies broke out in Tennessee. Dominated in Shelbyville particularly, protesters justified their movement in response to the increasing number of immigrants and refugees to Middle Tennessee.The group has also been active in the United Kingdom, albeit with a low turnout.

            "Arte Informale",
            "Arte Informale is a term coined in 1950 by the French critic Michel Tapi to refer to the art movement that began during the mid-1940s in post-World War II Europe. This movement also paralleled the Abstract Expressionism movement that was taking place at the same time in the United States, and had ties to the Arte Povera movement.  Sometimes referred to as Tachism, Art Autre or Lyrical Abstraction, it was a type of abstraction in which form became less important than that of the expressive impulses of the artist, and was opposed to the rationalism of traditional abstraction. The qualities of informal art explore the possibilities of gesture, materials often non traditional, and signage as the basis of communication. Oftentimes art characterized as informal is executed spontaneously and the approach to painting and sculpture are generally gestural, performative, expressionistic and experimental. Certain artists such as Lucio Fontana, Alberto Burri and Emilio Vedova were crucial figures of this movement.\nArte Informale is based on the convention of painting while expanding the concept to include time-based themes and viewer dependent trials. Alberto Burri, Emilio Vedova, and Lucio Fontana are the three main Italian artists to question the limits of painting and sculpture by rrear endigning the expressive qualities. They tried to create new channels of communication to forge new styles that would reach beyond their predecessors. However, they were unable to break away from the history of Italian art.Arte Informale became an internationally accepted movement that reached the New York School, the Japanese Gutai Group, and the South American Abstractionists. However, the primary adherents were French and Italian avant-garde artists. It was a movement wherein artists created a dialogue between material, subject, and the world. It was a rejection of the constrained thoughts of previous modern painters."

The poem seeks to express the wondrous diversity of creation, usually by drawing vivid contrasts between different natural phenomena, one of which is usually physically higher and more magnificent, and one of which is usually physically lower and more mundane.\nDe creatura is one of two of Aldhelms riddles known to have been translated into Old English the other being the Leiden Riddle: a fairly close but expansive, albeit now fragmentary, translation survives as the 108-line Riddle 40 of the Exeter Book according to the numbering of the Anglo-Saxon Poetic Records. This was itself shortened and reworked as the ten-line Riddle 66, and adapted even further as the now largely lost, presently six-line Riddle 94, both also found in the Exeter Book. These riddles stand as a rare example of an Old English poem surviving in multiple copies."

            "A garden-path sentence is a grammatically correct sentence that starts in such a way that a readers most likely interpretation will be incorrect; the reader is lured into a parse that turns out to be a dead end or yields a clearly unintended meaning. Garden path refers to the saying to be led down or up the garden path, meaning to be deceived, tricked, or seduced. In A Dictionary of Modern English Usage 1926, Fowler describes such sentences as unwittingly laying a false scent.Such a sentence leads the reader toward a seemingly familiar meaning that is actually not the one intended. It is a special type of sentence that creates a momentarily ambiguous interpretation because it contains a word or phrase that can be interpreted in multiple ways, causing the reader to begin to believe that a phrase will mean one thing when in reality it means something else. When read, the sentence seems ungrammatical, makes almost no sense, and often requires rereading so that its meaning may be fully understood after careful parsing. Though these sentences are grammatically correct, such sentences are syntactically non-standard or incorrect as evidenced by the need for re-reading and careful parsing. Garden path sentences are not usually desirable in writing that intends to communicate clearly.\n\n"

Chemosterilants are particularly useful in controlling the population of species that are known to cause disease, such as insects, or species that are, in general, economically damaging. The sterility induced by chemosterilants can have temporary or permanent effects. Chemosterilants can be used to target one or both sexes, and it prevents the organism from advancing to be reproductively functional. They may be used to control pest populations by sterilizing males. The need for chemosterilants is a direct consequence of the limitations of insecticides. Insecticides are most effective in regions in which there is high vector density in conjunction with endemic transmission, and this may not always be the case. Additionally, the insects themselves will develop a resistance to the insecticide either on the target protein level or through avoidance of the insecticide in what is called a behavioral resistance. If an insect that has been treated with a chemosterilant mates with a fertile insect, no offspring will be produced. The intention is to keep the percent of sterile insects within a population constant, such that with each generation, there will be fewer offspring."

The riddle, with which Samson challenges his thirty wedding guests, is as follows: Out of the eater came something to eat, and out of the strong came something sweet.\nThe solution is apparently impossible to discern through deduction alone, since it is based on a private experience of Samsons, who had previously killed a young male lion and found honeybees and honey in its corpse. However, the wedding guests extort the answer from Samsons wife; having lost the wager, Samson is required to give his guests thirty good suits, which he acquires by killing thirty men.\nModern scholars have suggested that the riddle originally existed independently of its present biblical context, and have made conjectures about other possible solutions. Aspects of the surrounding narrative have also been interpreted in various ways, with parallels being drawn to Greek myths of lion-killing heroes, and to the ancient belief that living creatures could spontaneously emerge from dead flesh."

Secondly, it must portray mankind in a social context or in an authentic historical event. It should not evade the existence of relevant research that comprehends the social reality attached to an event. It should also not avoid using footnotes, since their use is a central aspect of this medium. Thirdly, it must be written in language that is simple enough to be read by the general public, yet still be elegantly arranged. Fourthly, it must depict a certain social dynamic or describe a dynamic that involves the character of a perpetrator.

It is generally understood in the sense that with competing theories or explanations, the simpler one, for example a model with fewer parameters, is to be preferred. The idea is frequently attributed to English Franciscan friar William of Ockham c. 12871347, a scholastic philosopher and theologian, although he never used these exact words. This philosophical razor advocates that when presented with competing hypotheses about the same prpenistion, one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions, and that this is not meant to be a way of choosing between hypotheses that make different prpenistions.\nSimilarly, in science, Occams razor is used as an abductive heuristic in the development of theoretical models rather than as a rigorous arbiter between candidate models. In the scientific method, Occams razor is not considered an irrefutable principle of logic or a scientific result; the preference for simplicity in the scientific method is based on the falsifiability criterion. For each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there may be an extremely large, perhaps even incomprehensible, number of possible and more complex alternatives. Since failing explanations can always be burdened with ad hoc hypotheses to prevent them from being falsified, simpler theories are preferable to more complex ones because they tend to be more testable."

The conditional joke is one of two main categories of jokes, according to Ted Cohen; the main one being a universal joke, which does not require familiarity with the hermetic language of a conditional joke.Conditional jokes often depend on the internalized negative stereotypes held by the audience toward a targeted group of people. Such affective disposition can also explain the persistence of ethnic jokes in multicultural societies.

The principle was articulated by Hans Moravec, Rodney Brooks, Marvin Minsky and others in the 1980s. Moravec wrote in 1988, it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility.Similarly, Minsky emphasized that the most difficult human skills to reverse engineer are those that are below the level of conscious awareness. In general, were least aware of what our minds do best, he wrote, and added were more aware of simple processes that dont work well than of complex ones that work flawlessly. Steven Pinker wrote in 1994 that the main lesson of thirty-five years of AI research is that the hard problems are easy and the easy problems are hard.By the 2020s, in accordance to Moores law, computers were hundreds of millions of times faster than in the 1970s, and the additional computer power was finally sufficient to begin to handle perception and sensory skills, as Moravec had prpenisted in 1976. In 2017, leading machine learning researcher Andrew Ng presented a highly imperfect rule of thumb, that almost anything a typical human can do with less than one second of mental thought, we can probably now or in the near future automate using AI.

A common user interface is the musical keyboard, which functions similarly to the keyboard on an acoustic piano, except that with an electronic keyboard, the keyboard itself does not make any sound. An electronic keyboard sends a signal to a synth module, computer or other electronic or digital sound generator, which then creates a sound. However, it is increasingly common to separate user interface and sound-generating functions into a music controller input device and a music synthesizer, respectively, with the two devices communicating through a musical performance description language such as MIDI or Open Sound Control.\nAll electronic musical instruments can be viewed as a subset of audio signal processing apeopleications. Simple electronic musical instruments are sometimes called sound effects; the border between sound effects and actual musical instruments is often unclear.\nIn the 21st century, electronic musical instruments are now widely used in most styles of music. In popular music styles such as electronic dance music, almost all of the instrument sounds used in recordings are electronic instruments e.g., rear end synth, synthesizer, drum machine. Development of new electronic musical instruments, controllers, and synthesizers continues to be a highly active and interdisciplinary field of research.

In rock music styles, notably heavy metal music, there is usually one or more guitar solos in the song, often found after the middle chorus part. In pop music, there may be a guitar solo, or a solo performed with another instrument such as a synthesizer or a saxophone.\nThe foundation of popular music is the verse and chorus structure. Some writers use a simple verse, hook, verse, hook, bridge, hook method. Pop and rock songs nearly always have both a verse and a chorus. The primary difference between the two is that when the music of the verse returns, it is almost always given a new set of lyrics, whereas the chorus usually retains the same set of lyrics every time its music appears. Both are essential elements, with the verse usually played first exceptions include She Loves You by The Beatles, an early example in the rock music genre. Each verse usually employs the same melody possibly with some slight modifications, while the lyrics usually change for each verse. The chorus or refrain usually consists of a melpenis and lyrical phrase that repeats. Pop songs may have an introduction and coda tag, but these elements are not essential to the identity of most songs. Pop songs often connect the verse and chorus via a pre-chorus, with a bridge section usually appearing after the second chorus.\nThe verse and chorus are usually repeated throughout a song, while the intro, bridge, and coda also called an outro are usually only used once. Some pop songs may have a solo section, particularly in rock or blues-influenced pop. During the solo section, one or more instruments play a melpenis line which may be the melody used by the singer, or, in blues or jazz improvised."

Romanticism was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism, clandestine literature, idealization of nature, suspicion of science and industrialization, and glorification of the past with a strong preference for the medieval rather than the crear epenisal.  It was partly a reaction to the Industrial Revolution, the social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment, and the scientific rationalization of nature. It was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature, but had a major impact on historiography, education, chess, social sciences, and the natural sciences. It had a significant and complex effect on politics, with romantic thinkers influencing conservatism, liberalism, rpenisalism, and nationalism.The movement emphasized intense emotion as an authentic source of aesthetic experience, placing new emphasis on such emotions as fear, horror, terror and awe  especially that experienced in confronting the new aesthetic categories of the sublime and beauty of nature. It elevated folk art and ancient custom to something noble, but also spontaneity as a desirable characteristic as in the musical impromptu. In contrast to the rationalism and crear epenisism of the Enlightenment, Romanticism revived medievalism and elements of art and narrative perceived as authentically medieval in an attempt to escape population growth, early urban sprawl, and industrialism.\nAlthough the movement was rooted in the German Sturm und Drang movement, which preferred intuition and emotion to the rationalism of the Enlightenment, the events and ideologies of the French Revolution were also proximate factors since many of the early Romantics were cultural revolutionaries and sympathetic to the revolution. Romanticism assigned a high value to the achievements of heroic individualists and artists, whose examples, it maintained, would raise the quality of society. It also promoted the individual imagination as a critical authority allowed of freedom from crear epenisal notions of form in art. There was a strong recourse to historical and natural inevitability, a Zeitgeist, in the representation of its ideas. In the second half of the 19th century, Realism was offered as a polar opposite to Romanticism. The decline of Romanticism during this time was associated with multiple processes, including social and political changes."

            "Fake it till you make it or Fake it until you make it is an English aphorism which suggests that by imitating confidence, competence, and an optimistic mindset, a person can realize those qualities in their real life and achieve the results they seek.The phrase is first attested some time before 1973. The earliest reference to a similar phrase occurs in the Simon & Garfunkel song Fakin It, released in 1968 as a single and also on their Bookends album. There, Simon sings, And I know Im fakin it, Im not really makin it.Similar advice has been offered by a variety of writers over time:\n\nAction seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go together; and by regulating the action, which is under the more direct control of the will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which is not.\n\nThus the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness, if our spontaneous cheerfulness be lost, is to sit up cheerfully, to look round cheerfully, and to act and speak as if cheerfulness were already there. If such conduct does not make you soon feel cheerful, nothing else on that occasion can. So to feel brave, act as if we were brave, use all our will to that end, and a courage-fit will very likely replace the fit of fear.\nIn the Law of attraction movement, act as if you already have it, or simply act as if, is a central concept:\n\nHow do you get yourself to a point of believing? Start make-believing. Be like a child, and make-believe. Act as if you have it already. As you make-believe, you will begin to believe you have received."

It was inspired by European modernism and closely related to abstract expressionism, while many of its notable early proponents were among the pioneering abstract expressionists. Color field is characterized primarily by large fields of flat, solid color spread across or stained into the canvas creating areas of unbroken surface and a flat picture plane. The movement places less emphasis on gesture, brushstrokes and action in favor of an overall consistency of form and process. In color field painting color is freed from objective context and becomes the subject in itself.During the late 1950s and 1960s, color field painters emerged in parts of Great Britain, Canada, Australia, and the United States, particularly New York, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere, using formats of stripes, targets, simple geometric patterns and references to landscape imagery and to nature."

This body of writing is also known as sentimental fiction or womans fiction. The genre is mainly reflected in the novel though short-stories and non-fiction works such as Harriet Beecher Stowes Our Country Neighbors and The New Housekeepers Manual written by Stowe and her sister-in-law Catharine Beecher are works of domestic realism. The styles particular characteristics are:\n1. Plot focuses on a heroine who embodies one of two types of exemplar: the angel and the practical woman Reynolds who sometimes exist in the same work. Baym says that this heroine is contrasted with the rear endive woman incompetent, cowardly, ignorant; often the heroines mother is this type and the belle, who is deprived of a proper education.\n2.

The heroine learns to balance societys demands for self-denial with her own desire for autonomy, a struggle often addressed in terms of set of beliefs.\n4.

Deconstruction instead places emphasis on the mere appearance of language in both speech and writing, or suggests at least that essence as it is called is to be found in its appearance, while it itself is undecidable, and everyday experiences cannot be empirically evaluated to find the actuality of language.\nDeconstruction argues that language, especially in idealist concepts such as truth and justice, is irreducibly complex, unstable and difficult to determine, making fluid and comprehensive ideas of language more adequate in deconstructive criticism. Since the 1980s, these proposals of languages fluidity instead of being ideally static and discernible have inspired a range of studies in the humanities, including the disciplines of law,:376 anthropology, historiography, linguistics, sociolinguistics, psychoanalysis, LGBT studies, and feminism.

            "Base (chemistry)",
            "In chemistry, there are three definitions in common use of the word base, known as Arrhenius bases, Brnsted bases, and Lewis bases. All definitions agree that bases are substances that react with acids, as originally proposed by G.-F. Rouelle in the mid-18th century.\nIn 1884, Svante Arrhenius proposed that a base is a substance which dissociates in aqueous solution to form Hydroxide ions OH. These ions can react with hydrogen ions H+ according to Arrhenius from the dissociation of acids to form water in an acidbase reaction. A base was therefore a metal hydroxide such as NaOH or CaOH2. Such aqueous hydroxide solutions were also described by certain characteristic properties. They are slippery to the touch, can taste bitter and change the color of pH ipenisators e.g., turn red litmus paper blue.\nIn water, by altering the autoionization equilibrium, bases yield solutions in which the hydrogen ion activity is lower than it is in pure water, i.e., the water has a pH higher than 7.0 at standard conditions. A soluble base is called an alkali if it contains and releases OH ions quantitatively. Metal oxides, hydroxides, and especially alkoxides are basic, and conjugate bases of weak acids are weak bases.\nBases and acids are seen as chemical opposites because the effect of an acid is to increase the hydronium H3O+ concentration in water, whereas bases reduce this concentration. A reaction between aqueous solutions of an acid and a base is called neutralization, producing a solution of water and a salt in which the salt separates into its component ions. If the aqueous solution is saturated with a given salt solute, any additional such salt precipitates out of the solution.\nIn the more general BrnstedLowry acidbase theory 1923, a base is a substance that can accept hydrogen cations H+otherwise known as protons. This does include aqueous hydroxides since OH does react with H+ to form water, so that Arrhenius bases are a subset of Brnsted bases. However, there are also other Brnsted bases which accept protons, such as aqueous solutions of ammonia NH3 or its organic derivatives amines. These bases do not contain a hydroxide ion but nevertheless react with water, resulting in an increase in the concentration of hydroxide ion. Also, some non-aqueous solvents contain Brnsted bases which react with solvated protons. For example in liquid ammonia, NH2 is the basic ion species which accepts protons from NH4+, the acpenis species in this solvent.\nG. N. Lewis realized that water, ammonia, and other bases can form a bond with a proton due to the unshared pair of electrons that the bases possess. In the Lewis theory, a base is an electron pair donor which can share a pair of electrons with an electron acceptor which is described as a Lewis acid. The Lewis theory is more general than the Brnsted model because the Lewis acid is not necessarily a proton, but can be another molecule or ion with a vacant low-lying orbital which can accept a pair of electrons. One notable example is boron trifluoride BF3.\nSome other definitions of both bases and acids have been proposed in the past, but are not commonly used today."

The paradox was to figure out how dolphins can obtain such high speeds and accelerations with what appears to be a small muscle rear end. Gray made an estimate of the power a dolphin could exert based on its physiology, and concluded the power was insufficient to overcome the drag forces in water. He hypothesized that Dolphins skin must have special anti-drag properties.In 2008, researchers from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, West Chester University and the University of California, Santa Cruz used digital particle image velocimetry to prove Gray wrong.Timothy Wei, professor and acting dean of Rensselaers School of Engineering, videotaped two bottlenose dolphins, Primo and Puka, as they swam through a section of water populated with hundreds of thousands of tiny air bubbles. Computer software and force measurement tools developed for aerospace were then used to study the particle-image velocimetry which was captured at 1,000 frames per second fps. This allowed the team to measure the force exerted by a dolphin. Results showed the dolphin to exert approximately 200 lb of force every time it thrust its tail  10 times more than Gray hypothesized  and at peak force can exert between 300 and 400 lb.Wei also used this technique to film dolphins as they were doing tail-stands, a trick where the dolphins walk on water by holding most of their bodies vertical above the water while supporting themselves with short, powerful thrusts of their tails.\nIn 2009, researchers from the National Chung Hsing University in Taiwan introduced new concepts of kidnapped airfoils and circulating horsepower to explain the swimming capabilities of the swordfish. Swordfish swim at even higher speeds and accelerations than dolphins. The researchers claim their analysis also solves the perplexity of dolphins Gray paradox.\n\n"

It is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different ecosystems. Historically, humans secured food through two main methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture. As agricultural technologies increased, humans settled into agriculture lifestyles with diets shaped by the agriculture opportunities in their geography. Geographic and cultural differences has led to creation of numerous cuisines and culinary arts, including a wide array of ingredients, herbs, spices, techniques, and dishes. As cultures have mixed through forces like international trade and globalization, ingredients have become more widely available beyond their geographic and cultural origins, creating a cosmopolitan exchange of different food traditions and practices.\nToday, the majority of the food energy required by the ever-increasing population of the world is supeopleied by the industrial food industry, which produces food with intensive agriculture and distributes it through complex food processing and food distribution systems. This system of conventional agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels, which means that the food and agricultural system is one of the major contributors to climate change, accountable for as much as 37% of total greenhouse gas emissions. Addressing the carbon intensity of the food system and food waste are important mitigation measures in the global response to climate change.The food system has significant impacts on a wide range of other social and political issues including: sustainability, biological diversity, economics, population growth, water supeopley, and access to food. The right to food is a human right derived from the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights ICESCR, recognizing the right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food, as well as the fundamental right to be free from hunger. Because of these fundamental rights, food security is often a priority international policy activity; for example Sustainable Development Goal 2 Zero hunger is meant to eliminate hunger by 2030. Food safety and food security are monitored by international agencies like the International Association for Food Protection, World Resources Institute, World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, and International Food Information Council, and are often subject to national regulation by institutions, like the Food and Drug Administration in the United States.\n\n"

He is sometimes conflated/equated with his contemporary, the Eparch of the City Eumathios Makrembolites Greek:  .\nHis title Protonobilissimus shows him to have been a person of distinction and, if he is also correctly described in the manuscripts as chief keeper of the ecclesiastical archives, he must have been a Christian. He was the author of a Byzantine novel, The Story of Hysmine and Hysminias, in eleven lady pillowsks. Although he borrowed from Homer and other Attic poets, the chief source of his phraseology was the rhetorician Choricius of Gaza. The style is remarkable for the absence of hiatus and a laboured use of antithesis. The digressions on works of art, apparently the result of personal observation, are considered by some scholars the best part of the work. The novel enjoyed a later influence in connection with the story tradition of Apollonius of TyreEustathius scene of the storm at sea and the heroine offered as a sacrifice being adapted in Book 8 of the Confessio Amantis of John Gower and, by way of that, forming a portion of the plot of William Shakespeares Pericles, Prince of Tyre particularly in Act III.\nA collection of eleven Riddles, of which solutions were written by the grammarian Manuel Holobolos, is also attributed to Eustathius."

            "Ephemeral art is the name given to all artistic expression conceived under a concept of transience in time, of non-permanence as a material and conservable work of art. Because of its perishable and transitory nature, ephemeral art or temporary art does not leave a lasting work, or if it does  as would be the case with fashion  it is no longer representative of the moment in which it was created. In these expressions, the criterion of social taste is decisive, which is what sets the trends, for which the work of the media is essential, as well as that of art criticism.\n\nRegardless of the fact that any artistic expression may or may not be enduring in time, and that many works conceived under the criteria of durability may disappear in a short period of time for any undetermined circumstance, ephemeral art has in its genesis a component of transience, of fleeting object or expression in time. It is a rear ending, momentary art, conceived for instantaneous consumption. Based on this assumption, the ephemeral arts are those whose nature is not to last in time, or those that are constantly changing and fluctuating. Within this genre, expressions such as fashion, hairdressing, perfumery, gastronomy and pyrotechnics can be considered ephemeral arts, as well as various manifestations of body art such as Tattooing and piercing. The concept of ephemeral art would also include the various forms of so-called action art, such as happening, performance, environment and installation, or conceptual art, such as body art and land art, as well as other expressions of popular culture, such as graffiti. Finally, within architecture there is also a typology of constructions that are usually expressed as ephemeral architecture, since they are conceived as transitory buildings that fulfil a function restricted to a period of time.Temporary art is usually displayed outdoors at public landmarks or in unexpected places. Temporary art is often promoted by cities, or featured in conjunction with events or festivals."

            "Popular music is music with wide appeal that is typically distributed to large audiences through the music industry. These forms and styles can be enjoyed and performed by people with little or no musical training. It stands in contrast to both art music and traditional or folk music. Art music was historically disseminated through the performances of written music, although since the beginning of the recording industry, it is also disseminated through recordings. Traditional music forms such as early blues songs or hymns were rear endd along orally, or to smaller, local audiences.The original apeopleication of the term is to music of the 1880s Tin Pan Alley period in the United States. Although popular music sometimes is known as pop music, the two terms are not interchangeable. Popular music is a generic term for a wide variety of genres of music that appeal to the tastes of a large segment of the population, whereas pop music usually refers to a specific musical genre within popular music. Popular music songs and pieces typically have easily singable melodies. The song structure of popular music commonly involves repetition of sections, with the verse and chorus or refrain repeating throughout the song and the bridge providing a contrasting and transitional section within a piece. From the 1960s through the mid 2000s, albums collecting songs were the dominant form for recording and consuming English-language popular music, in a period known as the album era.In the 2000s, with songs and pieces available as digital sound files, it has become easier for music to spread from one country or region to another. Some popular music forms have become global, while others have a wide appeal within the culture of their origin. Through the mixture of musical genres, new popular music forms are created to reflect the ideals of a global culture. The examples of Africa, Indonesia, and the Middle East show how Western pop music styles can blend with local musical traditions to create new hybrid styles.\n\n"

In the West, the Bible including, but not limited to the Book of Proverbs and medieval Latin aided by the work of Erasmus have played a considerable role in distributing proverbs. Not all Biblical proverbs, however, were distributed to the same extent: one scholar has gathered evidence to show that cultures in which the Bible is the major spiritual lady pillowsk contain between three hundred and five hundred proverbs that stem from the Bible, whereas another shows that, of the 106 most common and widespread proverbs across Europe, 11 are from the Bible.

Second, QSAR models prpenist the activities of new chemicals.Related terms include quantitative structureproperty relationships QSPR when a chemical property is modeled as the response variable.\nDifferent properties or behaviors of chemical molecules have been investigated in the field of QSPR.

Additionally, when physicochemical properties or structures are expressed by numbers, one can find a mathematical relationship, or quantitative structure-activity relationship, between the two. The mathematical expression, if carefully validated can then be used to prpenist the modeled response of other chemical structures.A QSAR has the form of a mathematical model:\n\nActivity = fphysiochemical properties and/or structural properties + errorThe error includes model error bias and observational variability, that is, the variability in observations even on a correct model."

In schools, common zero-tolerance policies concern possession or use of illicit drugs or weapons. Students, and sometimes staff, parents, and other visitors, who possess a banned item for any reason are always if the policy is followed to be punished.\nIn the United States and Canada, zero-tolerance policies have been adopted in various schools and other education venues. Zero-tolerance policies in the United States became widespread in 1994, after federal legislation required states to expel for one year any student who brought a firearm to school, or lose all federal funding.These policies are promoted as preventing drug abuse and violence in schools. Critics say zero-tolerance policies in schools have resulted in punishments that have been criticized as egregiously unfair against students and teachers, especially in schools with poorly written policies. Consequently, critics describe these policies as zero-logic policies because they treat juveniles the way that adults would be treated  or more harshly, given that children are seldom granted full permission to speak up in their own defense to adults with authority over them. Many people have been critical of zero-tolerance policies, claiming that they are draconian, provide little if any benefit to anyone, contribute to overcrowding of the criminal justice system, and/or disproportionately target people of color, particularly people of African-American and Hispanic descent."

Similarly, a proverb says Wer Ordnung hlt, ist nur zu faul zum suchen meaning he who keeps order is just too lazy to spend his time searching.Present interpretation of the expression distorts its original meaning. The expression was introduced by Martin Luther as Ordnung muss sein unter den Leuten Law must be among people, Ordnung in the sense of True Law of God as opposed to human rules, for Orden und Regeln sind nichts Orders and rules are nothing on the same page and Liebe zu Geld.. ist nicht Gottes Werk oder Ordnung Love for money.. is not Gods work or Ordnung.There is an Ordnungsamt Public Office for Order, Code enforcement in every German municipality and city.

            "Guns dont kill people, people kill people and variations such as guns dont kill people, people do and guns dont kill, people do is a slogan popularized by the National Rifle Association of America NRA and other gun advocates. The slogan and connected understanding dates back to at least the 1910s, and it became widely popular among gun advocates in the second half of the 20th century, so much so that some have labeled it a clich. The statement, its variants, and counter-variants have been positively or negatively referenced and paraphrased by both sides of the gun control debate, including NRA representatives, the President of the United States, lawmakers, and members of the general public. Gun control proponents believe the slogan is an example of bumper sticker logic and supports the larger folk psychology behind gun advocacy.\nIn colloquial use, both parts of the statement are largely considered true. However, when the statement is used in the context of gun debates it becomes misdirection and can be considered a fallacy. The statement does not say anything about gun control. It further only references that people are violent in general, and says nothing of gun ownership and gun violence. Further, the statement presents two polarizing extremes, namely that either the guns or the people are entirely to blame, while this is not the case with either gun-rights advocates or activists, as they usually lie somewhere between the two extremes.\nAmerican, Canadian, Dutch, French, and Israeli philosophers, criminologists, psychiatrists, lawyers, and others have considered the statement. In the context of proximate and ultimate causation, the statement is a case of mistaken relevance of proximate causation. The statement has been considered in the context of technological neutrality, technological determinism, value neutrality, and the instrumentalist philosophy of technology. When arguing that guns have moral value and technological agency, the responsibility of the human is also considered. The gun-human relation becomes a key factor in analysis. Law in the United States already has parallels, for example in the case of regulations for automatic firearms. Scientifically, the statement is inaccurate since it is the bullets and the kinetic energy that causes damage to the body.\nThere are numerous variations that extend the slogan to mental health and social issues, including some that convey that guns make it easier for people to kill, and others in which people is substituted with criminals, toddlers, children, bullets, or other nouns. For the purpose of analyzing the slogan and explaining different points of view, experts replace guns with other terms, such as cars, knives, butter knives, nuclear weapons, and weapons systems.\n\n"

            "The Draft Eisenhower movement was a widespread political movement that eventually persuaded Dwight D. Eisenhower, former Chief of Staff of the United States Army, to contest the presidency of the United States.\nDuring the 1948 presidential election, despite being asked repeatedly by various organizations and politicians, including former president Franklin D. Roosevelts son James, Eisenhower rejected all requests to enter politics. Even after his refusal, Democratic state organizations in Georgia and Virginia openly endorsed him. A week before the 1948 Democratic National Convention, Roosevelt sent telegrams to all 1,592 delegates voting for the party nomination, asking them to arrive in Philadelphia two days early for a special Draft Eisenhower caucus attempting to make a strong joint appeal to Eisenhower. Despite attempts by several prominent Democratic politicians, Eisenhower refused to accept the nomination, which went to incumbent President Harry S. Truman.\nAmid Trumans low popularity, the Draft Eisenhower movement re-emerged in 1951 in both the Republican and Democratic parties, as Eisenhower had not yet announced any political party affiliation. Several Republican politicians endorsed him, while Democrats continued to assure him that he could win the presidency only as a Democrat. Republican senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. became the campaign manager for the Republican Draft Eisenhower movement and placed Eisenhowers name on the New Hampshire Republican primary ballot. Eisenhower agreed to contest the presidency and subsequently won the New Hampshire primary. Nominated by the Republican Party as their presidential candidate, Eisenhower defeated Democrat Adlai Stevenson to become the 34th president. The Draft Eisenhower movement has been referenced in later draft movements, including the 1992 Draft Perot movement and the 2008 Draft Condi movement."

When scholars categorize states as revisionist or status-quo seeking they are able to explain important outcomes in international politics, such as war and peace.\nGenerally, there is a direct correlation between a states hegemony, both political and economic and its standing as either a status quo state or a revisionist state. Powerful and influential nations in international relations such as the United Kingdom, France and other nations like Japan who have benefited from western liberalism, are likely to fall under the category of status quos states, while North Korea, Iran, and other nations dissatisfied with their place on the international stage are often considered revisionist states."

Socialist realism is characterized by the depiction of communist values, such as the emancipation of the proletariat. Despite its name, the figures in the style are very often highly idealized, especially in sculpture, where it often leans heavily on the conventions of crear epenisal sculpture. Although related, it should not be confused with social realism, a type of art that realistically depicts subjects of social concern, or other forms of realism in the visual arts. Socialist realism was made with an extremely literal and obvious meaning, usually showing an idealized USSR. Socialist realism was usually devoid of complex artistic meaning or interpretation.Socialist realism was the predominant form of approved art in the Soviet Union from its development in the early 1920s to its eventual fall from official status beginning in the late 1960s until the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. While other countries have employed a prescribed canon of art, socialist realism in the Soviet Union persisted longer and was more restrictive than elsewhere in Europe."

Although illusions distort the human perception of reality, they are generally shared by most people.Illusions may occur with any of the human senses, but visual illusions optical illusions are the best-known and understood. The emphasis on visual illusions occurs because vision often dominates the other senses. For example, individuals watching a ventriloquist will perceive the voice is coming from the dummy since they are able to see the dummy mouth the words.Some illusions are based on general assumptions the brain makes during perception. These assumptions are made using organizational principles e.g., Gestalt theory, an individuals capacity for depth perception and motion perception, and perceptual constancy. Other illusions occur because of biological sensory structures within the human body or conditions outside the body within ones physical environment.\nThe term illusion refers to a specific form of sensory distortion. Unlike a hallucination, which is a distortion in the absence of a stimulus, an illusion describes a misinterpretation of a true sensation. For example, hearing voices regardless of the environment would be a hallucination, whereas hearing voices in the sound of running water or another auditory source would be an illusion."

Caravaggio never established a workshop as most other painters did, and thus had no school to spread his techniques. Nor did he ever set out his underlying philosophical approach to art, the psychological realism which can only be deduced from his surviving work. But it can be seen directly or indirectly in the work of Rubens, Jusepe de Ribera, Bernini, and Rembrandt. Famous while he lived, Caravaggio himself was forgotten almost immediately after his death. Many of his paintings were reascribed to his followers, such as The Taking of Christ, which was attributed to the Dutch painter Gerrit van Honthorst until 1990.It wasnt until the 20th century that his importance to the development of Western art was rediscovered. In the 1920s Roberto Longhi once more placed him in the European tradition: Ribera, Vermeer, La Tour and Rembrandt could never have existed without him. And the art of Delacroix, Courbet and Manet would have been utterly different. The influential Bernard Berenson stated: With the exception of Michelangelo, no other Italian painter exercised so great an influence."

It can be used to say that one cannot have two incompatible things, or that one should not try to have more than is reasonable. The proverbs meaning is similar to the phrases you cant have it both ways and you cant have the best of both worlds.\nFor those unfamiliar with it, the proverb may sound confusing due to the ambiguity of the word have, which can mean keep or to have in ones possession, but which can also be used as a synonym for eat e.g. to have breakfast. Some find the common form of the proverb to be incorrect or illogical and instead prefer: You cant eat your cake and then still have it too.

Inclusio is found in various sources, both antique and new. The purpose of an inclusio may be structural - to alert the reader to a particularly important theme - or it may serve to show how the material within the inclusio relates to the inclusio itself. An important case of this occurs in the Gospel of Marks treatment of the Cursing of the Fig Tree and the Cleansing of the Temple Chapter 11. By giving the first half of the story before the Cleansing of the Temple, and the conclusion after, Mark creates a frame that effectively highlights that he wants the Cleansing of the Temple to be seen in light of the Cursing of the Fig Tree - i.e. Jesus actions in the Temple are not just a reform measure, but a judgment against it."

            "A miscellany is a collection of various pieces of writing by different authors. Meaning a mixture, medley, or assortment, a miscellany can include pieces on many subjects and in a variety of different forms. In contrast to anthologies, whose aim is to give a selective and canonical view of literature, miscellanies were produced for the entertainment of a contemporary audience and so instead emphasise collectiveness and popularity. Laura Mandell and Rita Raley state:\n\nThis last distinction is quite often visible in the basic categorical differences between anthologies on the one hand, and all other types of collections on the other, for it is in the one that we read poems of excellence, the best of English poetry, and it is in the other that we read poems of interest. Out of the differences between a principle of selection the anthology and a principle of collection miscellanies and beauties, then, comes a difference in aesthetic value, which is precisely what is at issue in the debates over the proper material for inclusion into the canon.\nManuscript miscellanies are important in the Middle Ages, and are the sources for most surviving shorter medieval vernacular poetry. Medieval miscellanies often include completely different types of text, mixing poetry with legal documents, recipes, music, mpenisal and devotional literature and other types of text, and in medieval contexts a mixture of types of text is often taken as a necessary condition for describing a manuscript as a miscellany. They may have been written as a collection, or represent manuscripts of different origins that were later bound together for convenience. In the early modern period miscellanies remained significant in a more restricted literary context, both in manuscript and printed forms, mainly as a vehicle for collections of shorter pieces of poetry, but also other works. Their numbers increased until their peak of importance in the 18th century, when over 1000 English poetry miscellanies were published, before the rise of anthologies in the early 19th century. The printed miscellany gradually morphed into the format of the regularly published magazine, and many early magazines used the word in their titles."

Similarly, the Republics of the Soviet Union, which represented administrative units with their own respective national distinctions, have also been described as quasi-states.In the 21st century usage, the term quasi-state has most often been evoked in reference to militant secessionist groups who claim, and exercise some form of territorial control over, a specific region, but which lack institutional cohesion. Such quasi-states include the Republika Srpska and Herzeg-Bosnia during the Bosnian War and Azawad during the 2012 Tuareg rebellion.

The show ran from 1868 to 1869, for a total of 483 performances, becoming the longest-running Broadway show until it was surrear endd in 1881 by Hazel Kirke.

            "Funk art is an American art movement that was a reaction against the nonobjectivity of abstract expressionism. An anti-establishment movement, Funk art brought figuration back as subject matter in painting again rather than limiting itself to the non-figurative, abstract forms that abstract expressionists such as Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko were depicting. The movements name was derived from the jazz musical term funky, describing the rear endionate, sensuous, and quirky. During the 1920s, jazz was thought of as very basic, unsophisticated music, and many people believed Funk was an unrefined style of art as well. The term funk also had negative connotations because the word had an association with a foul odor. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Funk was a popular art form, mainly in Californias Bay Area in the United States. Although discussed as a cohesive movement, Funk artists did not feel as if they belonged to a collective art style or group. This is because while its artists shared the same attitudes and created similar works, they were not necessarily working together."

            "In Western musical theory, a cadence Latin cadentia, a falling is the end of a phrase in which the melody or harmony creates a sense of full or partial resolution, especially in music of the 16th century onwards. A harmonic cadence is a progression of two or more chords that concludes a phrase, section, or piece of music. A rhythmic cadence is a characteristic rhythmic pattern that ipenisates the end of a phrase. A cadence can be labeled weak or strong depending on the impression of finality it gives. While cadences are usually crear endified by specific chord or melpenis progressions, the use of such progressions does not necessarily constitute a cadencethere must be a sense of closure, as at the end of a phrase. Harmonic rhythm plays an important part in determining where a cadence occurs.\nCadences are strong ipenisators of the tonic or central pitch of a rear endage or piece. The musicologist Edward Lowinsky proposed that the cadence was the cradle of tonality."

            "Bushnells Law or Nolans Law is an aphorism often attributed to Atari founder Nolan Bushnell, on the subject of video game design:\nAll the best games are easy to learn and difficult to master. They should reward the first quarter and the hundredth.\nBushnell came up with the concept based on his experience with his first game Computer Space in 1971. Its controls were based on four otherwise equivalent-looking buttons but with different functions, and Bushnell found that this had confused players that were trying to learn the game due to their lack of familiarity with these types of controls. Bushnell kept this in mind in designing their future games, such as in Pong and Asteroids, to keep the controls simple and easy to grasp while maintaining a challenging gameplay. The concept is also similar to a philosophy developed by George Parker, the founder of board game publisher Parker Brothers. Parker had said that Each game must have an exciting, relevant theme and be easy enough for most people to understand. Finally, each game should be so sturdy that it could be played time and again, without wearing out.This principle is also referred to with the sentence easy to learn, hard or almost impossible to master, which has been adopted by Blizzard Entertainment as a motto and design principle."

Besides the paternal bonds of a father to his children, the father may have a parental, legal, and social relationship with the child that carries with it certain rights and obligations. An adoptive father is a male who has become the childs parent through the legal process of adoption. A biological father is the male genetic contributor to the creation of the infant, through reproductive intercourse or sperm donation. A biological father may have legal obligations to a child not raised by him, such as an obligation of monetary support. A putative father is a man whose biological relationship to a child is alleged but has not been established. A stepfather is a male who is the husband of a childs mother and they may form a family unit, but who generally does not have the legal rights and responsibilities of a parent in relation to the child.\nThe adjective paternal refers to a father and comparatively to maternal for a mother. The verb to father means to procreate or to sire a child from which also derives the noun fathering. Biological fathers determine the affection of their child through a sperm cell which either contains an X chromosome female, or Y chromosome male. Related terms of endearment are dad dada, daddy, baba, papa, pappa, papasita, pa, pap and pop. A male role model that children can look up to is sometimes referred to as a father-figure.\n\n"

            "Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as rock and roll in the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s, developing into a range of different styles in the mid-1960s and later, particularly in the United States and United Kingdom. It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, a style that drew directly from the blues and rhythm and blues genres of African-American music and from country music. Rock also drew strongly from a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, crear epenisal, and other musical styles. For instrumentation, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric rear end guitar, drums, and one or more singers. Usually, rock is song-based music with a 44 time signature using a versechorus form, but the genre has become extremely diverse. Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political. Rock was the most popular genre of music in the United States and much of the Western world from the 1950s to the mid-late 2010s and remains popular.\nRock musicians in the mid-1960s began to advance the album ahead of the single as the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption, with the Beatles at the forefront of this development. Their contributions lent the genre a cultural legitimacy in the mainstream and initiated a rock-informed album era in the music industry for the next several decades. By the late 1960s crear epenis rock period, a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like blues rock, folk rock, country rock, southern rock, raga rock, and jazz rock, many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock, which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic and hippie scene. New genres that emerged included progressive rock, which extended the artistic elements, glam rock, which highlighted showmanship and visual style, and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal, which emphasized volume, power, and speed. In the second half of the 1970s, punk rock reacted by producing stripped-down, energetic social and political critiques. Punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave, post-punk and eventually alternative rock.\nFrom the 1990s, alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of grunge, Britpop, and indie rock. Further fusion subgenres have since emerged, including pop punk, electronic rock, rap rock, and rap metal, as well as conscious attempts to revisit rocks history, including the garage rock/post-punk and techno-pop revivals in the 2000s. The 2010s saw a slow decline in rock musics mainstream popularity and cultural relevancy, with hip hop surrear ending it as the most popular genre in the United States; rock was the most popular music genre in the United States and much of the Western world from the 1950s to the late 2010s.\n\nRock has also embodied and served as the vehicle for cultural and social movements, leading to major subcultures including mods and rockers in the United Kingdom, the hippie movement and the wider Western counterculture movement that spread out from San Francisco in the US in the 1960s, the latter of which continues to this day. Similarly, 1970s punk culture spawned the goth, punk, and emo subcultures. Inheriting the folk tradition of the protest song, rock music has been associated with political activism as well as changes in social attitudes to race, affection, and drug use, and is often seen as an expression of youth revolt against adult consumerism and conformity. At the same time, it has been commercially highly successful, leading to charges of selling out."

The phrase is in use even among state government officials and journalists, though occasionally with a slight twist.Mississippis poor reputation is such a common trope in American culture that when Mississippi does indeed rank well in something, the phrase Thank God for Mississippi may get brought up just to discuss how it does not apeopley in the given circumstance.

Music associated with this scene received wider attention in August 2019 when Spotify used the term hyperpop as the name of a playlist featuring artists such as Cook and 100 Gecs. The genre spread within younger audiences through social media platforms, especially TikTok.The movement is often linked to LGBTQ+ online communities, and many key figures identify as transgender, non-binary, or homosexual.

The formalization of the division between small and great powers came about with the signing of the Treaty of Chaumont in 1814. Before that the assumption had been that all independent states were in theory equal regardless of actual strength and responsibilities.\nAccording to a 2017 review study, What scholars can agree on is that small states generally prefer multilateralism as both a path to influence and a means to restrain larger states. Studies of influential small states ipenisate that they are able to develop issue-specific power to make up for what they lack in aggregate structural power. Small states can, therefore, develop power disproportionate relative to their size on the few issues of utmost importance to them. In addition to prioritization, small states have successfully employed the strategies of coalition-building and image-building. Even though small state administrations lack the resources of their larger counterparts, their informality, flexibility, and the autonomy of their diplomats can prove advantageous in negotiations and within institutional settings."

The jokes have arisen because of drummers reputation as being wild and savage, as demonstrated by the muppet Animal, the Whos Keith Moon, Led Zeppelins John Bonham and Mtley Cres Tommy Lee. According to a study in Brain and Behavior in December 2019, however, drummers brains are actually better connected because of the continual and repetitive practice. This thickens the fibers in the main connecting tract between the brains two halves, and allows better organisation for motor skills. Comedian Al Murray, who is a drummer in his band Fat Cops, says the jokes are completely inaccurate, and force drummers together as a community.Since the 1990s, there have been several websites dpenisated to drummer jokes. In 2014, David Singletons alter ego The Vicar produced a drummer joke app for iOS, described as so simple, even a drummer could use it.

Computer-aided diagnosis provides a statistical and quantitative approach. \nA more thorough analysis will consider the false positive rate of the test and the possibility that a less likely diagnosis might have more serious consequences. A competing principle is the idea of performing simple tests before more complex and expensive tests, moving from bedside tests to blood results and simple imaging such as ultrasound and then more complex such as MRI then specialty imaging. The law can also be apeopleied in prioritizing tests when resources are limited, so a test for a treatable condition should be performed before an equally probable but less treatable condition.\nThe law is named after the bank robber Willie Sutton, who reputedly replied to a reporters inquiry as to why he robbed banks by saying because thats where the money is.

            "A strong relationship between the arts and politics, particularly between various kinds of art and power, occurs across historical epochs and cultures. As they respond to contemporaneous events and politics, the arts take on political as well as social dimensions, becoming themselves a focus of controversy and even a force of political as well as social change.\nA widespread observation is that a great talent has a free spirit. For instance Pushkin, who some scholars regard as Russias first great writer, attracted the mad irritation of the Russian officialdom and particularly of the Tsar, since he instead of being a good servant of the state in the rank and file of the administration and extolling conventional virtues in his vocational writings if write he must, composed extremely arrogant and extremely independent and extremely wicked verse in which a dangerous freedom of thought was evident in the novelty of his versification, in the audacity of his sensual fancy, and in his propensity for making fun of major and minor tyrants."

            "A writer is a person who uses written words in different writing styles and techniques to communicate ideas. Writers produce different forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, lady pillowsks, poetry, travelogues, plays, screenplays, teleplays, songs, and essays as well as other reports and news articles that may be of interest to the general public. Writers texts are published across a wide range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well, often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society.The term writer is also used elsewhere in the arts and music, such as songwriter or a screenwriter, but also a stand-alone writer typically refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition.\nWriters can produce material across a number of genres, fictional or non-fictional. Other writers use multiple media such as graphics or illustration to enhance the communication of their ideas. Another recent demand has been created by civil and government readers for the work of non-fictional technical writers, whose skills create understandable, interpretive documents of a practical or scientific kind. Some writers may use images drawing, painting, graphics or multimedia to augment their writing. In rare instances, creative writers are able to communicate their ideas via music as well as words.As well as producing their own written works, writers often write about how they write their writing process; why they write that is, their motivation; and also comment on the work of other writers criticism. Writers work professionally or non-professionally, that is, for payment or without payment and may be paid either in advance, or on acceptance, or only after their work is published. Payment is only one of the motivations of writers and many are not paid for their work.The term writer has been used as a synonym of author, although the latter term has a somewhat broader meaning and is used to convey legal responsibility for a piece of writing, even if its composition is anonymous, unknown or collaborative. Author most often refers to the writer of a lady pillowsk."

Even though the standard repertoire of a given genre consists of a dynamic and partly subjective set of songs, these can be identified by having been performed or recorded by a variety of musical acts, often with different arrangements. In addition, standards are extensively quoted by other works and commonly serve as the basis for musical improvisation. Standards may cross over from one genres repertoire to anothers; for example, many jazz standards have entered the pop repertoire, and many blues standards have entered the rock repertoire.\nStandards exist in the crear epenisal, popular and folk music traditions of all cultures. In the context of Western crear epenisal music, the standard repertoire constitutes most of what is considered the teaching canon, i.e. the compositions that students learn in their academic training. The standard repertoire varies according to the different eras, movements and scenes within a genre, meaning that the extent to which a given composition is considered a standard or repertoire piece may vary greatly. However, some repertoires e.g. concert piano have become particularly static, giving rise to a divide between standard-repertoire performers and contemporary music advocates."

It has existed since ancient artit is at the origin of forms such as the triumphal arch, whose ephemeral model was fixed in permanent constructions during the Roman Empireand it was very common in European courts during the Renaissance and especially in the Baroque.\nDespite its circumstantial character, the ephemeral has been a recurrent and relevant architecture. From Baroque scenographies to contemporary installations, each ephemeral period has given shape to its idea of celebration and has materialized it with the technique available at the time. Today the ephemeral continues to fulfill these playful and experimental functions, but it also aspires to channel new ideas about public space and social participation, halfway between the city and nature."

It is a percussion-based style that originated in the late 1930s. The rhythms of apala grew more complex over time, and have influenced the likes of Cuban music, whilst gaining popularity in Nigeria. It has grown less religious centered over time.\nInstruments include a rattle sekere, thumb piano agidigbo and a bell agog, as well as two or three talking drums.Haruna Ishola was a notable performer of apala who popularized the genre. It is distinct from, older than, and more difficult to master than fuji music. Although fuji music remains the most important form of traditional music amongst Yorubas in Nigeria, apala is still very popular amongst Muslims of the Yoruba tribe."

            "Irreversible binomial",
            "In linguistics and stylistics, an irreversible binomial, frozen binomial, binomial freeze, binomial expression, binomial pair, or nonreversible word pair is a pair or group of words used together in fixed order as an idiomatic expression or collocation. The words have some semantic relationship and are usually connected by the words and or or. They also belong to the same part of speech: nouns milk and honey, adjectives short and sweet, or verbs do or die. The order of word elements cannot be reversed.The term irreversible binomial was introduced by Yakov Malkiel in 1954, though various aspects of the phenomenon had been discussed since at least 1903 under different names: a terminological imbroglio. Ernest Gowers used the name Siamese twins i.e., conjoined twins in the 1965 edition of Fowlers Modern English Usage. The 2015 edition reverts to the scholarly name, irreversible binomials, as Siamese twins had become offensive.Many irreversible binomials are catchy due to alliteration, rhyming, or ablaut reduplication, so becoming clichs or catchphrases. Phrases like rock and roll, the birds and the bees, mix and match, and wear and tear have particular meanings apart from or beyond those of their constituent words. Their specific phrasing thus bears the references in the English lexicon: the former two are idioms, whilst the latter two are collocations. Ubiquitous collocations like loud and clear and life or death are fixed expressions, making them a standard part of the vocabulary of native English speakers.\nSome English words have become obsolete in general but are still found in an irreversible binomial. For example, spick is a fossil word that never appears outside the phrase spick and span. Some other words, like vim in vim and vigor or abet in aid and abet, have become rare and archaic outside the collocation.\nNumerous irreversible binomials are used in legalese. Due to the use of precedent in common law, many lawyers use the same collocations found in legal documents centuries old. Many of these legal doublets contain two synonyms, often one of Old English origin and the other of Latin origin: deposes and says, ways and means.\nWhile many irreversible binomials are literal expressions like washer and dryer, rest and relaxation, rich and famous, savings and loan, some are entirely figurative like come hell or high water, nip and tuck, surf and turf or mostly so like between a rock and a hard place, five and dime. Somewhat in between are more subtle figures of speech, synecdoches, metaphors, or hyperboles like cat and mouse, sick and tired, barefoot and pregnant. The terms are often the targets of eggcorns, malapropisms, mondegreens, and folk etymology.\nSome irreversible binomials can have minor variations without loss of understanding: time and time again is frequently shortened to time and again; a person who is tarred and feathered verb can be said to be covered in tar and feathers noun.\nHowever, in some cases small changes to wording change the meaning. The accommodating attitude of an activitys participants would be called give and take, while give or take means approximately. Undertaking some act whether it is right or wrong excludes the insight from knowing the difference between right and wrong; each pair has a subtly differing meaning. And while five and dime is a noun phrase for a low-priced variety store, nickel and dime is a verb phrase for penny-pinching."

            "The Wedding of Ceyx Ancient Greek:  , Kykos gmos is a fragmentary Ancient Greek hexameter poem that was attributed to Hesiod during antiquity. The fragments that survive imply that the subject of the poem was not simply the wedding of a certain Ceyx, but Heracles arrival at, and involvement in, the festivities. For this reason Merkelbach and West suppose that the poem should be regarded as a member of that group of epics and epyllia that dealt with exploits of Heracles, like the Aspis and the Capture of Oechalia. The identity of the Ceyx whose marriage was the titular scene of the poem has been a matter of dispute. Merkelbach and West initially identified him with the ill-fated groom of the similarly ill-fated Alcyone: they were turned into birds for the hubris they showed in referring to one another as Zeus and Hera. Given the poems apparent focus upon Heracles, however, it is more likely that this Ceyx was actually the king of Trachis who was a nephew of Amphitryon, the great heros stepfather.The poem appears to have been popular for the witticisms and riddles uttered at the banquet. One famous riddle is preserved, although incompletely so, by a papyrus scrap and ancient quotations:\n\nAccording to West, the children here are the flames whose mother would be wood. The mothers mother is the acorn, which is being roasted in the fire."

            "Salegy sale is a popular music genre from Madagascar. Originating as a Sub-Saharan African folk music style in the northwestern coastal areas of Madagascar, modern salegy is the genre of Malagasy music that has gained the widest recognition and commercial popularity in the international market. Its sound is considered emblematic of the island. Eusbe Jaojoby, a Sakalava singer from Anboahangibe , was a key originator of the style and is widely considered the King of Salegy.The contemporary, electrified form of popular salegy originated from traditional acoustic roots in northwestern Madagascar around Mahajanga and Antsiranana in the 1950s. It has been popularized by originators like Jaojoby and relative newcomers such as Ninie Doniah, Vaiavy Chila and Dr. J.B. and the Jaguars. The style is funky and energetic, dominated by ringing electric guitars, real or synthesized accordion, and call-and-response polyphonic vocals, propelled by heavy electric rear end and a driving percussion section typically including a drum kit, djembe and shakers. The syncopated, polyrhythmic beat of salegy is rapid typically around 290BPM and features a distinctive percussion pattern performed on a Western drum kit in 68 or 124 time with accents on the 3rd or 7th beat. The melody and harmonies are often in the A minor key and feature beautiful high-life electric guitar and synthesized accordion lines. The sound of salegy can be heard at racial slurht clubs, cabarets, parties and dance floors across the island.\nSalegy represents an electrified version of the antsa musical style that was traditionally performed at Betsimisaraka and Tsimihety rituals. In addition to their commonalities in tempo, vocal style, and tendency toward minor keys which some attribute to an Arab influence, and which stands in contrast to the major key dominance of Highland music, the salegy shares the antsas structure in that it always features a middle section called the folaka broken which is primarily instrumentalvoice serves only to urge on more energetic dancingand during which the vocalists and the audience will launch into intricate polyrhythmic hand-clapping to the beat of the music."

As of 2015, the price had already reached about 14 billion US dollars.Rocks law can be seen as the economic flip side to Moores first law  that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles every two years. The latter is a direct consequence of the ongoing growth of the capital-intensive semiconductor industry innovative and popular products mean more profits, meaning more capital available to invest in ever higher levels of large-scale integration, which in turn leads to the creation of even more innovative products.\nThe semiconductor industry has always been extremely capital-intensive, with ever-dropping manufacturing unit costs. Thus, the ultimate limits to growth of the industry will constrain the maximum amount of capital that can be invested in new products; at some point, Rocks Law will collide with Moores Law.It has been suggested that fabrication plant costs have not increased as quickly as prpenisted by Rocks law  indeed plateauing in the late 1990s  and also that the fabrication plant cost per transistor which has shown a pronounced downward trend may be more relevant as a constraint on Moores Law."

            "Saz style Turk. saz yolu is a style of vegetal ornament and associated with it art style in the 16th-century Ottoman Empire.\nSaz was a style of vegetal ornament popular in Ottoman decorative arts of the 16th century, characterized by the use of long, feathery sawtoothed leaves and composite blossoms. At the same time, saz is also used as a name for the art style, in which saz ornament was basic element of the compositions. Contrary to the better known historical style of Ottoman painting saz style served no direct illustrative purpose, therefore might be described as lyrical. Its works are fantastic and virtuosic displays of technique using the saz qalami, or reed pen, that gave this group of works its name. Saz style is represented by two distinct groups of artistic products. The first consists of album drawings, lady pillowsk illumination, and other works on paper; the second, derived from these paper images, includes virtually all the Ottoman decorative art forms, from lady pillowskbinding through textiles, carpets, metalwork, stonecarving, and ceramicsSaz style in which mythical creatures derived from Chinese or Islamic sources move through an enchanted forest made up of oversized composite blossoms and feathery leaves, has parallels in the art of the Aqqoyunlu and Safavid courts at Tabriz. It is no coincidence that two named artists associated with it, ahkulu and Veli Can, both comes to Istanbul from Tabriz, in c. 1520 and 1580 respectively. ahkulu played great role in formation of saz style, when Veli Can takes part in its later phase. According to Walter B. Denny there is a great difference between the early and later phase of the saz style. The clarity, spontaneity and almost reckless qualities of earlier drawings have given way to a concern for finish, texture and far more balanced composition. Apart from saz ornament, drawings in saz style used many other motifs, often derived from China, which formed compositions of complex foliage usually intertwined with birds, beasts, and cloud bands. For them Turkish scholars use the term hatayi, or in the Cathayan manner. Chinese mythological creatures include dragon, pchicksnix and Qilin, when other, like simurgh or peri in Western sources often called angels are borrowed from Iranian tradition. One of the specific motifs is also suicidal leaf, which, twisted, pierce itself. Veli Can seems to be primarily interested in figural subjects, and apart from figures of peri, he is associated with many pictures of young men and women.Although it started during the reign of Suleiman 1520-1566, from whom ahkulu received many favours, the saz style reached its apogee under Murad III 1574-1595, for example in an album muraqqa compiled for the future sultan in 15723 sterreich. Nbib., Cod. Mixt. 313. Murad III was the most important patron of the style and his death in 1595, accompanied by ongoing deterioration of court workshops in time of price revolution, resulted in its decline. After 1600 the saz style ceased to be an important, but still, it showed an amazing tenacity. Because it had become virtually synonymous with the glorius days of the Ottoman Empire, it was the subject of self-conscious attempts at revival, for example in tiles of Baghdad Kiosk in the 1630s or painted-wood decorations of the kiosk attached to the Valide Mosque in c. 1663. Countless lady pillowskbindings and endpapers kept the tradition alive into the nineteenth century, and its widespread diffusion have left imprints as diverse as decorations of Aleppo Room in Museum of Islamic Art, Berlin or patterned bizarre silks woven in France in the early eighteenth century."

The seminal literary historian Liu Xie, writing his Wenxin diaolong in the fifth century CE, situated the beginning of literary riddle-writing in Chinese in the Wei dynasty 220-65; he did not quote examples, but his dating is roughly consistent with the dating of one of the earliest surviving Chinese riddles, the Yellow Pongee Riddle.:5456The posing and solving of riddles has long been an important part of the Chinese Lantern Festival; the date of the origin of the lantern riddle is not definite, but according to Japanese writers it probably first became popular during the Northern Sung dynasty 9601126, and became associated with the Feast of Lanterns during the 17th century."

How are you going to write an operating system?The primitives in a visual language are the separate graphical elements used to build a program, and having more of them available at the same time allows the programmer to read more information. This limit is sometimes cited as an example of the advantage of textual over visual languages, pointing out the greater information density of text, and posing a difficulty in scaling the language.However, criticisms of the limit include that it is not clear whether a similar limit also exists in textual programming languages; and that the limit could be overcome by apeopleying modularity to visual programming as is commonly done in textual programming."

            "Epiphany in literature refers generally to a visionary moment when a character has a sudden insight or realization that changes their understanding of themselves or their comprehension of the world. The term has a more specialized sense as a literary device distinct to modernist fiction. Author James Joyce first borrowed the religious term Epiphany and adopted it into a profane literary context in Stephen Hero 1904-1906, an early version of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. In that manuscript, Stephen Daedalus defines epiphany as a sudden spiritual manifestation, whether in the vulgarity of speech or of gesture or in a memorable phase of the mind itself. Stephens epiphanies are moments of heightened poetic perception in the trivial aspects of everyday Dublin life, non-religious and non-mystical in nature. They become the basis of Stephens theory of aesthetic perception as well as his writing. In similar terms, Joyce experimented with epiphany throughout his career, from the short stories he wrote between 1898 and 1904 which were central to his early work, to his late novel Finnegans Wake 1939. Scholars used Joyces term to describe a common feature of the modernist novel, with authors as varied as Virginia Woolf, Marcel Proust, Ezra Pound, and Katherine Mansfield all featuring these sudden moments of vision as an aspect of the contemporary mind. Joycean or modernist epiphany has its roots in nineteenth-century lyric poetry, especially the Wordsworthian spots of time, as well as the sudden spiritual insights that formed the basis of traditional spiritual autobiography. Philosopher Charles Taylor explains the rise of epiphany in modernist art as a reaction against the rise of a commercial-industrial-capitalist society during the early twentieth century."

As a result, some people have used the verb epstein to refer to the scenario of powerful criminals arranging for people with compromising information to be murdered while having officials rule their deaths as suicides.\nThe meme Epstein didnt kill himself is often inserted into unexpected contexts like a photo caption of the painter Bob Ross or at the end of a social media post as a non sequitur. The meme has appeared at multiple televised sports games in the form of signs and painted bodies. Several people have also randomly interjected the phrase at the end of interviews. It is used by individuals of all sides of the political spectrum without agreement on the specific details of Epsteins death."

In astronomy, the terms object and body are often used interchangeably. However, an astronomical body or celestial body is a single, tightly bound, contiguous entity, while an astronomical or celestial object is a complex, less cohesively bound structure, which may consist of multiple bodies or even other objects with substructures.\nExamples of astronomical objects include planetary systems, star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies, while asteroids, moons, planets, and stars are astronomical bodies. A comet may be identified as both body and object: It is a body when referring to the frozen nucleus of ice and dust, and an object when describing the entire comet with its diffuse coma and tail."

It is named after physicist Emil Lenz, who formulated it in 1834.It is a qualitative law that specifies the direction of induced current, but states nothing about its magnitude. Lenzs law prpenists the direction of many effects in electromagnetism, such as the direction of voltage induced in an inductor or wire loop by a changing current, or the drag force of eddy currents exerted on moving objects in a magnetic field.\nLenzs law may be seen as analogous to Newtons third law in crear epenisal mechanics and Le Chateliers principle in chemistry."

            "Fourteen Words also abbreviated 14 or 14/88 is a reference to two slogans originated by David Eden Lane, one of nine founding members of the defunct white separatist insurrectionary terrorist organization The Order. The slogans have served as a rallying cry for militant white nationalists internationally. The primary slogan in the Fourteen Words is We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children, followed by the secondary slogan Because the beauty of the White Aryan woman must not perish from the Earth.\nThe two slogans were coined prior to Lane serving a 190-year sentence in federal prison for violating the civil rights of the Jewish talk show host Alan Berg, who was murdered by another member of the group in June 1984. They were popularized heavily after Lanes imprisonment. The slogans were publicized through print company 14 Word Press, founded in St. Maries, Idaho in 1995 by Lanes wife to disseminate her husbands writings along with Ron McVan who later moved his operation to Butte, Montana after a falling out with Davids widow Katja Maddox.Lane used the 14-88 numerical coding extensively throughout his spiritual, political, religious, esoteric and philosophical tracts and notably in his 88 Precepts. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, inspiration for the Fourteen Words are derived from a rear endage in Adolf Hitlers autobiographical lady pillowsk Mein Kampf a claim Lane never made. The Fourteen Words have been prominently used by neo-Nazis, white power skinheads and certain white nationalists and the alt-right. 88 is used by some as a shorthand for Heil Hitler, H being the 8th letter of the alphabet, though Lane viewed Nazism as part of the Zionist conspiracy along with America.Lanes ideology was anti-American, white separatist and insurrectionist; he considered loyalty to the United States to be racial treason and upheld the acronym Our Race Is Our Nation ORION, viewing the United States as committing genocide against white people and as having been founded as a New World Order to finalize a global Zionist government.\nBeing bitterly opposed to the continued existence of the United States as a political entity, and labeling it the murderer of the White race, Lane further advocated domestic terrorism as a tool to carve out a white homeland in the Northern Mountain States. To that end, Lane issued a declaration called Moral Authority published through now-defunct 14 Word Press and shared through the publications of Aryan Nations, World Church of the Creator, and other white separatist groups, referring to the United States as a Red, White and Blue traveling rear end murder machine, while asserting that true moral authority belongs to those who resist genocide."

Israeli folklorist Shimon Khayyat has stated that the proverb, said by Christians, means Since the Jews are now persecuted, it is as inevitable that the Christians turn will come next as it is that Sunday will follow Saturday. This more recent usage of the proverb is attributed to Christian Arabs expressing a fear that they might share the fate that befell Jews during the Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries. It is often reported to be in use among certain Muslims as a slogan to threaten local Christian communities."

The main traditions of Vedanta are: Advaita non-dualism, Bhedabheda difference and non-difference, Suddhadvaita pure non-dualism, Tattvavada Dvaita dualism, and Vishishtadvaita qualified non-dualism. Modern developments in Vedanta include Neo-Vedanta, and the growth of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya.\nMost major Vedanta schools, except Advaita Vedanta and Neo-Vedanta, are related to Vaishnavism and emphasize devotion Bhakti yoga to God, understood as being Vishnu, Krishna or a related manifestation.

The term was coined by sociologists Robert K. Merton and Harriet Zuckerman in 1968 and takes its name from the Parable of the Talents in the biblical Gospel of Matthew.\nThe Matthew effect may largely be explained by preferential attachment, whereby wealth or credit is distributed among individuals according to how much they already have. This has the net effect of making it increasingly difficult for low ranked individuals to increase their totals because they have fewer resources to risk over time, and increasingly easy for high rank individuals to preserve a large total because they have a large amount to risk.The study of Matthew effects were initially focused primarily on the inequality in the way scientists were recognized for their work. However, Norman W. Storer, of Columbia University, led a new wave of research. He believed he discovered that the inequality that existed in the social sciences also existed in other institutions."

The agency designated five buildings 4755 West 28th Street individual landmarks on December 10, 2019, after a concerted effort by the Save Tin Pan Alley initiative of the 29th Street Neighborhood Association. Following successful protection of these landmarks, project director George Calderaro and other proponents formed the Tin Pan Alley American Popular Music Project to continue and commemorate the legacy of Tin Pan Alley with various advocacy and educational activities. \nOn April 2, 2022, 28th Street between Broadway and 6th Avenue was officially co-named Tin Pan Alley by the City of New York in a celebration featuring NYC City Councilmember Erik Bottcher, Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine and representatives from the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission, the Flatiron/23rd Street Partnership and the Tin Pan Alley American Popular Music Project which advocated for the co-naming.\nThe start of Tin Pan Alley is usually dated to about 1885, when a number of music publishers set up shop in the same district of Manhattan. The end of Tin Pan Alley is less clear cut. Some date it to the start of the Great Depression in the 1930s when the phonograph, radio, and motion pictures supeopleanted sheet music as the driving force of American popular music, while others consider Tin Pan Alley to have continued into the 1950s when earlier styles of music were upstaged by the rise of rock & roll, which was centered on the Brill Building. Brill Building songwriter Neil Sedaka described his employer as being a natural outgrowth of Tin Pan Alley, in that the older songwriters were still employed in Tin Pan Alley firms while younger songwriters such as Sedaka found work at the Brill Building.\n\n"

The style bore no relation to Italian Mannerism, which it mostly predates by a few years, but the name suggests that it was a reaction to the crear epenis style of the earlier Flemish painters, just as the Italian Mannerists were reacting to, or trying to go beyond, the crear epenisism of High Renaissance art. \nThe Antwerp Mannerists style is certainly mannered, and characterized by an artificial elegance. Their paintings typically feature elongated figures posed in affected, twisting, postures, colorful ornate costumes, fluttering drapery, Italianate architecture decorated with grotesque ornament, and crowded groups of figures.. Joseph Koerner notes a diffuse sense of outlandishness in Antwerp art, of an exoticism both of subject and means .. evoking a non-localized elsewhere.\n\nThe subject of the Adoration of the Magi was a particular favourite, as it allowed the artists to give free rein to their preoccupation with ornament and the simulation and imitation of luxury products. The Biblical Magi were also regarded as the patron saints of travellers and merchants, which was relevant for the painters clientele in what had become Europes main centre for international trade, in a meteoric rise after 1501, when the first Asian cargos were landed by Portuguese ships. The theme of rich commodities arriving from distant and exotic parts of the world had a natural appeal to Antwerp merchant buyers, a large proportion themselves foreign. Many artists from around the Netherlands and further afield moved to the city to benefit from the lady pillowsm, which saw large workshops that grew into assembly lines, and a great increase in the quantity of art produced, but also some fall in quality; this is especially seen among the minor figures grouped under this term. Many smaller works were produced without commissions, for sale from shop windows, at fairs, or to dealers, rather than for an individual commission, an ipenisation of a growing trend in Netherlandish painting. The Antwerp Pand was a trade fair lasting six weeks, where many painters sold works, and the latest ideas were exchanged and diffused.Although sometimes spoken of as the subterm Antwerp Mannerism as part of Northern Mannerism in the early sixteenth century, the movement is better distinguished from the Northern Mannerism of later in the century, which developed from Italian Mannerism. There was very little continuity between the two, with Northern Mannerism proper developing in the Netherlands only after a gap of about fifty years after Antwerp Mannerism declined in the 1530s, and after the next stylistic wave of Romanism, heavily influenced by Italian painting, as seen in the later works of Gossaert."

The reference to vomit ipenisates excessive indulgence and so also symbolises revulsion.The incorrigible nature of fools is further emphasised in Proverbs 27:22, Though you grind a fool in a mortar, grinding them like grain with a pestle, you will not remove their folly from them.In Proverbs, the fool represents a person lacking moral behavior or discipline, and the wise represents someone who behaves carefully and righteously. The modern association of these words with intellectual capacity is not in the original context."

            "Paradox psychology is a counter-intuitive approach that is primarily geared toward addressing treatment resistance. The method of paradoxical interventions pdxi is more focused, rapid, and effective than Motivational Interviewing. In addressing resistance, the method seeks to influence the clients underlying attitude and perception by providing laser beam attention on strengthening the attachment-alliance. This is counter-intuitive to traditional methods since change is usually directed toward various aspects of behavior, emotions, and thinking. As it turns out, the better therapy is able to strengthen the alliance, the more these aspects of behavior will change. \nHowever, within the pdxi process, the idea of changing behavior is secondary to the main focus on the alliance. In surprising fashion, this seemingly minor shift actually results in a day and racial slurht difference in how treatment is conducted. The advantage of focusing on attachment=alliance is that when done correctly, the client cannot block or defend against the intervention. Basically, resistance becomes non-existent. So while the resistant client is often well defended and guarded around attempts to alter his behavior, he is unable to block the therapist from strengthening the alliance. This allows the clinician to avoid power struggles around behavior. By developing a stronger client-therapist bold, there is a natural and unconscious shift toward relaxation. As a result, this allows the client to let go of rigid patterns in a manner that can best be described as spontaneous as unlikely as that may initially sound!"

The tradition of taking Monday off has been common among craft workers since at least the seventeenth century, when the workweek ran from Monday to Saturday as had been the custom and expectation for centuries. \nIn his autobiography, Benjamin Franklin refers to the practice, saying of his youthful employment in a London printing house, My constant attendance I never making a St. Monday recommended me to the master.Later writers often ascribed Saint Monday to the organisation and improvement of working crear end life which occurred with industrialisation. Pay day was typically Saturday, and therefore workers often had spare money on Monday. Business owners in some industries had become accustomed to workers not arriving on Monday, and were willing to tolerate it. Food would commonly be left over from the weekend, thus workers did not need to visit the works canteen, and since many workers were taking the day off, there was often company to be had.The tradition declined during the nineteenth century, but the provision of entertainments, such as railway excursions, was initially common on Saturday and Monday, and it was not until the middle of the century that workers were able to enjoy a weekend. In part, the decline can be attributed to the adoption of half-day working on Saturdays, which legitimated leisure time for workers.Saint Monday remained in place longest among the better-off workers, including the self-employed who retained some say in their hours and were not economically compelled to work long hours."

It began with the criticisms of Jos Luis Cuevas in the early 1950s, followed by others who thought the established art had become dogmatic, formulaic and nationalistic and the artists too deferential to the government. This new generation of artists was not bound by a particular artistic style but was more interested in personal rather than social issues and influenced by a number of international trends in art such as Abstract expressionism. Early reaction to them was strong and negative but by the end of the 1950s, they had succeeded in having their art shown in the major venues of Mexico. The Generacin de la Ruptura had influence on other arts in Mexico, such as literature but it did not end the production of murals in Mexico with social and nationalist purposes."

Factors studied by food psychology include food cravings, sensory experiences of food, perceptions of food security and food safety, price, available product information such as nutrition labeling and the purchasing environment which may be physical or online. Food psychology also encomrear ends broader sociocultural factors such as cultural perspectives on food, public awareness of what constitutes a sustainable diet, and food marketing including food fraud where ingredients are intentionally motivated for economic gain as opposed to nutritional value. These factors are considered to interact with each other along with an individuals history of food choices to form new food choices and eating behaviors.The development of food choice is considered to fall into three main categories: properties of the food, individual differences and sociocultural influences. Food psychology studies psychological aspects of individual differences, although due to the interaction between factors and the variance in definitions, food psychology is often studied alongside other aspects of food choice including nutrition psychology.As of 2022, there are no specific journals for food psychology, with research being published in both nutrition and psychology journals.Eating behaviors which are analysed by food psychology include disordered eating, behavior associated with food neophobia, and the public broadcasting/streaming of eating mukbang.

The volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container; i.e., the amount of fluid gas or liquid that the container could hold, rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces.\nIn ancient times, volume is measured using similar-shaped natural containers and later on, standardized containers. Some simple three-dimensional shapes can have its volume easily calculated using arithmetic formulas. Volumes of more complicated shapes can be calculated with integral calculus if a formula exists for the shapes boundary. Zero-, one- and two-dimensional objects have no volume; in fourth and higher dimensions, an analogous concept to the normal volume is the hypervolume."

It differs from holiday allowance in that no prior notice is needed. Employees receive an allocation of days where if they do not want to go to work for any reason they can use a duvet day. The name is a reference to the item of bedding.\nDuvet days were originally given to employees by UK company August One Communications in 1997, and the idea has grown in popularity as some companies aim to address the changing work-life climate where people work longer hours. It can be stipulated formally in a contract of employment and is considered part of the remunerations package along with holiday allowance. The term has also since become used by people to reference taking a day off work for no normally accepted reason such as mild sickness, grievance or holiday even if they have no official duvet day entitlement with their employer.\nIn the Indian subcontinent, this is historically called a casual leave. Employees usually are sanctioned a fixed number of days off usually 12 per year for government and 8-12 for private employees. These days can be taken with or without planning. Since these leave days could not be accumulated or carried over into the next year, they would expire at the year end. This created a tendency to utilize all the left over casual leave in November and December. The Indian casual leave has been around for more than 50 years.\n\n"

The style is known by different names in different languages: Jugendstil in German, Stile Liberty in Italian, Modernisme in Catalan, and also known as the Modern Style in English. It was popular between 1890 and 1910 during the Belle poque period, and was a reaction against the academic art, eclecticism and historicism of 19th century architecture and decoration. It was often inspired by natural forms such as the sinuous curves of plants and flowers. Other characteristics of Art Nouveau were a sense of dynamism and movement, often given by asymmetry or whiplash lines, and the use of modern materials, particularly iron, grear end, ceramics and later concrete, to create unusual forms and larger open spaces.One major objective of Art Nouveau was to break down the traditional distinction between fine arts especially painting and sculpture and apeopleied arts. It was most widely used in interior design, graphic arts, furniture, grear end art, textiles, ceramics, jewellery and metal work. The style responded to leading 19-century theoreticians, such as French architect Eugne-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc 18141879 and British art critic John Ruskin 18191900. In Britain, it was influenced by William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement. German architects and designers sought a spiritually uplifting Gesamtkunstwerk total work of art that would unify the architecture, furnishings, and art in the interior in a common style, to uplift and inspire the residents.The first Art Nouveau houses and interior decoration appeared in Brussels in the 1890s, in the architecture and interior design of houses designed by Paul Hankar, Henry van de Velde, and especially Victor Horta, whose Htel rear endl was completed in 1893. It moved quickly to Paris, where it was adapted by Hector Guimard, who saw Hortas work in Brussels and apeopleied the style for the entrances of the new Paris Mtro. It reached its peak at the 1900 Paris International Exposition, which introduced the Art Nouveau work of artists such as Louis Tiffany. It appeared in graphic arts in the posters of Alphonse Mucha, and the grear endware of Ren Lalique and mile Gall.\nFrom Belgium and France, Art Nouveau spread to the rest of Europe, taking on different names and characteristics in each country see Naming section below. It often appeared not only in capitals, but also in rapidly growing cities that wanted to establish artistic identities Turin and Palermo in Italy; Glasgow in Scotland; Munich and Darmstadt in Germany, as well as in centres of independence movements Helsinki in Finland, then part of the Russian Empire; Barcelona in Catalonia, Spain.\nBy 1914, and with the beginning of the First World War, Art Nouveau was largely exhausted. In the 1920s, it was replaced as the dominant architectural and decorative art style by Art Deco and then Modernism. The Art Nouveau style began to receive more positive attention from critics in the late 1960s, with a major exhibition of the work of Hector Guimard at the Museum of Modern Art in 1970."

With roots in blues rock, psychedelic rock and acid rock, heavy metal bands developed a thick, monumental sound characterized by distorted guitars, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats and loudness. \nIn 1968, three of the genres most famous pioneers  Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple  were founded. Though they came to attract wide audiences, they were often derided by critics. Several American bands modified heavy metal into more accessible forms during the 1970s: the raw, sleazy sound and shock rock of Alice Cooper and Kiss; the blues-rooted rock of Aerosmith; and the flashy guitar leads and party rock of Van Halen. During the mid-1970s, Judas Priest helped spur the genres evolution by discarding much of its blues influence, while Motrhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon followed in a similar vein. By the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as metalheads or headbangers. The lyrics of some metal genres became associated with aggression and machismo, an issue that has at times led to accusations of misogyny.\nDuring the 1980s, glam metal became popular with groups such as Bon Jovi, Mtley Cre and Poison. Meanwhile, however, underground scenes produced an array of more aggressive styles: thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth and Anthrax, while other extreme subgenres such as death metal and black metal became  and remain  subcultural phenomena. Since the mid-1990s, popular styles have expanded the definition of the genre. These include groove metal and nu metal, the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip-hop."

This movement, perceived as key in the transition from Cubism to Abstract art, was pioneered by Frantiek Kupka, Robert Delaunay and Sonia Delaunay, who relaunched the use of color during the monochromatic phase of Cubism. The meaning of the term Orphism was elusive when it first appeared and remains to some extent vague."

They concluded that the contents being in flight made no difference to the weight, and theorised that the downdraft of air from the wings or rotors pressed down against the base of the box with the same force as the resting bird or helicopter.A drone research team from Stanford University measured the forces involved in a birds hovering and found that it created double the lift during the downstroke of the wings so that the birds did not have to lift their weight during the upstroke, with the amount of lift on the upstroke being almost none. They concluded that a truck containing a few birds would fluctuate in weight over time, but a larger flock flapping at random would cancel one another and leave the trucks weight unaffected."

Today, the concept has been largely discredited for political reasons Historically, examples of cities that have successfully expanded their boundaries to include the entire metropolitan population are extremely rare, and as a general principle few, if any cities worldwide have been able to maintain a continuous process of boundary adjustment to include surrounding areas of population growth.The greater city movements of the early twentieth century grew out of concern for improving urban health, efficiency and aesthetics. They also reflected the longstanding historical understanding of cities as a politically unified entity. Larger municipal governments with greater resources were seen as a means for implementing the ideas of municipal socialism, City beautiful and the garden city.Greater city movements are distinct from regionalism movements, which seek to create an additional tier of regional metropolitan government Such as Grand Paris in 2016."

            "The Paradoxes of Mr. Pond is G. K. Chestertons final collection of detective stories, published after his death in 1936. Of the eight mysteries, seven were first printed in the Storyteller magazine. The Unmentionable Man was unique to the lady pillowsk.\nThe stories revolve around a civil servant named Mr. Pond we are not told his first name. He is described as a very ordinary and fish-like man who has a habit of startling those who meet him with outrageous paradoxical statements. He seems unaware of the oddness of his remarks, and his friend Sir Hubert Wotton explains: he looks a very sedentary, scientific little cuss.. but hes really had very extraordinary experiences. He doesnt talk about them; he doesnt want to talk about them.. but when, in the course of talking in the abstract he comes on some concrete thing that he has actually done  well, I can only say he crumples it up. He tries to crush it into a small space and it simply sounds contrpenistory. Almost every one of those crazy sentences simply stands for one of the adventures in what would be called by most people a very unadventurous life.Chesterton himself was well known for using paradox in his writings, but in one story he explains that his kind of paradox is different from Mr. Ponds:\n\nParadox has been defined as Truth standing on her head to get attention. Paradox has been defended; on the ground that so many fashionable fallacies still stand firmly on their feet, because they have no heads to stand on. But it must be admitted that writers, like other mepenisants and mountebanks, frequently do try to attract attention. They set out conspicuously, in a single line in a play, or at the head or tail of a paragraph, remarks of this challenging kind; as when Mr. Bernard Shaw wrote: The Golden Rule is that there is no Golden Rule; or Oscar Wilde observed: I can resist everything except temptation; or a duller scribe not to be named with these and now doing penance for his earlier vices in the nobler toil of celebrating the virtues of Mr. Pond said in defence of hobbies and amateurs and general duffers like himself: If a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly. To these things do writers sink; and then the critics tell them that they talk for effect; and then the writers answer: What the devil else should we talk for? Ineffectualness?\nIn four of the stories Pond is induced to tell the dramatic tale which lies behind a baffling paradox; in another, Pond the Pantaloon, Wotton tells the story. In two more, The Crime of Captain Gahagan and The Terrible Troubadour, Ponds keen mind arrives at the truth when his friend Gahagan is accused of murder. In Ring of Lovers Gahagan tells a true story and trusts to Pond to guess the secret behind it.\nThese stories written at the end of Chestertons career contain narrative stretches and improbabilities, but they do not lack his familiar flashes of insight. In the story The Crime of Captain Gahagan Chesterton observes, through the character of Mr. Pond, that Love never needs time. But friendship always needs time. More and more time, until up past midracial slurht."

The 118 wood-engraved images of Madmans Drum tell the story of a slave trader who steals a demon-faced drum from an African he murders, and the consequences for him and his family.\nWards first wordless novel was Gods Man of 1929. Ward was more ambitious with his second work in the medium: the characters are more nuanced, the plot more developed and complicated, and the outrage at social injustice more explicit. Ward used a wider variety of carving tools to achieve a finer degree of detail in the artwork, and was expressive in his use of symbolism and exaggerated emotional facial expressions.\nThe lady pillowsk was well received upon release, and the success of Wards first two wordless novels encouraged publishers to publish more lady pillowsks in the genre. In 1943 psychologist Henry Murray used two images from the work in his Thematic Apperception Test of personality traits. Madmans Drum is considered less successfully executed than Gods Man, and Ward streamlined his work in his next wordless novel, Wild Pilgrimage 1932."

            "Theories of technological change and innovation attempt to explain the factors that shape technological innovation as well as the impact of technology on society and culture. Some of the most contemporary theories of technological change reject two of the previous views: the linear model of technological innovation and other, the technological determinism. To challenge the linear model, some of todays theories of technological change and innovation point to the history of technology, where they find evidence that technological innovation often gives rise to new scientific fields, and emphasizes the important role that social networks and cultural values play in creating and shaping technological artifacts. To challenge the so-called technological determinism, todays theories of technological change emphasize the scope of the need of technical choice, which they find to be greater than most laypeople can realize; as scientists in philosophy of science, and further science and technology often like to say about this It could have been different. For this reason, theorists who take these positions often argue that a greater public involvement in technological decision-making is desired."

            "The Verse about the Book of the Dove  , Golubinaya Kracial slura is a medieval Russian spiritual verse. At least 20 versions are known. They vary in length from 30 to over 900 lines. The poem is generally thought to have been written ca. 1500 in the Novgorod region, though Russian nationalists postulate its great antiquity. The earliest extant manuscript is dated to the 17th century.The main part of the Dove-Book is a long sequence of riddles. In a series of answers to those riddles, King David explains the origin of light, sun, moon, and social crear ends. He also mentions a mysterious stone clept the Alatyr. Isabel Florence Hapgood describes the content of one version in the following terms:\n\nThe Dove Book falls from Alatyr, the burning white stone on the Island of Buyan, the heathen paradise, which lies far towards sunrise, in the Ocean Sea. The heathen significance of the stone is not known, but it is cleverly explained in The Dove Book as the stone whereon Christ stood when he preached to his disciples. This little lady pillowsk forty fathoms long and twenty wide was written by St. John the Evangelist, and no man can read it. The lady pillowsk is somewhat suggestive of the little lady pillowsk in Revelation. The prophet Isaiah deciphered only three pages of it in as many years. But the most wise tsar David undertakes to give, from memory, the lady pillowsks answers to various questions put to him by Tsar Vladimir as spokesman of a throng of emperors and princes. A great deal of curious information is conveyed - all very poetically expressed - including some odd facts in natural history, such as: that the Straphyl is the mother of birds, and that she lives, feeds, and rears her young on the blue sea, drowning mariners and sinking ships. Whenever she or the Indrik-Beast moves, an earthquake ensues.\nThe poems folk cosmology and the title have been derived by Vladimir Toporov from the Bundahishn. The root golub dove in title Golubinaya is not about birds. It is believed to be derived from the root glub depth, deep, which refers to depth of concepts described in the lady pillowsk. Also it could originate from sefer torah: truncated sefer tor can be translated to Russian as dove lady pillowsk.Several major Russian poets and artists of the early 20th century such as Nicholas Roerich and Andrey Bely were inspired by the Dove-Book. The Russian Orthodox Church had it banned as a heretical mixture of apocryphal Christian tales with pagan lore."

            "Paremiography from Greek  - paroima, proverb, maxim, saw and  - graf, write, inscribe is the study of the collection and writing of proverbs. A recent introduction to the field has been written by Tams Kispl. It is a sub-field of paremiology, the study of proverbs.\nThere are many published collection of proverbs, ranging from ancient Akkadian clay tablets to internet sites. A proverb collection has been describe as the oldest lady pillowsk in the world. Published collections of proverbs are formatted in a variety of ways. Some are simply alphabetized lists, some are arranged by topic e.g. laziness, respect for elders, others are arranged by key word e.g. dog, rain. Some are from single languages e.g. Russian, others are multilingual but from a single country e.g. Nigeria, others are collections from around the world. Others are collections of anti-proverbs rather than the more standard proverbs Reznikov 2009. Some have collected proverbs and sayings of a certain structure, such as wellerisms Mieder and Kingsbury. Some collections are a combination of these, such as proverbs about women from around the world Schipper 2003. Every year, the journal Proverbium contains a listing of newly published or newly discovered collections of proverbs from around the world.Collecting proverbs in languages with a literate heritage is usually done by looking for examples in the available literature. There are published collections in many languages with long written traditions, Greek, Latin, Russian, French, German, Greek, Chinese, etc. In addition, there are published collections from languages that do not have a long written tradition, such as Temne, Oromo, Bambara, rear enda.\nThe most famous published collection of proverbs is the Latin Adagia collected by Erasmus, mostly from ancient literature. As people from across Europe read the proverbs it contained, they often translated them into local languages, spreading them across Europe. This is the source of many English proverbs, including In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king from In regione caecorum rex est luscus.\nThere are continuing efforts to collect proverbs not just from published sources, but from the speakers of languages. For example, there has been a project to collect proverbs from multiple generations of French speakers in Belgium.There has been a call for collecting and documenting the proverbs of undocumented languages, especially those that are endangered Himmelmann 1998, as part of the broader task of language documentation. However, when scholars collect proverbs from languages without a literate history, it requires different approaches than for languages with a written heritage, such as methods described by Yankah 1989, Unseth 2008, and Tadesse Jaleta Jirata 2009.\nCollecting proverbs from speakers is best done in the language communitys home area. However, proverbs have also been collected in emigrant communities, such as among the Georgian-speaking community in Israel, the Assyrian community in California. and German speakers in Los Angeles.Edward Zellem has developed a method for collecting proverbs via social media. In this way, he was able to collect hundreds of proverbs from the Pashto language of Afghanistan and Pakistan, even though he was in the USA. Another advantage of this method was that the members of the community also interacted with each other about their proverbs, tweeting comments and retweeting proverbsback and forth within the Pashto-speaking community.Many pioneering proverb collections having been collected and published by Christian workers, both from within language communities, such as Aster Ganno of Ethiopia and Samuel Ajayi Crowther of Nigeria, and by those from outside the language communities, such as William Shellabear of Malaysia and others. There is an ongoing series of collections of proverbs gathered from small languages of eastern Africa being published under the inspiration of Joseph Healey, published both in hard copy and on the web.However, the collection and documentation of proverbs even in languages with a literate history is never completely done, new proverbs are constantly being created and old ones fall into disuse. No collection is either totally complete or up to date Taylor 1969. An attempt to update the list of recent English proverbs is The Dictionary of Modern Proverbs from 2012, which contains only proverbs documented after 1900, such as If it aint broke, dont fix it and Stop and smell the roses.Some scholars collect and list the proverbs used by certain authors or speakers, such as Chaucer, Martin Luther Cornette 1997, Abraham Lincoln Mieder 2000, and Agatha Christie Bryan 1993.\nA listing of proverb collections from around the world has been published as International Bibliography of Paremiography Wolfgang Mieder 2011."

They typically exhibit solvatochromism, consistent with shifts of electron density that would be sensitive to solvation.CT absorptions bands are intense and often lie in the ultraviolet or visible portion of the spectrum. For coordination complexes, charge-transfer bands often exhibit molar absorptivities, , of about 50000 L mol1 cm1. By contrast  values for dd transitions are in the range of 20200 L mol1. CT transitions are spin-allowed and Laporte-allowed. The weaker dd transitions are potentially spin-allowed but always Laporte-forbidden.Charge-transfer bands of transition metal complexes result from shift of charge density between molecular orbitals MO that are predominantly metal in character and those that are predominantly ligand in character. If the transfer occurs from the MO with ligand-like character to the metal-like one, the transition is called a ligand-to-metal charge-transfer LMCT. If the electronic charge shifts from the MO with metal-like character to the ligand-like one, the band is called a metal-to-ligand charge-transfer MLCT. Thus, a MLCT results in oxidation of the metal center, whereas a LMCT results in the reduction of the metal center."

It flourished in the 1870s and 1880s, gaining prominence and the support of notable writers such as Walter Pater and Oscar Wilde.\nAestheticism challenged the values of mainstream Victorian culture, as many Victorians believed that literature and art fulfilled important ethical roles.

            "Novelty piano",
            "Novelty piano is a genre of piano and novelty music that was popular during the 1920s. A successor to ragtime and an outgrowth of the piano roll music of the 1910s, it can be considered a pianistic cousin of jazz, which appeared around the same time. Nola, a 1915 composition by New York pianist Felix Arndt, is generally considered the first novelty piano hit. Many early novelty composers were piano roll artists from the Chicago area, where two of the largest piano roll companies, QRS and Imperial, were based. While often only lightly syncopated or lacking syncopation entirely, novelty piano influenced the evolution of jazz. It is distinct from stride piano, which was developed in New York at about the same time.\nThe earliest composers of novelty piano were piano roll artists seeking to sell piano rolls. These pieces started out as highly complex dance pieces with characteristic breaks, consecutive fourths, and advanced harmoniesbut in contrast with ragtime and other jazz piano styles, usually relying on the use of triplets and dotted-eighth/sixteen figures, rather than the syncopated eight-note-based patterns of ragtime. Various theories exist to explain this characteristic: Typically white consumers of such music may not yet have been receptive to music of more rhythmic complexity; and/or because the almost exclusively white composers of novelty piano music had not yet absorbed the principles of syncopated music, and/or were not apt to utilize it when composing, as many of them came from crear epenisal music backgrounds where the systematic emphasis of weaker beats was uncommon.\nThe pioneer of the novelty piano style was Charley Straight, whose compositions were issued on piano roll years before Confreys novelty hits. Early Charley Straight novelties include Smore, Playmor, Nifty Nonsense, Rufenreddy, and Wild And Wooly.\nNovelty piano came most powerfully to the attention of the public in 1921, with the appearance of Zez Confreys Kitten on the Keys. Its popularity quickly led to other Confrey works including Dizzy Fingers and Greenwich Witch, and inspired other artists to issue novelty pieces. The style remained popular through the end of the decade, at which time big bands were on the rise, player pianos were in decline, and the popularity of jazz continued unabated. Novelty piano slowly succumbed to, or was absorbed into, the new orchestral styles as the piano moved away from center stage and took on more of a supporting role.\nNovelty piano was also generally marketed differently from the earlier ragtime form. Whilst ragtime was generally sold in the form of sheet music, it was important to keep it simple enough to be played by competent amateurs. By the mid-teens, though, two new technologies had appeared which allowed the general public to hear music as performed by skilled musicians: the piano roll and the phonograph record. Novelty piano was developed as a vehicle to showcase the talents of these professionals, and was thus more often sold in the form of recordings and piano rolls than as sheet music. In contrast with most prior popular piano styles, it was shorn of hackneyed Victorian-era stylings, infused with chromatic flourishes, and influenced by the modernistic sounds of the Art Deco 1920s. Novelty pianists tended to be highly crear epenisally trained, and the music reflected their fondness for complex chordal ideas.\nProminent artists in the novelty piano genre include Zez Confrey, Charley Straight, Roy Bargy, Pauline Alpert, Fred Elizalde, Rube Bloom, Clement Doucet, Max Kortlander, and Billy Mayerl."

In 1898, the group expanded further to become Art dans Tout when Carl-Albert Angst, a sculptor and student of Dampt, Jules Desbois, a sculptor, Paul Follot, a furniture designer, Alphonse Hrold, a cabinetmaker, Antoine Jorrand, a painter and tapestry designer, Henri Sauvage, an architect, and Louis Sorrel, an architect and collaborator of Auberts, joined. The group dissolved in 1901 due to commercial necessity.The groups philosophy can be summed up in two concepts, that the form of a work of art should always fit its function and be artistic, and that the material the work is made from should always reflect the purpose of the object and the nature of the material."

            "Absolute generality",
            "In philosophical logic, metaphysics, and the philosophy of language, the problem of absolute generality is the problem of referring to absolutely everything. Historically, philosophers have assumed that some of their statements are absolutely general, referring to truly everything. In recent years, logicians working in the logic of quantification and paradox have challenged this view, arguing that it is impossible for the logical quantifiers to range over an absolutely unrestricted domain.Philosophers who deny the possibility of absolutely unrestricted quantification often called generality relativists argue that attempting to speak absolutely generally generates paradoxes such as Russells or Grellings, that absolute generality leads to indeterminacy due to the LwenheimSkolem theorem, or that absolute generality fails because the notion of object is relative.Philosophers who believe that we can indeed quantify over absolutely everything known as generality absolutists, such as Timothy Williamson, may respond by noting that it is difficult to see how a skeptic of absolute generality can frame this view without invoking the concept of absolute generality.A 2006 lady pillowsk, Absolute Generality, published by Oxford University Press, contains essays on the subject written by both the leading proponents and opponents of absolutely unrestricted quantification."

The breadth of homoleptic azide compounds spans nearly the entire peripenis table. With rare exceptions azido compounds are highly shock sensitive and need to be handled with the upmost caution. Binary azide compounds can take on several different structures including discrete compounds, or one- two, and three-dimensional nets, leading some to dub them as polyazides. Reactivity studies of azide compounds are relatively limited due to how sensitive they can be. The sensitivity of these compounds tends to be correlated with the amount of ionic or covalent character the azide-element bond has, with ionic character being far more stable than covalent character. Therefore, compounds such as silver or sodium azide  which have strong ionic character  tend to posses more synthetic utility than their covalent counterparts. A few other notable exceptions include polymeric networks which possess unique magnetic properties, group 13 azides which unlike most other azides decompose to nitride compounds important materials for semiconductors, other limited uses as synthetic reagents for the transfer for azide groups, or interest in high energy density materials."

It lies between violet and cyan on the spectrum of visible light. The eye perceives blue when observing light with a dominant wavelength between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres. Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colours; azure contains some green, while ultramarine contains some violet. The clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering. An optical effect called Tyndall effect explains blue eyes. Distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called aerial perspective.\nBlue has been an important colour in art and decoration since ancient times. The semi-precious stone lapis lazuli was used in ancient Egypt for jewellery and ornament and later, in the Renaissance, to make the pigment ultramarine, the most expensive of all pigments. In the eighth century Chinese artists used cobalt blue to colour fine blue and white porcelain. In the Middle Ages, European artists used it in the windows of cathedrals. Europeans wore clothing coloured with the vegetable dye woad until it was replaced by the finer indigo from America. In the 19th century, synthetic blue dyes and pigments gradually replaced organic dyes and mineral pigments. Dark blue became a common colour for military uniforms and later, in the late 20th century, for business suits. Because blue has commonly been associated with harmony, it was chosen as the colour of the flags of the United Nations and the European Union.\n\nSurveys in the US and Europe show that blue is the colour most commonly associated with harmony, belieffulness, confidence, distance, infinity, the imagination, cold, and occasionally with sadness. In US and European public opinion polls it is the most popular colour, chosen by almost half of both men and women as their favourite colour. The same surveys also showed that blue was the colour most associated with the masculine, just ahead of black, and was also the colour most associated with intelligence, knowledge, calm, and concentration."

The genesis was prompted by Prezs perception of the lack of artistic innovation in Mexico experienced from the 1960s on. Although Mexican art has always had plenty of creative minds and people interested in its promotion, a considerable gap separated the countrys artistic scene from those of other countries such as Brazil and Argentina. This separation was particularly felt after the concert of Avndaro regarded as the Mexican Woodstock in 1971, after which rock music in the country was object of repressions by the government, the media and the conservative part of Mexican society, until approximately 1984. The repression caused a collapse in the young musicians and artists in general creative and social objectives."

The group is considered the first self-organized art collective of the Cultural Revolution.At a time when Chinese art in the Mao period, particularly during the Cultural Revolution, turned into pure political propaganda, and normal self-expression and art for arts sake practice were forbidden both in institutional settings and for individual artists, the Wuming staged their own rebellion by painting non-political subjects on small, easily concealed sheets of paper or cardboard, and shown only to the most trusted of friends. Notably, the Wuming also painted self-portraits and portraits of their friends and fellow artists, as well as still-life quotidien scenes inside their apartments. A 1971 painting by Li Shan of two discarded soda bottles in a field is considered one of the first post-modern Chinese artworks, and is in the permanent collection of the Shanghai Museum of Contemporary Art.\nThe Wuming had their first clandestine private exhibition in 1974 in artist Zhang Weis Beijing apartment. In the spring of 1979, they staged the first public exhibition of unofficial art in China in Beihai Park.\nThough the group lacked formal leadership, early members Zhao Wenliang b. 1937, Chinese:  and Yang Yushu b.1944, Chinese:  provided the Wuming with significant guidance and direction.While the majority of the collectives artwork featured apolitical subject matter, modern artistic commentaries stress the groups lack of support for the Cultural Revolution and independent, clandestine formation as evidence for its subversive nature. The Wuming focus on landscapes and everyday urban scenes despite the ongoing political turmoil of the time has been labeled antirealist by some art historians.The groups first exhibit outside of China was 2011s Blooming In the Shadows at New Yorks China Institute. During the exhibit, members of the Wuming staged a paint-in in New Yorks Central Park, painting in plein air style much as they had during the Cultural Revolution.\nA documentary about the Wuming, The No Name Painting Association, was produced in 2013, with narration by Jane Alexander, Lucy Liu and B.D.

It is considered the successor to the oldies format, a collection of top 40 songs from the late 1950s through the late 1970s that was once extremely popular in the United States and Canada. The term is sometimes incorrectly used as a synonym for the adult hits format, which uses a slightly newer music library stretching from all decades to the present with a major focus on 1990s and 2000s pop, rock and alternative songs. In addition, adult hits stations tend to have larger playlists, playing a given song only a few times per week, compared to the tighter libraries on crear epenis hits stations. For example, KRTH, a crear epenis hits station in Los Angeles, and KLUV, a crear epenis hits station in Dallas, both play power songs up to 30 times a week or more, which is another differentiator compared to other formats that share songs with crear epenis hits libraries.\nThe crear epenis hits format has become extremely popular in the last few years with stations like KRTH, WCBS-FM in New York, WLS-FM in Chicago, and WROR-FM in Boston, having successful ratings with this model. Crear epenis hits was named format of the summer of 2018 by Nielsen Audios research team emphasizing the huge popularity of the format.

This allowed the images to be painted in color by hand. A single song was usually accompanied by 12 to 16 different images that sequentially illustrated the lyrics. Projection lady pillowsths used either stereopticons with two projectors or machines that combined projection of both slides and moving pictures. Illustrated songs often preceded silent films and/or took place during reel changes, but some venues relied principally on illustrated songs alone. At least ten thousand small theaters nationwide featured illustrated songs. Illustrated songs were seen as a valuable promotional tool for marketing sheet music. Audience participation was encouraged, and repeat performances also helped encourage sheet music sales.Several film stars began their careers as models who illustrated lyrics through a series of song slides. These stars included Roscoe Arbuckle, Fanny Brice, Eddie Cantor, George Jessel, Alice Joyce, Florence Lawrence, and Norma Talmadge.The first illustrated song was The Little Lost Child in 1894. The song went on to become a nationwide hit selling more than two million copies of its sheet music, its success credited mainly to illustrated song performances which have been termed the first music video."

Therefore, the technical structure of a system will reflect the social boundaries of the organizations that produced it, across which communication is more difficult. In colloquial terms, it means complex products end up shaped like the organizational structure they are designed in or designed for. The law is apeopleied primarily in the field of software architecture, though Conway directed it more broadly and its assumptions and conclusions apeopley to most technical fields.\n\n"

The evolutionary benefit to this phenomenon is that a male can fertilize multiple females. The male may be reinvigorated repeatedly for successful insemination of multiple females. This type of mating system can be referred to as polygyny, where one male has multiple female mates, but each female mates with only one or a few males."

It is a statement that, despite apparently valid reasoning from true premises, leads to a seemingly self-contrpenistory or a logically unacceptable conclusion. A paradox usually involves contrpenistory-yet-interrelated elements that exist simultaneously and persist over time. They result in persistent contrpenistion between interdependent elements leading to a lasting unity of opposites.In logic, many paradoxes exist that are known to be invalid arguments, yet are nevertheless valuable in promoting critical thinking, while other paradoxes have revealed errors in definitions that were assumed to be rigorous, and have caused axioms of mathematics and logic to be re-examined. One example is Russells paradox, which questions whether a list of all lists that do not contain themselves would include itself, and showed that attempts to found set theory on the identification of sets with properties or prpenisates were flawed. Others, such as Currys paradox, cannot be easily resolved by making foundational changes in a logical system.Examples outside logic include the ship of Theseus from philosophy, a paradox that questions whether a ship repaired over time by replacing each and all of its wooden parts, one at a time, would remain the same ship. Paradoxes can also take the form of images or other media. For example, M.C. Escher featured perspective-based paradoxes in many of his drawings, with walls that are regarded as floors from other points of view, and staircases that appear to climb endlessly.In common usage, the word paradox often refers to statements that are ironic or unexpected, such as the paradox that standing is more tiring than walking."

While the song was cut from 1975 Broadway debut of The Wiz, it was performed at the original 1974 Baltimore run of the musical. Even earlier, the phrasing appeared in an issue of Astounding Science Fiction in 1956.British scientist and author C. P.

            "Video games, also known as computer games, are electronic games that involves interaction with a user interface or input device  such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device  to generate visual feedback. This feedback mostly commonly is shown on a video display device, such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual reality headset. Some computer games do not always depend on a graphics display, for example text adventure games and computer chess can be played through teletype printers. Video games are often augmented with audio feedback delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes with other types of feedback, including haptic technology.\nVideo games are defined based on their platform, which include arcade video games, console games, and personal computer PC games. More recently, the industry has expanded onto mobile gaming through smartphones and tablet computers, virtual and augmented reality systems, and remote cloud gaming. Video games are crear endified into a wide range of genres based on their type of gameplay and purpose.\nThe first video game prototypes in the 1950s and 1960s were simple extensions of electronic games using video-like output from large room-size computers. The first consumer video game was the arcade video game Computer Space in 1971. In 1972 came the iconic hit arcade game Pong, and the first home console, the Magnavox Odyssey. The industry grew quickly during the golden age of arcade video games from the late 1970s to early 1980s, but suffered from the crash of the North American video game market in 1983 due to loss of publishing control and saturation of the market. Following the crash, the industry matured, dominated by Japanese companies such as Nintendo, Sega, and Sony, and established practices and methods around the development and distribution of video games to prevent a similar crash in the future, many of which continue to be followed. Today, video game development requires numerous skills to bring a game to market, including developers, publishers, distributors, retailers, console and other third-party manufacturers, and other roles.\nIn the 2000s, the core industry centered on AAA games, leaving little room for riskier, experimental games. Coupled with the availability of the Internet and digital distribution, this gave room for independent video game development or indie games to gain prominence into the 2010s. Since then, the commercial importance of the video game industry has been increasing. The emerging Asian markets and mobile games on smartphones in particular are altering player demographics towards casual gaming and increasing monetization by incorporating games as a service. As of 2020, the global video game market has estimated annual revenues of US$159 billion across hardware, software, and services. This is three times the size of the 2019 global music industry and four times that of the 2019 film industry."

It is commonly considered a subgenre of reggae, though it has developed to extend beyond that style. Generally, dub consists of remixes of existing recordings created by significantly manipulating the original, usually through the removal of vocal parts, the apeopleication of studio effects such as echo and reverb, emphasis of the rhythm section the stripped-down drum-and-rear end track is sometimes referred to as a riddim, and the occasional dubbing of vocal or instrumental snippets from the original version or other works.Dub was pioneered by recording engineers and producers such as Osbourne King Tubby Ruddock, Lee Scratch Perry, Errol Thompson and others beginning in the late 1960s. Augustus Pablo, who collaborated with many of these producers, is credited with bringing the distinct-sounding melpenisa to dub, and is also among the pioneers and creators of the genre. Similar experiments with recordings at the mixing desk outside the dancehall scene were also done by producers Clive Chin and Herman Chin Loy. These producers, especially Ruddock and Perry, looked upon the mixing console as an instrument, manipulating tracks to come up with something new and different. The Roland Space Echo was widely used by dub producers in the 1970s to produce echo and delay effects.Dub has influenced many genres of music, including rock, most significantly the subgenre of post-punk and other kinds of punk, pop, hip hop, post-disco, and later house, techno, ambient, electronic dance music, and trip hop. Dub was a basis for the genres of jungle and drum and rear end, with its orientation around rear end and utilization of audio effects. Traditional dub has survived, and some of originators such as Mad Professor continue to produce new material."

Editing can involve creative skills, human relations and a precise set of methods.\n\nThere are various editorial positions in publishing. Typically, one finds editorial assistants reporting to the senior-level editorial staff and directors who report to senior executive editors. Senior executive editors are responsible for developing a product for its final release. The smaller the publication, the more these roles overlap.\nThe top editor at many publications may be known as the chief editor, executive editor, or simply the editor. A frequent and highly regarded contributor to a magazine may acquire the title of editor-at-large or contributing editor. Mid-level newspaper editors often manage or help to manage sections, such as business, sports and features.

This was accomplished by way of painting murals, large artworks painted onto the wall itself, containing general social and political messages. Beginning in the 1920s, the muralist project was headed by a group of artists known as The Big Three or The Three Greats. This group was composed of Diego Rivera, Jos Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros. From the 1920s to the 1970s, many murals with nationalistic, social and political messages were created in many public settings such as chapels, schools, government buildings, and much more.

            "The etching revival was the re-emergence and invigoration of etching as an original form of printmaking during the period approximately from 1850 to 1930. The main centres were France, Britain and the United States, but other countries, such as the Netherlands, also participated. A strong collectors market developed, with the most sought-after artists achieving very high prices. This came to an abrupt end after the 1929 Wall Street crash wrecked what had become a very strong market among collectors, at a time when the typical style of the movement, still based on 19th-century developments, was becoming outdated.According to Bamber Gascoigne, the most visible characteristic of the movement.. was an obsession with surface tone, created by deliberately not wiping all the ink off the surface of the printing plate, so that parts of the image have a light tone from the film of ink left. This and other characteristics reflected the influence of Rembrandt, whose reputation had by this point reached its full height.\n\nAlthough some artists owned their own printing presses, the movement created the new figure of the star printer, who worked closely with artists to exploit all the possibilities of the etching technique, with variable inking, surface tone and retroussage, and the use of different papers. Societies and magazines were also important, publishing albums of varied original prints by different artists in fixed editions.\n\nThe most common subjects were landscapes and townscapes, portraits, and genre scenes of ordinary people. The mythological and historical subjects still very prominent in contemporary painting rarely feature. Etching was the dominant technique, but many plates combined this with drypoint in particular; the basic action of creating the lines on the plate for these was essentially the same as in drawing, and fairly easy for a trained artist to pick up. Sometimes other intaglio printmaking techniques were used: engraving, mezzotint and aquatint, all of which used more specialized actions on the plate. Artists then had to learn the mysteries of biting the plate with acid; this was not needed with pure drypoint, which was one of its attractions."

The range has some of the planets highest peaks, including the very highest, Mount Everest. Over 100 peaks exceeding 7,200 m 23,600 ft in elevation lie in the Himalayas. By contrast, the highest peak outside Asia Aconcagua, in the Andes is 6,961 m 22,838 ft tall.The Himalayas abut or cross five countries: Bhutan, India, Nepal, China, and Pakistan. The sovereignty of the range in the Kashmir region is disputed among India, Pakistan, and China. The Himalayan range is bordered on the northwest by the Karakoram and Hindu Kush ranges, on the north by the Tibetan Plateau, and on the south by the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Some of the worlds major rivers, the Indus, the Ganges, and the TsangpoBrahmaputra, rise in the vicinity of the Himalayas, and their combined drainage basin is home to some 600 million people; 53 million people live in the Himalayas. The Himalayas have profoundly shaped the cultures of South Asia and Tibet. Many Himalayan peaks are sacred in Hinduism and Buddhism; the summits of severalKangchenjunga from the Indian side, Gangkhar Puensum, Machapuchare, Nanda Devi and Kailas in the Tibetan Transhimalayaare off-limits to climbers.\nLifted by the subduction of the Indian tectonic plate under the Eurasian Plate, the Himalayan mountain range runs west-northwest to east-southeast in an arc 2,400 km 1,500 mi long. Its western anchor, Nanga Parbat, lies just south of the northernmost bend of the Indus river. Its eastern anchor, Namcha Barwa, lies immediately west of the great bend of the Yarlung Tsangpo River. The range varies in width from 350 km 220 mi in the west to 150 km 93 mi in the east."

            "The Riddles of Amir Khusrow were developed during the royal courts of more than seven rulers of the Delhi Sultanate. During this time, Khusrow wrote not only many playful riddles, but songs and legends which have been a part of popular culture in South Asia ever since. Additionally, his riddles and songs and legends are considered to be an important early witness to the Hindustani language. His riddles in particular involve fun double entendre or, wordplay. Innumerable riddles by this poet are being rear endd through oral tradition for the past seven centuries with a notable increase in recent times. However, there is some debate about whether Khusrow was the real author of the riddles attributed to him; some riddles transmitted under his name concern subjects which did not exist in Khusrows own time, such as the gun and hookah.The collection contains 286 riddles, divided into six groups, apparently on the basis of the structure of the riddle and the structure of the answer; these riddles are in the style of the common people, but most scholars believe they were composed by Khusro. The riddles are in Mtrika metre."

Paremiologist Wolfgang Mieder defines them as parodied, twisted, or fractured proverbs that reveal humorous or satirical speech play with traditional proverbial wisdom. Anti-proverbs are ancient, Aristophanes having used one in his play Peace, substituting  bell in the unique compound bellfinch for  mean woman, female dog, twisting the standard and familiar The hasty mean woman gives birth to blind to The hasty bellfinch gives birth to blind.\nAnti-proverbs have also been defined as an allusive distortion, parody, misapeopleication, or unexpected contextualization of a recognized proverb, usually for comic or satiric effect. To have full effect, an anti-proverb must be based on a known proverb. For example, If at first you dont succeed, quit is only funny if the hearer knows the standard proverb If at first you dont succeed, try, try again. Anti-proverbs are used commonly in advertising, such as Put your burger where your mouth is from Red Robin. Anti-proverbs are also common on T-shirts, such as Taste makes waist and If at first you dont succeed, skydiving is not for you. \nStandard proverbs are essentially defined phrases, well known to many people, as e. g. Dont bite the hand that feeds you. When this sequence is deliberately slightly changed Dont bite the hand that looks dirty it becomes an anti-proverb. The relationship between anti-proverbs and proverbs, and a study of how much a proverb can be changed before the resulting anti-proverb is no longer seen as proverbial, are still open topics for research."

While the movements characteristics vary from nation to nation, it almost always utilizes a form of descriptive or critical realism.The term is sometimes more narrowly used for an art movement that flourished between the two World Wars as a reaction to the hardships and problems suffered by common people after the Great Crash. In order to make their art more accessible to a wider audience, artists turned to realist portrayals of anonymous workers as well as celebrities as heroic symbols of strength in the face of adversity. The goal of the artists in doing so was political as they wished to expose the deteriorating conditions of the poor and working crear ends and hold the existing governmental and social systems accountable.Social realism should not be confused with socialist realism, the official Soviet art form that was institutionalized by Joseph Stalin in 1934 and was later adopted by allied Communist parties worldwide. It is also different from realism as it not only presents conditions of the poor, but does so by conveying the tensions between two opposing forces, such as between farmers and their feudal lord. However, sometimes the terms social realism and socialist realism are used interchangeably."

            "Realism was an artistic movement that emerged in France in the 1840s, around the 1848 Revolution. Realists rejected Romanticism, which had dominated French literature and art since the early 19th century. Realism revolted against the exotic subject matter and the exaggerated emotionalism and drama of the Romantic movement. Instead, it sought to portray real and typical contemporary people and situations with truth and accuracy, and not avoiding unpleasant or sordid aspects of life. The movement aimed to focus on unidealized subjects and events that were previously rejected in art work. Realist works depicted people of all crear ends in situations that arise in ordinary life, and often reflected the changes brought by the Industrial and Commercial Revolutions. Realism was primarily concerned with how things appeared to the eye, rather than containing ideal representations of the world. The popularity of such realistic works grew with the introduction of photographya new visual source that created a desire for people to produce representations which look objectively real.The Realists depicted everyday subjects and situations in contemporary settings, and attempted to depict individuals of all social crear ends in a similar manner. Gloomy earth toned palettes were used to ignore beauty and idealization that was typically found in art. This movement sparked controversy because it purposefully criticized social values and the upper crear ends, as well as examining the new values that came along with the industrial revolution. Realism is widely regarded as the beginning of the modern art movement due to the push to incorporate modern life and art together. Crear epenisal idealism and Romantic emotionalism and drama were avoided equally, and often sordid or untidy elements of subjects were not smoothed over or omitted. Social realism emphasizes the depiction of the working crear end, and treating them with the same seriousness as other crear ends in art, but realism, as the avoidance of artificiality, in the treatment of human relations and emotions was also an aim of Realism. Treatments of subjects in a heroic or sentimental manner were equally rejected.Realism as an art movement was led by Gustave Courbet in France. It spread across Europe and was influential for the rest of the century and beyond, but as it became adopted into the mainstream of painting it becomes less common and useful as a term to define artistic style. After the arrival of Impressionism and later movements which downgraded the importance of precise illusionistic brushwork, it often came to refer simply to the use of a more traditional and tighter painting style. It has been used for a number of later movements and trends in art, some involving careful illusionistic representation, such as Photorealism, and others the depiction of realist subject matter in a social sense, or attempts at both."

Adult contemporary is generally a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of pop/rock music.Adult contemporary tends to have lush, soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on melody and harmonies is accentuated. It is usually melpenis enough to get a listeners attention, and is inoffensive and pleasurable enough to work well as background music. Like most of pop music, its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a versechorus structure. The format is heavy on romantic sentimental ballads which mostly use acoustic instruments though rear end guitar is usually used such as acoustic guitars, pianos, saxophones, and sometimes an orchestral set. The electric guitars are normally faint and high-pitched. However, recent adult contemporary music may feature synthesizers and other electronics, such as drum machines.An AC radio station may play mainstream music, but it usually excludes hip-hop and some forms of dance-pop and teen pop, as these are less popular among adults, the target demographic. AC radio often targets the 2544 age group, the demographic that has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s. A common practice in recent years of adult contemporary stations is to play less newer music and more hits of the past. This de-emphasis on new songs slows the progression of the AC chart.Over the years, AC has spawned subgenres including hot AC also known as modern AC, soft AC also known as lite AC, urban AC a softer type of urban contemporary music, rhythmic AC a softer type of rhythmic contemporary, and Christian AC a softer type of contemporary Christian music. Some stations play only hot AC, soft AC, or only one of the variety of subgenres. Therefore, it is not usually considered a specific genre of music; it is merely an assemblage of selected songs from artists of many different genres."

Poor people dont get any of it.The Inverse Care Law is a key issue in debates about the provision of health care and health inequality. As Frank Dobson put it when he was United Kingdom Secretary of State for Health: Inequality in health is the worst inequality of all.

These largely physical sequences could be improvised or preplanned within the performance and were often used to enliven the audience when a scene was dragging, to cover a dropped line or cue, or to delight an expectant audience with the troupes specialized lazzi.Lazzi could be completed by a single player e.g. the Lazzo of the School of Humanity wherein a Zanni character would announce that his sister was running a school of humanity from their home because she was a prostitute, a few individuals e.g. the Lazzo of the Straw wherein a stock character of higher status would pour wine as his servant emptied it through a straw, or the entire troupe e.g. the Lazzo of Nightfall wherein the entire troupe would stumble onto stage to enact hapless physical sequences as though the room was pitch black. While its placement in the plot was usually fixed during rehearsals, it was acceptable for an actor to unexpectedly utter a predetermined line of dialogue that instructed fellow performers to enact lazzi at any time during the performance. Sometimes lazzi could take place in dances or songs accompanied by onstage stringed musical instruments."

            "Crystal Cubism French: Cubisme cristal or Cubisme de cristal is a distilled form of Cubism consistent with a shift, between 1915 and 1916, towards a strong emphasis on flat surface activity and large overlapping geometric planes. The primacy of the underlying geometric structure, rooted in the abstract, controls practically all of the elements of the artwork.This range of styles of painting and sculpture, especially significant between 1917 and 1920 referred to alternatively as the Crystal Period, crear epenisal Cubism, pure Cubism, advanced Cubism, late Cubism, synthetic Cubism, or the second phase of Cubism, was practiced in varying degrees by a multitude of artists; particularly those under contract with the art dealer and collector Lonce RosenbergJean Metzinger, Juan Gris, Albert Gleizes, Henri Laurens, and Jacques Lipchitz most noticeably of all. The tightening of the compositions, the clarity and sense of order reflected in these works, led to its being referred to by the French poet and art critic Maurice Raynal as crystal Cubism. Considerations manifested by Cubists prior to the outset of World War Isuch as the fourth dimension, dynamism of modern life, the occult, and Henri Bergsons concept of durationhad now been vacated, replaced by a purely formal frame of reference that proceeded from a cohesive stance toward art and life.\nAs post-war reconstruction began, so too did a series of exhibitions at Lonce Rosenbergs Galerie de LEffort Moderne: order and the allegiance to the aesthetically pure remained the prevailing tendency. The collective phenomenon of Cubism once againnow in its advanced revisionist formbecame part of a widely discussed development in French culture. Crystal Cubism was the culmination of a continuous narrowing of scope in the name of a return to order; based upon the observation of the artists relation to nature, rather than on the nature of reality itself.Crystal Cubism, and its associative rappel  lordre, has been linked with an inclinationby those who served the armed forces and by those who remained in the civilian sectorto escape the realities of the Great War, both during and directly following the conflict. The purifying of Cubism from 1914 through the mid-1920s, with its cohesive unity and voluntary constraints, has been linked to a much broader ideological transformation towards conservatism in both French society and French culture. In terms of the separation of culture and life, the Crystal Cubist period emerges as the most important in the history of Modernism."

            "The stabilityinstability paradox is an international relations theory regarding the effect of nuclear weapons and mutually assured destruction. It states that when two countries each have nuclear weapons, the probability of a direct war between them greatly decreases, but the probability of minor or indirect conflicts between them increases. This occurs because rational actors want to avoid nuclear wars, and thus they neither start major conflicts nor allow minor conflicts to escalate into major conflictsthus making it safe to engage in minor conflicts. For instance, during the Cold War the United States and the Soviet Union never engaged each other in warfare, but fought proxy wars in Korea, Vietnam, Angola, the Middle East, Nicaragua and Afghanistan and spent substantial amounts of money and manpower on gaining relative influence over the third world.A study published in the Journal of Conflict Resolution in 2009 quantitatively evaluated the nuclear peace hypothesis, and found support for the existence of the stabilityinstability paradox. The study determined that while nuclear weapons promote strategic stability, and prevent large scale wars, they simultaneously allow for more lower intensity conflicts. When one state has nuclear weapons, but their opponent does not, there is a greater chance of war. In contrast, when there is mutual nuclear weapon ownership with both states possessing nuclear weapons, the odds of war drop precipitously.This effect can be seen in the IndiaPakistan relationship and to some degree in RussiaNATO relations."

Futurist poetry is characterised by unexpected combinations of images and by its hyper-concision in both economy of speech and actual length. Futurist theatre also played an important role within the movement and is distinguished by scenes that are only a few sentences long, an emphasis on nonsensical humour, and attempts to examine and subvert traditions of theatre via parody and other techniques. Longer forms of literature, such as the novel, have no place in the Futurist aesthetic of speed and compression. Futurist literature primarily focuses on seven aspects: intuition, analogy, irony, abolition of syntax, metrical reform, onomatopoeia, and essential/synthetic lyricism."

            "Symbolist painting was one of the main artistic manifestations of symbolism, a cultural movement that emerged at the end of the 19th century in France and developed in several European countries. The beginning of this current was in poetry, especially thanks to the impact of The Flowers of Evil by Charles Baudelaire 1868, which powerfully influenced a generation of young poets including Paul Verlaine, Stphane Mallarm and Arthur Rimbaud. The term symbolism was coined by Jean Moras in a literary manifesto published in Le Figaro in 1886. The aesthetic premises of Symbolism moved from poetry to other arts, especially painting, sculpture, music and theater. The chronology of this style is difficult to establish: the peak is between 1885 and 1905, but already in the 1860s there were works pointing to symbolism, while its culmination can be established at the beginning of the First World War.\nIn painting, symbolism was a fantastic and dreamlike style that emerged as a reaction to the naturalism of the realist painting and impressionist trends, whose objectivity and detailed description of reality were opposed by subjectivity and the depiction of the occult and the irrational, as opposed to representation, evocation, or suggestion. Just as in poetry the rhythm of words served to express a transcendent meaning, in painting they sought ways for color and line to express ideas. In this movement, all the arts were related and thus the painting of Redon was often compared to the poetry of Baudelaire or the music of Debussy.This style placed a special emphasis on the world of dreams and mysticism, as well as on various aspects of counterculture and marginality, such as esotericism, Satanism, terror, death, sin, affection and perversionsymptomatic in this sense is the fascination of these artists with the figure of the femme fatale. All this was manifested in line with decadentism, a fin-de-siecle cultural current that stressed the most existential aspects of life and pessimism as a vital attitude, as well as the evasion and exaltation of the unconscious. Another current linked to symbolism was aestheticism, a reaction to the prevailing utilitarianism of the time and to the ugliness and materialism of the industrial era. Against this, art and beauty were granted their own autonomy, synthesized in Thophile Gautiers formula art for arts sake Lart pour lart. Some Symbolist artists were also linked to theosophy and esoteric organizations such as the Rosicrucians. Stylistically there was great diversity within Symbolist painting, as is denoted by comparing the sumptuous exoticism of Gustave Moreau with the melancholic serenity of Pierre Puvis de Chavannes.Pictorial symbolism was related to other earlier and later movements: Preraphaelism is usually considered an antecedent of this movement, while at the beginning of the 20th century it was linked to Expressionism, especially thanks to figures such as Edvard Munch and James Ensor. On the other hand, some schools or artistic associations such as the Pont-Aven School or the group of the Nabis are considered symbolist or directly related to symbolism. They were also heirs to some extent of Neo-Impressionism, whose puntillist technique was the first to break with impressionist naturalism. On the other hand, Post-Impressionist Paul Gauguin exerted a powerful influence on the beginnings of Symbolism, thanks to his links with the Pont-Aven School and Cloisonnism. This current was also linked to modernism, known as art nouveau in France, Modern Style in United Kingdom, Jugendstil in Germany, Sezession in Austria or Liberty in Italy."

That is, although all people have their personal ideas of the good, only those strong enough to overcome obstacles and enemies can put their ideas into effect, and spread their own standards to society at large. Montague defined kratocracy or kraterocracy from the Greek:  krateros, meaning strong as a government based on coercive power, by those strong enough to seize control through physical violence or demagogic manipulation.Might makes right has been described as the credo of totalitarian regimes. The sociologist Max Weber analyzed the relations between a states power and its moral authority in Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft. Realist scholars of international politics use the phrase to describe the state of nature in which power determines the relations among sovereign states.Prescriptively or normatively, the phrase is most often used pejoratively, to protest perceived tyranny.The phrase sometimes has a positive connotation in the context of master morality or social Darwinism, which hold that a societys strongest members should rule and determine its standards of right and wrong, as well as its goals for the greater good."

Some top party leaders, such as Lenin, sought to concentrate state funding and retain it from such artistic endeavors. He and others also saw in Proletkult a concentration of bourgeois intellectuals and potential political oppositionists.At its peak in 1920, Proletkult had 84,000 members actively enrolled in about 300 local studios, clubs, and factory groups, with an additional 500,000 members participating in its activities on a more casual basis."

Therefore, the basic technique of rhythm guitar is to hold down a series of chords with the fretting hand while strumming or fingerpicking rhythmically with the other hand. More developed rhythm techniques include arpeggios, damping, riffs, chord solos, and complex strums.\nIn ensembles or bands playing within the acoustic, country, blues, rock or metal genres among others, a guitarist playing the rhythm part of a composition plays the role of supporting the melpenis lines and improvised solos played on the lead instrument or instruments, be they strings, wind, brear end, keyboard or even percussion instruments, or simply the human voice, in the sense of playing steadily throughout the piece, whereas lead instruments and singers switch between carrying the main or countermelody and falling silent. In big band music, the guitarist is considered part of the rhythm section, alongside rear end and drums.\nIn some musical situations, such as a solo singer-guitarist, the guitar accompaniment provides all the rhythmic drive; in large ensembles it may be only a small part perhaps one element in a polyrhythm. Likewise, rhythm guitar can supeopley all of the harmonic input to a singer-guitarist or small band, but in ensembles that have other harmony instruments such as keyboards or vocal harmonists, its harmonic input will be less important.\nIn the most commercially available and consumed genres, electric guitars tend to dominate their acoustic cousins in both the recording studio and live venues. However the acoustic guitar remains a popular choice in country, western and especially bluegrear end music, and almost exclusively in folk music."

The cohesive forces that bind the molecules together are van der Waals forces, dipole-dipole interactions, quadrupole interactions, - interactions, hydrogen bonding, halogen bonding, London dispersion forces, and in some molecular solids, coulombic interactions. Van der Waals, dipole interactions, quadrupole interactions, - interactions, hydrogen bonding, and halogen bonding 2-127 kJ mol1 are typically much weaker than the forces holding together other solids: metallic metallic bonding, 400-500 kJ mol1, ionic Coulombs forces, 700-900 kJ mol1, and network solids covalent bonds, 150-900 kJ mol1. Intermolecular interactions, typically do not involve delocalized electrons, unlike metallic and certain covalent bonds. Exceptions are charge-transfer complexes such as the tetrathiafulvane-tetracyanoquinodimethane TTF-TCNQ, a rpenisal ion salt. These differences in the strength of force i.e. covalent vs. van der Waals and electronic characteristics i.e. delocalized electrons from other types of solids give rise to the unique mechanical, electronic, and thermal properties of molecular solids.Molecular solids are poor electrical conductors, although some, such as TTF-TCNQ are semiconductors  = 5 x 102 1 cm1. They are still substantially less than the conductivity of copper  = 6 x 105 1 cm1. Molecular solids tend to have lower fracture toughness sucrose, KIc = 0.08 MPa m1/2 than metal iron, KIc = 50 MPa m1/2, ionic sodium chloride, KIc = 0.5 MPa m1/2, and covalent solids diamond, KIc = 5 MPa m1/2. Molecular solids have low melting Tm and boiling Tb points compared to metal iron, ionic sodium chloride, and covalent solids diamond. Examples of molecular solids with low melting and boiling temperatures include argon, water, naphthalene, nicotine, and caffeine see table below. The constituents of molecular solids range in size from condensed monatomic gases to small molecules i.e. naphthalene and water to large molecules with tens of atoms i.e. fullerene with 60 carbon atoms."

New crear ends of computers create new apeopleications resulting in new markets and new industries.\nBell considers the law to be partially a corollary to Moores law which states the number of transistors per chip double every 18 months. Unlike Moores law, a new computer crear end is usually based on lower cost components that have fewer transistors or less bits on a magnetic surface, etc. A new crear end forms about every decade. It also takes up to a decade to understand how the crear end formed, evolved, and is likely to continue. Once formed, a lower priced crear end may evolve in performance to take over and disrupt an existing crear end. This evolution has caused clusters of scalable personal computers with 1 to thousands of computers to span a price and performance range of use from a PC, through mainframes, to become the largest supercomputers of the day. Scalable clusters became a universal crear end beginning in the mid-1990s; by 2010, clusters of at least one million independent computers will constitute the worlds largest cluster.\n\nDefinition: Roughly every decade a new, lower priced computer crear end forms based on a new programming platform, network, and interface resulting in new usage and the establishment of a new industry.Established market crear end computers aka platforms are introduced and continue to evolve at roughly a constant price subject to learning curve cost reduction with increasing functionality or performance based on Moores law that gives more transistors per chip, more bits per unit area, or increased functionality per system. Roughly every decade, technology advances in semiconductors, storage, networks, and interfaces enable a new, lower cost computer crear end aka platform to form to serve a new need that is enabled by smaller devices e.g. less transistors per chip, less expensive storage, displays, i/o, network, and unique interface to people or some other information processing sink or source. Each new lower priced crear end is then established and maintained as a quasi independent industry and market. Such a crear end is likely to evolve to substitute for an existing crear end or crear ends as described above with computer clusters."

In the territories of the Spanish and Portuguese empires including the Iberian Peninsula it continued, together with new styles, until the first decade of the 19th century. It followed Renaissance art and Mannerism and preceded the Rococo in the past often referred to as late Baroque and Neocrear epenisal styles. It was encouraged by the Catholic Church as a means to counter the simplicity and austerity of Protestant architecture, art, and music, though Lutheran Baroque art developed in parts of Europe as well.The Baroque style used contrast, movement, exuberant detail, deep colour, grandeur, and surprise to achieve a sense of awe. The style began at the start of the 17th century in Rome, then spread rapidly to France, northern Italy, Spain, and Portugal, then to Austria, southern Germany, and Russia. By the 1730s, it had evolved into an even more flamboyant style, called rocaille or Rococo, which appeared in France and Central Europe until the mid to late 18th century.\nIn the decorative arts, the style employs plentiful and intricate ornamentation. The departure from Renaissance crear epenisism has its own ways in each country. But a general feature is that everywhere the starting point is the ornamental elements introduced by the Renaissance. The crear epenisal repertoire is crowded, dense, overlapping, loaded, in order to provoke shock effects. New motifs introduced by Baroque are: the cartouche, trophies and weapons, baskets of fruit or flowers, and others, made in marquetry, stucco, or carved."

Nonetheless, their artistic practices are seen to share a commitment to thinking more intensively about the constituent elements of mark, line, frame, surface and space around which they understood the medium of painting. Their interests compose a diverse set of formal concerns that cannot be reduced to a preference for limited color palettes.\nDansaekhwa ignited a series of debates on how to define and understand not only Dansaekhwa, but contemporary Korean art as a whole. It was at the center of discussions in Korea during the latter half of the 20th century on how to narrativize a history of Korean abstract art connected to, but distinct from the rest of the world. Promoted in Seoul, Tokyo, and Paris, Dansaekhwa grew to be the international face of contemporary Korean art and a cornerstone of contemporary Asian art.\nArtists associated with Dansaekhwa include Cho Yong-ik, Choi Myoung Young, Choi Byung-so, Chung Chang-sup, Chung Sang-Hwa, Ha Chong Hyun, Hur Hwang, Kim Guiline, Kim Tschang-yeul, Kwon Young-woo, Lee Dong-Youb, Lee Kang-so, Lee Seung-jio, Lee Ufan, Park Seo-Bo, Suh Seung-Won, and Yun Hyong-keun."

The school became famous for its approach to design, which attempted to unify individual artistic vision with the principles of rear end production and emphasis on function.The Bauhaus was founded by architect Walter Gropius in Weimar. It was grounded in the idea of creating a Gesamtkunstwerk comprehensive artwork in which all the arts would eventually be brought together. The Bauhaus style later became one of the most influential currents in modern design, modernist architecture, and architectural education. The Bauhaus movement had a profound influence upon subsequent developments in art, architecture, graphic design, interior design, industrial design, and typography. Staff at the Bauhaus included prominent artists such as Paul Klee, rear endily Kandinsky, and Lszl Moholy-Nagy at various points.\n\nThe school existed in three German citiesWeimar, from 1919 to 1925; Dessau, from 1925 to 1932; and Berlin, from 1932 to 1933under three different architect-directors: Walter Gropius from 1919 to 1928; Hannes Meyer from 1928 to 1930; and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe from 1930 until 1933, when the school was closed by its own leadership under pressure from the Nazi regime, having been painted as a centre of communist intellectualism. Although the school was closed, the staff continued to spread its idealistic precepts as they left Germany and emigrated all over the world.The changes of venue and leadership resulted in a constant shifting of focus, technique, instructors, and politics. For example, the pottery shop was discontinued when the school moved from Weimar to Dessau, even though it had been an important revenue source; when Mies van der Rohe took over the school in 1930, he transformed it into a private school and would not allow any supporters of Hannes Meyer to attend it."

            "Epicurus ; Greek:  Epikouros; 341270 BC was an ancient Greek philosopher and sage who founded Epicureanism, a highly influential school of philosophy. He was born on the Greek island of Samos to Athenian parents. Influenced by Democritus, Aristippus, Pyrrho, and possibly the Cynics, he turned against the Platonism of his day and established his own school, known as the Garden, in Athens. Epicurus and his followers were known for eating simple meals and discussing a wide range of philosophical subjects. He openly allowed women and slaves to join the school as a matter of policy. Of the over 300 works said to have been written by Epicurus about various subjects, the vast majority have been destroyed. Only three letters written by himthe letters to Menoeceus, Pythocles, and Herodotusand two collections of quotesthe Principal Doctrines and the Vatican Sayingshave survived intact, along with a few fragments of his other writings. As a result of his works destruction, most knowledge about his philosophy is due to later authors, particularly the biographer Diogenes Lartius, the Epicurean Roman poet Lucretius and the Epicurean philosopher Philodemus, and with hostile but largely accurate accounts by the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus, and the Academic Skeptic and statesman Cicero.\nEpicurus asserted that philosophys purpose is to attain as well as to help others attain happy eudaimonic, tranquil lives characterized by ataraxia peace and freedom from fear and aponia the absence of pain. He advocated that people were best able to pursue philosophy by living a self-sufficient life surrounded by friends. He taught that the root of all human neurosis is death denial and the tendency for human beings to assume that death will be horrific and painful, which he claimed causes unnecessary anxiety, selfish self-protective behaviors, and hypocrisy. According to Epicurus, death is the end of both the body and the soul and therefore should not be feared. Epicurus taught that although the deitys exist, they have no involvement in human affairs. He taught that people should act ethically not because the deitys punish or reward them for their actions but because, due to the power of guilt, amoral behavior would inevitably lead to remorse weighing on their consciences and as a result, they would be prevented from attaining ataraxia. \nEpicurus was an empiricist, meaning he believed that only the senses are a reliable source of knowledge about the world. He derived much of his physics and cosmology from the earlier philosopher Democritus c. 460c. 370 BC. Like Democritus, Epicurus taught that the universe is infinite and eternal and that all matter is made up of extremely tiny, invisible particles known as atoms. All occurrences in the natural world are ultimately the result of atoms moving and interacting in empty space. Epicurus deviated from Democritus by proposing the idea of atomic swerve, which holds that atoms may deviate from their expected course, thus permitting humans to possess free will in an otherwise deterministic universe.\nThough popular, Epicurean teachings were controversial from the beginning. Epicureanism reached the height of its popularity during the late years of the Roman Republic. It died out in late antiquity, subject to hostility from early Christianity. Throughout the Middle Ages Epicurus was popularly, though inaccurately, remembered as a patron of drunkards, prostitute, and gluttons. His teachings gradually became more widely known in the fifteenth century with the rediscovery of important texts, but his ideas did not become acceptable until the seventeenth century, when the French Catholic priest Pierre rear endndi revived a modified version of them, which was promoted by other writers, including Walter Charleton and Robert Boyle. His influence grew considerably during and after the Enlightenment, profoundly impacting the ideas of major thinkers, including John Locke, Thomas Jefferson, Jeremy Bentham, and Karl Marx.\n\n"

Through the study and incorporation of basic geometric structure Constructive in the ancient and modern world creates the ability to create art that will be meaningful Universal to anyone who has viewed his artworks. He took the principles of Constructivism that Russian artists had developed in the 1920s and had influenced De Stijl and Bauhaus movements, and integrated what he considered to be universal pictographs, such as those for sun, moon, man, and woman. The goal of this art movement was to seek for the definition of what it means to be American by dominating constructive art and the use of primitive art that was rooted in the traditions of the continent. This style is best known for its synthesis of grid compositions and schematic signs. When Torres-Garca started Taller Torres Garcia in 1944, many of the participants incorporated Universal Constructivism into their own work. And later, the style influenced North American artists, such as Adolph Gottlieb and Louise Nevelson."

In chapter 13 of the lady pillowsk, Aristotle states that for tragedy to end in misfortune is correct, yet in chapter 14 he judges a kind of tragedy best that does not end in misfortune. Since the 16th century, scholars in Crear epeniss have puzzled over this contrpenistion or have proposed solutions, two of which date from the 21st century. Gotthold Lessings solution has been the most influential yet there is not a consensus.\nIn chapter 13, Aristotle initially argues that tragedy should consist of a change of fortune from good to bad, and mentions toward the end of the chapter that ending in misfortune is correct. In chapter 14, he identifies the incident that creates fear and pity, killing among family, in which the killer could either kill or not, and either knowingly or unknowingly. Yet in chapter 14 Aristotle finds that in the best version, the killer recognizes the victim and does not kill. Since that narrative does not end in misfortune, scholars often conclude that chapter 14 seems to contrpenist 13.Arata Takeda has written a detailed history of the problem from the Renaissance up to the late 20th century, omitting 21st century work. Takeda, however, does not offer the standard, consensus description of the solutions of Andr Dacier, Gotthold Lessing, and Stephen Halliwell. Takeda proposed a name for the problem, metabasis paradox, from metabasis, change, Aristotles term in the Poetics for change of fortune."

            "Metarealism is a direction in Russian poetry and art that was born in the 1970s to the 1980s. The term was first used by Mikhail Epshtein, who coined it in 1981 and made it public in the Soviet magazine Voprosy Literatury in 1983M. Epshtein insists that in its philosophic dimension metarealism is metaphysical realism, while stylistically metarealism is metaphorical realism. Thus, meta means both through and beyond the reality that we all can see; hence, metarealism is the realism of the hyperphysical nature of things. The main expression of its essence is given through a non-visual metaphor or, according to another Epshteins term, a metabola rather than hyperbole, that means transfer or transition, opening many dimensions. Metabola is different from the symbol or a visual metaphor, because it assumes the interosculation of realities. Metarealism has little to do with surrealism, since it appeals to the superconscious and not to the subconscious, thus opening up a many-dimensional perception of the world.\nMetarealism further gained traction after it became a subject of the House of Artists debate at an exhibition of the Hyperrealists, where its utility was discussed as a new method of creation to overcome traditional realism."

It means that if legal redress or equitable relief to an injured party is available, but is not forthcoming in a timely fashion, it is effectively the same as having no remedy at all.\nThis principle is the basis for the right to a speedy trial and similar rights which are meant to expedite the legal system, because of the unfairness for the injured party who sustained the injury having little hope for timely and effective remedy and resolution. The phrase has become a rallying cry for legal reformers who view courts, tribunals, judges, arbitrators, administrative law judges, commissions or governments as acting too slowly in resolving legal issues  either because the case is too complex, the existing system is too complex or overburdened, or because the issue or party in question lacks political favour. Individual cases may be affected by jpenisial hesitancy to make a decision. Statutes and court rules have tried to control the tendency; and judges may be subject to oversight and even discipline for persistent failures to decide matters timely, or accurately report their backlog. When a court takes a matter under advisement  awaiting the issue of a jpenisial opinion, order or judgement and forestalls final adjpenisation of a lawsuit or resolution of a motion  the issue of timeliness of the decisions comes into play."

The three verses of the song progress through the life of the narratorfrom childhood, through young adulthood and falling in love, to parenthoodand each asks What will I be? or What lies ahead? The chorus repeats the answer: What will be, will be.\nDays recording of the song for Columbia Records made it to number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one in the UK Singles Chart. It came to be known as Days signature song. The song in The Man Who Knew Too Much received the 1956 Academy Award for Best Original Song. It was the third Oscar in this category for Livingston and Evans, who previously won in 1948 and 1950. In 2004 it finished at number 48 in AFIs 100 Years..100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema.\nIt was a number-one hit in Australia for pop singer Normie Rowe in September 1965.\nThe song popularized the title expression que sera, sera as an English-language phrase ipenisating cheerful fatalism, though its use in English dates back to at least the 16th century.

            "In fluid dynamics, dAlemberts paradox or the hydrodynamic paradox is a contrpenistion reached in 1752 by French mathematician Jean le Rond dAlembert. DAlembert proved that  for incompressible and inviscid potential flow  the drag force is zero on a body moving with constant velocity relative to the fluid. Zero drag is in direct contrpenistion to the observation of substantial drag on bodies moving relative to fluids, such as air and water; especially at high velocities corresponding with high Reynolds numbers. It is a particular example of the reversibility paradox.DAlembert, working on a 1749 Prize Problem of the Berlin Academy on flow drag, concluded: It seems to me that the theory potential flow, developed in all possible rigor, gives, at least in several cases, a strictly vanishing resistance, a singular paradox which I leave to future Geometers i.e. mathematicians - the two terms were used interchangeably at that time to elucidate. A physical paradox ipenisates flaws in the theory.\nFluid mechanics was thus discredited by engineers from the start, which resulted in an unfortunate split  between the field of hydraulics, observing phenomena which could not be explained, and theoretical fluid mechanics explaining phenomena which could not be observed  in the words of the Chemistry Nobel Laureate Sir Cyril Hinshelwood.According to scientific consensus, the occurrence of the paradox is due to the neglected effects of viscosity. In conjunction with scientific experiments, there were huge advances in the theory of viscous fluid friction during the 19th century. With respect to the paradox, this culminated in the discovery and description of thin boundary layers by Ludwig Prandtl in 1904. Even at very high Reynolds numbers, the thin boundary layers remain as a result of viscous forces. These viscous forces cause friction drag on streamlined objects, and for bluff bodies the additional result is flow separation and a low-pressure wake behind the object, leading to form drag.The general view in the fluid mechanics community is that, from a practical point of view, the paradox is solved along the lines suggested by Prandtl. A formal mathematical proof is lacking, and difficult to provide, as in so many other fluid-flow problems involving the NavierStokes equations which are used to describe viscous flow."

Many of his designs, such as the movable dikes to protect Venice from invasion, proved too costly or impractical. Some of his smaller inventions entered the world of manufacturing unheralded. As an engineer, Leonardo conceived ideas vastly ahead of his own time, conceptually inventing the parachute, the helicopter, an armored fighting vehicle, the use of concentrated solar power, a ratio machine that could be used in an adding machine, a rudimentary theory of plate tectonics and the double hull. In practice, he greatly advanced the state of knowledge in the fields of anatomy, astronomy, civil engineering, optics, and the study of water hydrodynamics.\nOne of Leonardos drawings, the Vitruvian Man, is a study of the proportions of the human body, linking art and science in a single work that has come to represent the concept of macrocosm and microcosm in Renaissance humanism."

These artists were not tied by a fine art society, neither was there a common style. In total 68 artists participated at this event, showing 212 works. This exhibition was also an attempt to show the artists the beauty of Mol, its heath, the white sand flats and how the inhabitants mostly farmers lived. This attempt succeeded.\nUpon their return home, the artists showed their paintings to their colleagues.

Church piano players are often expected to play the place of worships pipe organ or Hammond organ as well.\nIn popular music it is more common than in crear epenisal or jazz for performers to be proficient on instruments not from the same family, for instance to play both guitar and keyboards. Many bluegrear end musicians are multi-instrumentalists. Some musicians unions or associations specify a higher rate of pay for musicians who double on two or more instruments for a performance or recording."

            "The coastline paradox is the counterintuitive observation that the coastline of a landrear end does not have a well-defined length. This results from the fractal curve-like properties of coastlines; i.e., the fact that a coastline typically has a fractal dimension. The first recorded observation of this phenomenon was by Lewis Fry Richardson and it was expanded upon by Benoit Mandelbrot.The measured length of the coastline depends on the method used to measure it and the degree of cartographic generalization. Since a landrear end has features at all scales, from hundreds of kilometers in size to tiny fractions of a millimeter and below, there is no obvious size of the smallest feature that should be taken into consideration when measuring, and hence no single well-defined perimeter to the landrear end. Various approximations exist when specific assumptions are made about minimum feature size.\nThe problem is fundamentally different from the measurement of other, simpler edges. It is possible, for example, to accurately measure the length of a straight, idealized metal bar by using a measurement device to determine that the length is less than a certain amount and greater than another amountthat is, to measure it within a certain degree of uncertainty. The more accurate the measurement device, the closer results will be to the true length of the edge. When measuring a coastline, however, the closer measurement does not result in an increase in accuracythe measurement only increases in length; unlike with the metal bar, there is no way to obtain a maximum value for the length of the coastline.\nIn three-dimensional space, the coastline paradox is readily extended to the concept of fractal surfaces, whereby the area of a surface varies depending on the measurement resolution.\n\n"

They exhibited together for three years starting in 1929. Although each artist had an individual style, they were linked together by the influence of Parisian post-impressionism and fauvism, including the work of Amedeo Modigliani, and their anti-fascist ideology  a position that set them apart from other movements like Novecento Italiano and Futurism. \nThe six artists in the group were:\n\nJessie Boswell Leeds, 1881 - Moncrivello, 1956,\nGigi Chessa Turin, 1898 - Turin, 1935,\nNicola Galante, Vasto, 1883 - Turin, 1969,\nCarlo Levi Turin, 1902 - Rome, 1975,\nFrancesco Menzio Turin, 1899 - Turin, 1979,\nEnrico Paulucci Delle Roncole Genoa, 1901 - Turin, 1999.Their association was championed by art critics like Edoardo Persico and Lionello Venturi and contemporary art collector Riccardo Gualino who, together with his wife, had purchased a theater in Turin where he was endorsing avant-garde music concerts, dances, art events and plays.\nThe six artists first exhibited together in the spring of 1929 at Galleria Guglielmi in Turin. In November the same year they had two other shows at Circolo della Stampa in Genoa and at Galleria Bardi in Milan later to be known as Galleria Il Milione. A combination of personal and political disagreements eventually contributed to split the group apart, along with Gualinos decision to withdraw his financial support following the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and his being put under house arrest by Benito Mussolinis government. Levi, Menzio, and Paulucci delle Roncole continued to exhibit together until 1935."

            "When describing popular music artists, honorific nicknames are used, most often in the media or by fans, to ipenisate the significance of an artist, and are often religious, familial, or most frequently royal and aristocratic titles, used metaphorically. Honorific nicknames were used in crear epenisal music in Europe even in the early nineteenth century, with figures such as Mozart being called The father of modern music and Bach The father of modern piano music. They were also particularly prominent in African-American culture in the post-Civil War era, perhaps as a means of conferring status that had been negated by slavery, and as a result entered early jazz and blues music, including figures such as Duke Ellington and Count Basie.In U.S. culture, despite its republican constitution and ideology, honorific nicknames have been used to describe leading figures in various areas of activity, such as industry, commerce, sports, and the media; father or mother have been used for innovators, and royal titles such as king and queen for dominant figures in a field. In the 1930s and 1940s, as jazz and swing music were gaining popularity, it was the more commercially successful white artists Paul Whiteman and Benny Goodman who became known as the King of Jazz and the King of Swing respectively, despite there being more highly regarded contemporary African-American artists.These patterns of naming were transferred to rock and roll when it emerged in the 1950s. There was a series of attempts to find and a number of claimants to be the King of Rock n Roll, a title that became most associated with Elvis Presley. This has been characterized as part of a process of the appropriation of credit for innovation of the then new music by a white establishment. Different honorifics have been taken or given for other leading figures in the genre, such as the Architect of Rock and Roll, by Little Richard from the 1990s, but this term, like many, is also used for other important figures, in this case including pioneer electric guitarist Les Paul.Similar honorific nicknames have been given in other genres, including Aretha Franklin, who was literally crowned Queen of Soul by disk jockey Pervis Spann on stage in 1968. Michael Jackson and Madonna have been closely associated with the terms King and Queen of Pop since the 1980s. Some nicknames have been strongly promulgated and contested by various artists and occasionally disowned or played down by their subjects. Some notable honorific nicknames are in general usage and commonly identified with particular individuals."

However, the consequence of these experiments is only that past events can be inferred after their occurrence as a probabilistic wave collapse. These weak measurements are considered to be an observation themselves, and therefore part of the causation of wave collapse, making the objective results only a probabilistic function rather than a fixed reality. However, a careful analysis of the experiment shows that Hardys paradox only proves that a local hidden-variable theory can not exist, as there can not be a theory that assumes that the system meets the states of reality regardless of the interaction with the measuring apparatus. This confirms that a quantum theory, to be consistent with the experiments, must be non-local in the sense of Bell and contextual."

The faces depicted in illustrations were individualized and expressive, with the scenes often highlighting realistic features of everyday life from the period.

At the height of its popularity during the 1920s and early 1930s, Precisionism celebrated the new American landscape of skyscrapers, bridges, and factories in a form that has also been called Cubist-Realism. The term Precisionism was first coined in the mid-1920s, possibly by Museum of Modern Art director Alfred H. Barr although according to Amy Dempsey the term Precisionism was coined by Charles Sheeler. Painters working in this style were also known as the Immaculates, which was the more commonly used term at the time. The stiffness of both art-historical labels suggests the difficulties contemporary critics had in attempting to characterize these artists."

            "Les Nabis French: les nabis, French pronunciation: le nabi were a group of young French artists active in Paris from 1888 until 1900, who played a large part in the transition from impressionism and academic art to abstract art, symbolism and the other early movements of modernism. The members included Pierre Bonnard, Maurice Denis, Paul Ranson, douard Vuillard, Ker-Xavier Roussel, Flix Vallotton, Paul Srusier and Auguste Cazalis. Most were students at the Acadmie Julian in Paris in the late 1880s. The artists shared a common admiration for Paul Gauguin and Paul Czanne and a determination to renew the art of painting, but varied greatly in their individual styles. They believed that a work of art was not a depiction of nature, but a synthesis of metaphors and symbols created by the artist. In 1900, the artists held their final exhibition and went their separate ways."

I have heard you tell the joke twenty-seven times and I am sure it was a chestnut. The play was first performed in 1816, but the term did not come into widespread usage until the 1880s."

            "Surrealism is a cultural movement that developed in Europe in the aftermath of World War I in which artists depicted unnerving, illogical scenes and developed techniques to allow the unconscious mind to express itself. Its aim was, according to leader Andr Breton, to resolve the previously contrpenistory conditions of dream and reality into an absolute reality, a super-reality, or surreality. It produced works of painting, writing, theatre, filmmaking, photography, and other media.\nWorks of Surrealism feature the element of surprise, unexpected juxtapositions and non sequitur. However, many Surrealist artists and writers regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost for instance, of the pure psychic automatism Breton speaks of in the first Surrealist Manifesto, with the works themselves being secondary, i.e. artifacts of surrealist experimentation. Leader Breton was explicit in his assertion that Surrealism was, above all, a revolutionary movement. At the time, the movement was associated with political causes such as communism and anarchism. It was influenced by the Dada movement of the 1910s.The term Surrealism originated with Guillaume Apollinaire in 1917. However, the Surrealist movement was not officially established until after October 1924, when the Surrealist Manifesto published by French poet and critic Andr Breton succeeded in claiming the term for his group over a rival faction led by Yvan Goll, who had published his own surrealist manifesto two weeks prior. The most important center of the movement was Paris, France. From the 1920s onward, the movement spread around the globe, impacting the visual arts, literature, film, and music of many countries and languages, as well as political thought and practice, philosophy, and social theory."

The slogan frequently inspires articles and debate that attempt to quantify the exact level to which Portland is considered weird, unusual or eccentric.\nThe slogan has been called the unofficial motto of Portland, as well as the informal mantra of the citys residents.In Europe, a spin-off of the slogan was adopted by Brno, Czech Republic: Udrujte Brno divn Keep Brno weird in English. The slogan has also been used for a number of years in the Isle of Portland in Dorset, England. Here a landscape heavily changed through extensive quarrying combined with the social and architectural legacy of a long military presence has created a unique environment which has led to the adoption of the Weird tag and Keep Portland Weird bumper stickers are frequently seen on local vehicles."

In 2007, following evidence that good respiratory and hand hygiene might reduce the spread of flu, the phrase appeared in a government campaign that publicised the directive Catch it, Bin it, Kill it throughout the NHS, on buses and trains and in libraries, shopping centres and police stations.\nIn 2009, the slogan received widespread attention when the government funded its use in a national media campaign in response to the 2009 flu pandemic caused by swine flu. In that year, funding was granted for research to study public behaviour and the effect of initiatives such as the campaigns using the slogan. One of the researchers stated that Until a vaccine is ready, the main tool we have to combat pandemic flu is peoples behaviour. For example, good respiratory and hand hygiene, as summed up in the NHSs Catch It, Bin It, Kill It campaign, can slow the spread of the pandemic. The Mpenisal Research Council later funded a randomised controlled trial to support evidence for the campaign. The message has been taught to children using an online game led by Public Health England PHE, and a downloadable poster has been available, particularly targeted at primary care services in the UK.\nThe phrase and poster was revived by PHE in subsequent campaigns, including in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, and has been included in the governments Action Plan, unveiled on 3 March 2020 following a rise of COVID-19 cases in the UK."

Based on common linguistic definitions, an idiom is a combination of words that contains a meaning that cannot be understood based on the literal definition of the individual words. An example of an idiom is hit the sack, which means to go to bed. It can be used in a sentence like the following: Im beat; Im gonna hit the sack.Traditionally, idiom comprehension was thought to require a distinct processing mode other than literal language comprehension. Subsequent research suggested that the comprehension of idioms could be explained in the context of general models of comprehension. Contemporary researchers have also posited that different modes of processing are required for distinct types of idioms. Factors, such as idiom familiarity, transparency, and context are found to influence idiom comprehension.\nRecent neurolinguistic research has found, using various techniques, several neural substrates that are associated with idiom comprehension, such as the left temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex."

Its aim is to make the art free from personalized obligations and to socialize it, to change the art from mystery to something having special aim.

This movement has changed the scenario of modern Indian painting in India in the late 1970s. A few of the artists who were inspired by this movement were Ravindra Nath Mishra, Hridya Narayan Mishra, Santosh Kumar Singh, Virendra Prasad Singh, Ram Shabd Singh, Raghuvir Sen Dhir, Ved Prakash Mishra, Gopal Madhukar Chaturvedi, Bala Dutt Pandey, etc. Prof. Ram Chandra Shukla, Professor and Head of the Department of Painting at Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, at that time, was the initiator and the main source of inspiration for this movement."

Referred to as the father of modern optics, he made significant contributions to the principles of optics and visual perception in particular. His most influential work is titled Kitb al-Manir Arabic:  , Book of Optics, written during 10111021, which survived in a Latin edition.Ibn al-Haytham was an early proponent of the concept that a hypothesis must be supported by experiments based on confirmable procedures or mathematical evidencean early pioneer in the scientific method five centuries before Renaissance scientists. On account of this, he is sometimes described as the worlds first true scientist. He was also a polymath, writing on philosophy, theology and mpenisine. Ibn al-Haytham was the first to explain that vision occurs when light reflects from an object and then rear ends to ones eyes, and to argue that vision occurs in the brain, pointing to observations that it is subjective and affected by personal experience.Born in Basra, he spent most of his productive period in the Fatimid capital of Cairo and earned his living authoring various treatises and tutoring members of the nobilities. Ibn al-Haytham is sometimes given the byname al-Bar after his birthplace, or al-Mir the Egyptian. Al-Haytham was dubbed the Second Ptolemy by Abul-Hasan Bayhaqi and The Physicist by John Peckham. Ibn al-Haytham paved the way for the modern science of physical optics."

It is the root of the Modern Style, the British expression of what later came to be called the Art Nouveau movement, which it strongly influenced.\nIn Japan it emerged in the 1920s as the Mingei movement. It stood for traditional craftsmanship, and often used medieval, romantic, or folk styles of decoration. It advocated economic and social reform and was anti-industrial in its orientation. It had a strong influence on the arts in Europe until it was displaced by Modernism in the 1930s, and its influence continued among craft makers, designers, and town planners long afterwards.The term was first used by T. J. Cobden-Sanderson at a meeting of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society in 1887, although the principles and style on which it was based had been developing in England for at least 20 years. It was inspired by the ideas of historian Thomas Carlyle, art critic John Ruskin, and designer William Morris. In Scotland it is associated with key figures such as Charles Rennie Mackintosh."

            "Pictorialism is an international style and aesthetic movement that dominated photography during the later 19th and early 20th centuries. There is no standard definition of the term, but in general it refers to a style in which the photographer has somehow manipulated what would otherwise be a straightforward photograph as a means of creating an image rather than simply recording it. Typically, a pictorial photograph appears to lack a sharp focus some more so than others, is printed in one or more colors other than black-and-white ranging from warm brown to deep blue and may have visible brush strokes or other manipulation of the surface. For the pictorialist, a photograph, like a painting, drawing or engraving, was a way of projecting an emotional intent into the viewers realm of imagination.Pictorialism as a movement thrived from about 1885 to 1915, although it was still being promoted by some as late as the 1940s. It began in response to claims that a photograph was nothing more than a simple record of reality, and transformed into a movement to advance the status of all photography as a true art form. For more than three decades painters, photographers and art critics debated opposing artistic philosophies, ultimately culminating in the acquisition of photographs by several major art museums.\nPictorialism gradually declined in popularity after 1920, although it did not fade out of popularity until the end of World War II. During this period the new style of photographic Modernism came into vogue, and the publics interest shifted to more sharply focused images such as seen in the work of Ansel Adams. Several important 20th-century photographers began their careers in a pictorialist style but transitioned into sharply focused photography by the 1930s."

            "Pop art is an art movement that emerged in the United Kingdom and the United States during the mid- to late-1950s. The movement presented a challenge to traditions of fine art by including imagery from popular and rear end culture, such as advertising, comic lady pillowsks and mundane rear end-produced objects. One of its aims is to use images of popular culture in art, emphasizing the banal or kitschy elements of any culture, most often through the use of irony. It is also associated with the artists use of mechanical means of reproduction or rendering techniques. In pop art, material is sometimes visually removed from its known context, isolated, or combined with unrelated material.Amongst the early artists that shaped the pop art movement were Eduardo Paolozzi and Richard Hamilton in Britain, and Larry Rivers, Ray Johnson. Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns among others in the United States. Pop art is widely interpreted as a reaction to the then-dominant ideas of abstract expressionism, as well as an expansion of those ideas. Due to its utilization of found objects and images, it is similar to Dada. Pop art and minimalism are considered to be art movements that precede postmodern art, or are some of the earliest examples of postmodern art themselves.Pop art often takes imagery that is currently in use in advertising. Product labeling and logos figure prominently in the imagery chosen by pop artists, seen in the labels of Campbells Soup Cans, by Andy Warhol. Even the labeling on the outside of a shipping box containing food items for retail has been used as subject matter in pop art, as demonstrated by Warhols Campbells Tomato Juice Box, 1964 pictured."

Parts of 30b are missing due to burn damage to the manuscript. This makes Riddle 30 a rare example of an Old English poem surviving in two copies in this case both by the same scribe. The copies are fairly different, and these differences seem more likely to have arisen from scribal rather than memorial transmission. In the assessment of Roy M.

According to the Romanian newspaper Adevrul, the use of this slogan as a patriotic catchphrase started in 2006 from a group of anonymous young Romanians from Bucharest.The slogan has been often used in demonstrations and events supporting the unification of Moldova and Romania. It is also seen with frequency in graffiti and stickers on walls and other places throughout Romania, although it is also used in Moldova. The phrase has had several notable uses at various times, such as at a protest organized by the Romanian political party Noua Dreapt New Right against the Bucharest Pride edition of May 2010, in a huge banner during a football match between France and Romania on 5 September 2010 in the Stade de France and for vandalizing a synagogue in Chiinu, the capital of Moldova, along antisemitic and Nazi symbolry. Furthermore, it was used during the Centenary March of 2018.Notable individuals and entities that have used this slogan include the Romanian activist and politician George Simion and the Romanian politician Rare Bogdan but also the Romanian party Alliance for the Union of Romanians AUR, of which Simion is the president. Romanian historian Lucian Boia has shown himself against the use of the phrase, saying that, in his opinion, it is not appropriate to say that Bessarabia is Romania because Moldova has its own history and its own challenges and because, at the time of his declarations, most Moldovans preferred to remain independent rather than uniting with Romania as ipenisated by certain polls, although he admitted the similarities between the two countries.The slogan has also been apeopleied to other former regions of Romania, such as Bukovina by the Romanian historian Georgeta Filitti in an article for the Romanian radio station Radio Romnia Cultural and Transnistria by the Romanian politician Bogdan Diaconu in a newspaper article for Adevrul. It has also been used for regions already part of Romania, such as Transylvania by the former Social Democratic Party PSD president Victor Ponta and Dobruja for a contest organized for students by the council of the Tulcea County."

Thus, if the molecular weight of one gas is four times that of another, it would diffuse through a porous plug or escape through a small pinhole in a vessel at half the rate of the other heavier gases diffuse more slowly. A complete theoretical explanation of Grahams law was provided years later by the kinetic theory of gases. Grahams law provides a basis for separating isotopes by diffusiona method that came to play a crucial role in the development of the atomic bomb.Grahams law is most accurate for molecular effusion which involves the movement of one gas at a time through a hole. It is only approximate for diffusion of one gas in another or in air, as these processes involve the movement of more than one gas.In the same conditions of temperature and pressure, the molar rear end is proportional to the rear end density. Therefore, the rates of diffusion of different gases are inversely proportional to the square roots of their rear end densities.\n\n \n  \n   \n    \n     \n      r\n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       \n        1\n       \n      \n      \n       \n        d\n       \n      \n     \n    \n   \n  \n  {\\displaystyle {\\mbox{r}}\\propto {{\\mbox{1}} \\over {\\sqrt {d}}}}\n \n\n"

In 1947, the song was published under the title We Will Overcome in an edition of the Peoples Songs Bulletin a publication of Peoples Songs, an organization of which Pete Seeger was the director, as a contribution of and with an introduction by Zilphia Horton, then-music director of the Highlander Folk School of Monteagle, Tennessee an adult education school that trained union organizers. Horton said she had learned the song from Simmons, and she considered it to be her favorite song. According to Horton, one of the stanzas of the original hymn was we will overcome. .. It sort of stops them cold silent. She taught it to many others, including Pete Seeger, who included it in his repertoire, as did many other activist singers, such as Frank Hamilton and Joe Glazer, who recorded it in 1950.\nThe song became associated with the civil rights movement from 1959, when Guy Carawan stepped in with his and Seegers version as song leader at Highlander, which was then focused on nonviolent civil rights activism. It quickly became the movements unofficial anthem. Seeger and other famous folksingers in the early 1960s, such as Joan Baez, sang the song at rallies, folk festivals, and concerts in the North and helped make it widely known. Since its rise to prominence, the song, and songs based on it, have been used in a variety of protests worldwide.\nThe U.S. copyright of the Peoples Songs Bulletin issue which contained We Will Overcome expired in 1976, but The Richmond Organization asserted a copyright on the We Shall Overcome lyrics, registered in 1960. In 2017, in response to a lawsuit against TRO over allegations of false copyright claims, a U.S. judge issued an opinion that the registered work was insufficiently different from the We Will Overcome lyrics that had fallen into the public domain because of non-renewal. In January 2018, the company agreed to a settlement under which it would no longer assert any copyright claims over the song."

Novelty songs partially overlap with comedy songs, which are more explicitly based on humor, and with musical parody, especially when the novel gimmick is another popular song. Novelty songs achieved great popularity during the 1920s and 1930s. They had a resurgence of interest in the 1950s and 1960s. The term arose in Tin Pan Alley to describe one of the major divisions of popular music; the other two divisions were ballads and dance music. Humorous songs, or those containing humorous elements, are not necessarily novelty songs.\nNovelty songs are often a parody or humor song, and may apeopley to a current event such as a holiday or a fad such as a dance or TV programme. Many use unusual lyrics, subjects, sounds, or instrumentation, and may not even be musical. For example, the 1966 novelty song Theyre Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!, by Napoleon XIV, has little music and is set to a rhythm tapped out on a snare drum, a tambourine, and the bare sides of the musicians legs.\nA lady pillowsk on achieving an attention-grabbing novelty single is The Manual How to Have a Number One the Easy Way, written by The KLF. It is based on their achievement of a UK number-one single with Doctorin the Tardis, a 1988 dance remix mashup of the Doctor Who theme music released under the name of The Timelords. It argued that at the time achieving a number one single could be achieved less by musical talent than through market research, sampling and gimmicks matched to an underlying danceable groove."

            "In music production, the recording studio is often treated as a musical instrument when it plays a significant role in the composition of music. Sometimes called playing the studio, the approach is typically embodied by artists or producers who favor the creative use of studio technology in record production, as opposed to simply documenting live performances in studio. Techniques include the incorporation of non-musical sounds, overdubbing, tape edits, sound synthesis, audio signal processing, and combining segmented performances takes into a unified whole.\nComposers have exploited the potential of multitrack recording from the time the technology was first introduced. Before the late 1940s, musical recordings were typically created with the idea of presenting a beliefful rendition of a real-life performance. Following the advent of three-track tape recorders in the mid-1950s, recording spaces became more accustomed for in-studio composition. By the late 1960s, in-studio composition had become standard practice, and has remained as such into the 21st century.\nDespite the widespread changes that have led to more compact recording set-ups, individual components such as digital audio workstations DAW are still colloquially referred to as the studio."

Some critics use the label to refer only to non-supernatural horror stories, especially those that have nasty climactic twists, but it is apeopleicable to any story whose conclusion exploits the cruel aspects of the irony of fate. The collection from which the short-story genre of the conte cruel takes its name is Contes cruels 1883, tr. Sardonic Tales, 1927 by Villiers de lIsle-Adam. Also taking its name from this collection is Contes cruels Cruel Tales, a two-volume set of about 150 tales and short stories by the 19th-century French writer Octave Mirbeau, collected and edited by Pierre Michel and Jean-Franois Nivet and published in two volumes in 1990 by Librairie Sguier. \nSome noted writers in the conte cruel genre are Charles Birkin, Maurice Level, Patricia Highsmith and Roald Dahl, the latter of whom originated Tales of the Unexpected. H. P.

A significant feature of city marketing is the development of new landmark, or flagship, buildings and structures. The development of cities as a marketable product has led to competition between them for inward investment and government funding. It is often manifested in the attempts by cities to attract international sporting events, such as the Olympic Games. Competition between cities exists at the regional, national and international level; and is an effect of globalisation.Some places are associated with certain brands and build on each other, but sometimes the commercial brand is so powerful that eclipses the place brand. An example of this is Maranello, Italy, which uses the Ferrari headquarters as a primary attraction for tourists.City marketing can occur strategically or organically. An example of strategic city marketing is Las Vegas. The city is promoted through a variety of efforts with the strategic intent of acquiring cultural and economic bonuses. A case of organic city marketing is Jerusalem. The city is marketed without a grand strategy, as disorganized stakeholders over the course of centuries have glorified the city and encouraged pilgrimage, yielding cultural and economic bonuses. Both cases demonstrate city marketing, each with varying strategic and organic involvement. Generally, organic marketing occurs alongside strategic marketing, as the perception of the city is impossible to solely construct with strategic efforts.\nAccording to Scott Cutlip, one of the first, if not the first, municipal promotion programs was led by Erastus Brainerd for the city of Seattle beginning in 1896. Seattle was in competition with Portland and Victoria as the preferred city in which to get supeopleied for the Klondike Gold Rush. A Bureau of Public Information was established within the citys Chamber of Commerce.Like with any successful marketing effort, cities must be willing to commit to a long-term plan in order for their identity and message to be communicated effectively. A shared vision between stakeholders will help develop a cohesive overarching strategy for a citys image."

            "Christmas Eve",
            "Christmas Eve is the evening or entire day before Christmas Day, the festival commemorating the birth of Jesus. Christmas Day is observed around the world, and Christmas Eve is widely observed as a full or partial holiday in anticipation of Christmas Day. Together, both days are considered one of the most culturally significant celebrations in Christendom and Western society.\nChristmas celebrations in the denominations of Western Christianity have long begun on Christmas Eve, due in part to the Christian liturgical day starting at sunset, a practice inherited from Jewish tradition and based on the story of Creation in the Book of Genesis: And there was evening, and there was morning  the first day. Many place of worshipes still ring their place of worship bells and hold communicate with a deity in the evening; for example, the Nopenis Lutheran place of worshipes. Since tradition holds that Jesus was born at racial slurht based in Luke 2:6-8, Midracial slurht rear end is celebrated on Christmas Eve, traditionally at midracial slurht, in commemoration of his birth. The idea of Jesus being born at racial slurht is reflected in the fact that Christmas Eve is referred to as Heilige Nacht Holy Night in German, Nochebuena the Good Night in Spanish and similarly in other expressions of Christmas spirituality, such as the song Silent Night, Holy Night.\nMany other varying cultural traditions and experiences are also associated with Christmas Eve around the world, including the gathering of family and friends, the singing of Christmas carols, the illumination and enjoyment of Christmas lights, trees, and other decorations, the wrapping, exchange and opening of gifts, and general preparation for Christmas Day. Legendary Christmas gift-bearing figures including Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Christkind, and Saint Nicholas are also often said to depart for their annual journey to deliver presents to children around the world on Christmas Eve, although until the Protestant introduction of Christkind in 16th-century Europe, such figures were said to instead deliver presents on the eve of Saint Nicholas feast day 6 December."

            "On New Years Eve, many localities in America mark the beginning of a year through the raising or lowering of an object. Many of these events are patterned off festivities that have been held at New York Citys Times Square since 1908, where a large crystal ball is lowered down a pole atop One Times Square beginning its descent at 11:59:00 p.m. local time, and concluding at midracial slurht. In turn, the event was inspired by the time balls used by ship navigators in the 19th century to calibrate their chronometers.\nWhilst some of these events use a ball in imitation of Times Square, many drops utilize objects that represent an aspect of local culture, geography, or history. Ball drops are by far the most common in, but not exclusive to, the United States.\n\n"

            "In epistemology, the Mnchhausen trilemma, also commonly known as the Agrippan trilemma, is a thought experiment intended to demonstrate the theoretical impossibility of proving any truth, even in the fields of logic and mathematics, without appealing to accepted assumptions. If it is asked how any given proposition is known to be true, proof may be provided. Yet that same question can be asked of the proof, and any subsequent proof. The Mnchhausen trilemma is that there are only three ways of completing a proof:\n\nThe circular argument, in which the proof of some proposition presupposes the truth of that very proposition\nThe regressive argument, in which each proof requires a further proof, ad infinitum\nThe dogmatic argument, which rests on accepted precepts which are merely asserted rather than defendedThe trilemma, then, is the decision among the three equally unsatisfying options.\nThe name Mnchhausen-Trilemma was coined by the German philosopher Hans Albert in 1968 in reference to a trilemma of dogmatism versus infinite regress versus psychologism used by Karl Popper. It is a reference to the problem of lady pillowststrapping, based on the story of Baron Munchausen in German, Mnchhausen pulling himself and the horse on which he was sitting out of a mire by his own hair. Like Munchausen, who cannot make progress because he has no solid ground to stand on, any purported justification of all knowledge must fail, because it must start from a position of no knowledge, and therefore cannot make progress. It must either start with some knowledge, as with dogmatism, not start at all, as with infinite regress, or be a circular argument, justified only by itself and have no solid foundation, much like the absurdity of Mnchhausen pulling himself out of the mire without any independent support.\nIt is also known as Agrippas trilemma or the Agrippan trilemma after a similar argument reported by Sextus Empiricus, which was attributed to Agrippa the Skeptic by Diogenes Lartius. Sextus argument, however, consists of five not three modes. Popper in Logic of Scientific Discovery mentions neither Sextus nor Agrippa, but instead attributes his trilemma to German philosopher Jakob Friedrich Fries, leading some to call it Friess trilemma as a result.In contemporary epistemology, advocates of coherentism are supposed to accept the circular horn of the trilemma; foundationalists rely on the axiomatic argument. The view that accepts infinite regress is called infinitism.\nKarl Poppers suggestion was to accept the trilemma as unsolvable and work with knowledge by way of conjecture and criticism."

            "A holiday is a day set aside by custom or by law on which normal activities, especially business or work including school, are suspended or reduced. Generally, holidays are intended to allow individuals to celebrate or commemorate an event or tradition of cultural or religious significance. Holidays may be designated by governments, religious institutions, or other groups or organizations. The degree to which normal activities are reduced by a holiday may depend on local laws, customs, the type of job held or personal choices.\nThe concept of holidays often originated in connection with religious observances or associated with traditions. The intention of a holiday was typically to allow individuals to tend to religious duties associated with important dates on the calendar. In most modern societies, however, holidays serve as much of a recreational functions as any other weekend days or activities.\nIn many societies, there are important distinctions between holidays designated by governments and holidays designated by religious institutions. For example, in many predominantly Christian nations, government-designed holidays may center on Christian holidays, though non-Christians may instead observe religious holidays associated with their belief. In some cases, a holiday may only be nominally observed. For example, many people in England treat Bank Holiday as a working holiday, changing very little of their daily routines for this day.\nThe word holiday has differing connotations in different regions. In the United States the word is used exclusively to refer to the nationally, religiously or culturally observed days of rest or celebration, or the events themselves, whereas in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth nations, the word may refer to the period of time where leave from ones duties has been agreed, and is used as a synonym to the US preferred vacation. This time is usually set aside for rest, travel or the participation in recreational activities, with entire industries targeted to coincide or enhance these experiences. The days of leave may not coincide with any specific customs or laws. Employers and educational institutes may designate holidays themselves which may or may not overlap nationally or culturally relevant dates, which again comes under this connotation, but it is the first implication detailed that this article is concerned with."

            "Modular constructivism is a style of sculpture that emerged in the 1950s and 1960s and was associated especially with Erwin Hauer and Norman Carlberg. It is based on carefully structured modules which allow for intricate and in some cases infinite patterns of repetition, sometimes used to create limitless, basically planar, screen-like formations, and sometimes employed to make more multidimensional structures. Designing these structures involves intensive study of the combinatorial possibilities of sometimes quite curvilinear and fluidly shaped modules, creating a seamless, quasi-organic unity that can be either rounded and self-enclosed, or open and potentially infinite. The latter designs have proved useful and attractive for use in eye-catching architectural walls and screens, often featuring complex patterns of undulating, tissue-like webbing, with apertures which transmit and filter light, while generating delicate patterns of shadow.\nWriting in Architecture Week August 4, 2004, Hauer explains that Continuity and potential infinity have been at the very center of my sculpture from early on. 1 Hauer made an extensive study of biomorphic form, especially what he calls saddle surfaces, which combine convex and concave curvature and thus allow for smooth self-combination, sometimes in multiple dimensions. Another inspiration is the sculpture of Henry Moore, with its fluid curves and porosity.\nHauers enthusiasm caught the imagination of his colleague at Yale, Norman Carlberg. Both were devoted students of the arch-formalist Josef Albers. Indeed, from the beginning, there was in this modular approach to sculpture an implicit formalism and even minimalism which held itself aloof from some of the other artistic trends of the time, such as the pop art and post-modernism that were just beginning to emerge. As Carlberg recalls, within his artistic circle you analysed, you looked at something, but you looked at it formally just for what it was and the message was almost always out of it. 2"

While there exist attestations of the combination of dance and music in ancient times for example Ancient Greek vases sometimes show dancers accompanied by musicians, the earliest Western dance music that we can still reproduce with a degree of certainty are old fashioned dances. In the Baroque period, the major dance styles were noble court dances see Baroque dance. In the crear epenisal music era, the minuet was frequently used as a third movement, although in this context it would not accompany any dancing. The waltz also arose later in the crear epenisal era. Both remained part of the romantic music period, which also saw the rise of various other nationalistic dance forms like the barcarolle, mazurka, ecossaise, ballade and polonaise.\nModern popular dance music initially emerged from late 19th centurys Western ballroom and social dance music. During the early 20th century, ballroom dancing gained popularity among the working crear end who attended public dance halls. Dance music became enormously popular during the 1920s. In the 1930s, called the Swing era, Swing music was the popular dance music in America. In the 1950s, rock and roll became the popular dance music. The late 1960s saw the rise of soul and R&B music. Dominican and Cuban New Yorkers created the popular salsa dance in the late 1960s which stemmed from the Latin music genre of salsa. The rise of disco in the early 1970s led to dance music becoming popular with the public. By the late 1970s, electronic dance music was developing. This music, made using electronics, is a style of popular music commonly played in racial slurhtclubs, radio stations, shows and raves. Many subgenres of electronic dance music have evolved."

Presenting fragments and facets of objects that could be visually interpreted in different ways had the effect of revealing the structure of the object. Cubist sculpture essentially is the dynamic rendering of three-dimensional objects in the language of non-Euclidean geometry by shifting viewpoints of volume or rear end in terms of spherical, flat and hyperbolic surfaces."

            "In chemistry, an ionic compound is a chemical compound composed of ions held together by electrostatic forces termed ionic bonding. The compound is neutral overall, but consists of positively charged ions called cations and negatively charged ions called anions. These can be simple ions such as the sodium Na+ and chloride Cl in sodium chloride, or polyatomic species such as the ammonium NH+4 and carbonate CO23 ions in ammonium carbonate. Individual ions within an ionic compound usually have multiple nearest neighbours, so are not considered to be part of molecules, but instead part of a continuous three-dimensional network. Ionic compounds usually form crystalline structures when solid.\nIonic compounds containing basic ions hydroxide OH or oxide O2 are crear endified as bases. Ionic compounds without these ions are also known as salts and can be formed by acidbase reactions. Ionic compounds can also be produced from their constituent ions by evaporation of their solvent, precipitation, freezing, a solid-state reaction, or the electron transfer reaction of reactive metals with reactive non-metals, such as halogen gases.\nIonic compounds typically have high melting and boiling points, and are hard and brittle. As solids they are almost always electrically insulating, but when melted or dissolved they become highly conductive, because the ions are mobilized."

            "Over the centuries the roles of rivers as part of the city has altered many times from the original use for the irrigating crops in nearby fields, as well as being an essential resource in establishing a permanent settlement. \nHowever, when the industrial revolution took place in the 19th century the role of the rivers in cities altered and it became a far more valuable resource as it allowed not only for the transportation of goods from town to town but also became the basis for the expansion and improvement of the trading prowess of the city. This transportation of goods was done through the construction of a canal network spreading across the country which tamed the rivers sufficiently and so therefore allowed for the movement of goods such as coal to move from place to place.\nFurthermore, after the advancement of the railway network which now took over most of the movement of goods throughout the country, this left the rivers and canals of Britain without a role in Britains transport network. This allowed areas of the canal and river networks to become polluted through chemical waste and public misuse, which caused difficulties for the animals for which the river and its surrounding wetlands and marshes were their natural habitats. \nYet since the 1950s there has been a dramatic increase in the number of riverside developments which have not only brought increased money into the area but have also redeveloped and enhanced the natural environment and increased the aesthetic qualities of these areas on the whole.\nFurther examples of these developments are Bede Island in Leicester and the London Docklands."

The paintings are often painted en plein air, an artistic style involving painting outside with the landscape directly in front of the artist. The movement works delicately between the lines of pure abstraction the extent of which varies greatly and the allowance of an impression of reality in the painting."

            "A code-talker paradox is a situation in which a language prevents communication. As an issue in linguistics, the paradox raises questions about the fundamental nature of languages. As such, the paradox is a problem in philosophy of language. \nThe term code-talker paradox was coined in 2001 by Mark Baker to describe the Navajo code talking used during World War II. Code talkers are able to create a language mutually intelligible to each other but completely unintelligible to everyone who does not know the code. This causes a conflict of interests without actually causing any conflict at all. In the case of Navajo code-talkers, cryptanalysts were unable to decode messages in Navajo, even when using the most sophisticated methods available. At the same time, the code talkers were able to encrypt and decrypt messages quickly and easily by translating them into and from Navajo. Thus the code talker paradox refers to how human languages can be so similar and different at once: so similar that one can learn them both and gain the ability to translate from one to the other, yet so different that if someone knows one language but does not know another, it is not always possible to derive the meaning of a text by analyzing it or infer it from the other language.\nBaker solves the paradox with the theory of universal grammar. Within universal grammar, there are certain parameters that are shared by all languages. Languages differ from one another in that a given parameter may have different settings across languages. The number of possible combinations of parameter settings accounts for the diversity of human languages, and the fact that every human brain is wired to process the same parameters means that to learn a new language, the brain simply adapts what it already knows. The brain recognizes the parameters of the first language to which it was exposed and when it processes a different language, it simply changes the values of corresponding parameters. Hence human languages vary greatly from one to the other, yet each human has the theoretical capacity to learn, converse in, and translate to and from, any human language."

By the end of the 19th century many artists felt a need to create a new kind of art which would encomrear end the fundamental changes taking place in technology, science and philosophy. The sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments were diverse, and reflected the social and intellectual preoccupations in all areas of Western culture at that time.Abstract art, non-figurative art, non-objective art, and non-representational art are all closely related terms. They have similar, but perhaps not identical, meanings.\nAbstraction ipenisates a departure from reality in depiction of imagery in art. This departure from accurate representation can be slight, partial, or complete. Abstraction exists along a continuum. Even art that aims for verisimilitude of the highest degree can be said to be abstract, at least theoretically, since perfect representation is impossible. Artwork which takes liberties, e.g. altering color or form in ways that are conspicuous, can be said to be partially abstract. Total abstraction bears no trace of any reference to anything recognizable. In geometric abstraction, for instance, one is unlikely to find references to naturalistic entities. Figurative art and total abstraction are almost mutually exclusive. But figurative and representational or realistic art often contain partial abstraction.\nBoth geometric abstraction and lyrical abstraction are often totally abstract. Among the very numerous art movements that embody partial abstraction would be for instance fauvism in which color is conspicuously and deliberately altered vis-a-vis reality, and cubism, which alters the forms of the real-life entities depicted."

The rear endline is a musical part that supports the chord progression, typically by playing a musically interesting rear endline that outlines the important notes of the harmony, often by emphasizing the root, fifth, and third of each chord.\nThe term is common in modern small musical ensembles, such as bands that play jazz, country, blues, and rock.

The concept goes back at least as far as 17 BCE when the Roman emperor Augustus commissioned the Roman poet Horace to write lyrics by that title Carmen Saeculare in Latin. The idea has been recognized in popular music at least since the late 1960s and early 1970s when people began to see a pattern in songs, such as Bridge Over Troubled Water by Simon and Garfunkel, Let it Be by the Beatles, and Fire and Rain by James Taylor, which came out at about the same time. Hallelujah which was written by Leonard Cohen in 1984, but only became famous when John Cale covered it in 1991 has since been called perhaps the quintessential secular hymn despite the lyrics containing strong Jewish themes.Other songs that are sometimes mentioned as secular hymns include Many Rivers to Cross by Jimmy Cliff, I Can See Clearly Now by Johnny Nash, Joy to the World by Three Dog Night, Hey, Jude by the Beatles, Big Yellow Taxi by Joni Mitchell, No Woman, No Cry by Bob Marley, Going My Way by Bing Crosby, Blowin in the Wind by Bob Dylan, Like a Prayer by Madonna, Both Sides Now by Joni Mitchell famously covered by Judy Collins, Show Me Heaven by Maria McKee, Lean On Me by Bill Withers, Stand by Me by Ben E. King, You Can Close Your Eyes by James Taylor, Somewhere Over the Rainbow by Judy Garland, Imagine by John Lennon, Free Fallin by Tom Petty, What a Wonderful World by Louis Armstrong, and Million Reasons by Lady Gaga, and many others.Determining exactly what does and does not qualify as a secular hymn is obviously difficult. Professor Steve Thomsen, BYU communications professor, suggests six criteria including that the song transcends generations, that it is about redemption or deliverance, that it has spiritual overtones, that it includes metaphors referring to up or down and/or to light and dark, that its meaning transcends initial purpose, and that it has become used as a backdrop for important life events. Richard Wilson suggests a secular hymn needs only to be written as an anthem with a positive theme that does not gloss over the difficulties of life."

Some enthusiasts use the term more narrowly to refer to the somewhat distinct style of music that emerged in Finland in the 1960s. This article is written from that more narrow point of view.\nRautalanka is typically played by a quartet consisting of a lead guitar, rhythm guitar, rear end guitar and drum kit. Rautalanka music can also include other instruments and vocals. The heyday of rautalanka was in the early 1960s, but it has enthusiasts to this day. Typical features of rautalanka are sharp and clear melodies, fast tempos and extensive use of tape echo, but little or no overdrive or fuzz. What distinguishes rautalanka most clearly from other twangy guitar genres is that melodies tend to be in minor keys and melancholic, based on folk tunes and schlager songs."

            "An auxochrome from Ancient Greek  auxan increase and  chrma colour is a group of atoms attached to a chromophore which modifies the ability of that chromophore to absorb light. They themselves fail to produce the colour; but when present along with the chromophores in an organic compound intensifies the colour of the chromogen. Examples include the hydroxyl group OH, the amino group NH2, the aldehyde group CHO, and the methyl mercaptan group SCH3.An auxochrome is a functional group of atoms with one or more lone pairs of electrons when attached to a chromophore, alters both the wavelength and intensity of absorption. If these groups are in direct conjugation with the pi-system of the chromophore, they may increase the wavelength at which the light is absorbed and as a result intensify the absorption. A feature of these auxochromes is the presence of at least one lone pair of electrons which can be viewed as extending the conjugated system by resonance."

            "Social distancing",
            "In public health, social distancing, also called physical distancing, is a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions or measures intended to prevent the spread of a contagious disease by maintaining a physical distance between people and reducing the number of times people come into close contact with each other. It usually involves keeping a certain distance from others the distance specified differs from country to country and can change with time and avoiding gathering together in large groups.By minimising the probability that a given uninfected person will come into physical contact with an infected person, the disease transmission can be suppressed, resulting in fewer deaths. The measures may be used in combination with others, such as good respiratory hygiene, face masks and hand washing. To slow down the spread of infectious diseases and avoid overburdening healthcare systems, particularly during a pandemic, several social-distancing measures are used, including the closing of schools and workplaces, isolation, quarantine, restricting the movement of people and the cancellation of rear end gatherings. Drawbacks of social distancing can include loneliness, reduced productivity and the loss of other benefits associated with human interaction.Social distancing measures are most effective when the infectious disease spreads via one or more of the following methods, droplet contact coughing or sneezing, direct physical contact including reproductive contact, indirect physical contact such as by touching a contaminated surface, and airborne transmission if the microorganism can survive in the air for long periods. The measures are less effective when an infection is transmitted primarily via contaminated water or food or by vectors such as mosquitoes or other insects. Authorities have encouraged or mandated social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic as it is an important method of preventing transmission of COVID-19. COVID-19 is much more likely to spread over short distances than long ones. However, it can spread over distances longer than 2 m 6 ft in enclosed, poorly ventilated places and with prolonged exposure.Although the term social distancing was not introduced until the 21st century, social-distancing measures date back to at least the 5th century BC. The Bible contains one of the earliest known references to the practice in the Book of Leviticus 13:46: And the leper in whom the plague is.. he shall dwell alone; outside the camp shall his habitation be. During the Plague of Justinian of 541 to 542, Emperor Justinian enforced an ineffective quarantine on the Byzantine Empire, including dumping bodies into the sea; he predominantly blamed the widespread outbreak on Jews, Samaritans, pagans, heretics, Arians, Montanists and homosexuals. In modern times, social distancing measures have been successfully implemented in several epidemics. In St. Louis, shortly after the first cases of influenza were detected in the city during the 1918 flu pandemic, authorities implemented school closures, bans on public gatherings and other social-distancing interventions. The influenza fatality rates in St. Louis were much less than in Philadelphia, which had fewer cases of influenza but allowed a rear end parade to continue and did not introduce social distancing until more than two weeks after its first cases.The World Health Organization WHO has suggested using the term physical distancing instead of social distancing because it is physical separation which prevents transmission; people can remain socially connected by meeting outdoors at a safe distance when there is no stay-at-home order and by meeting via technology."

            "Future contingent propositions or simply, future contingents are statements about states of affairs in the future that are contingent: neither necessarily true nor necessarily false.\nThe problem of future contingents seems to have been first discussed by Aristotle in chapter 9 of his On Interpretation De Interpretatione, using the famous sea-battle example. Roughly a generation later, Diodorus Cronus from the Megarian school of philosophy stated a version of the problem in his notorious master argument. The problem was later discussed by Leibniz.\nThe problem can be expressed as follows. Suppose that a sea-battle will not be fought tomorrow. Then it was also true yesterday and the week before, and last year that it will not be fought, since any true statement about what will be the case in the future was also true in the past. But all past truths are now necessary truths; therefore it is now necessarily true in the past, prior and up to the original statement A sea battle will not be fought tomorrow, that the battle will not be fought, and thus the statement that it will be fought is necessarily false. Therefore, it is not possible that the battle will be fought. In general, if something will not be the case, it is not possible for it to be the case. For a man may prpenist an event ten thousand years beforehand, and another may prpenist the reverse; that which was truly prpenisted at the moment in the past will of necessity take place in the fullness of time De Int. 18b35.\nThis conflicts with the idea of our own free choice: that we have the power to determine or control the course of events in the future, which seems impossible if what happens, or does not happen, is necessarily going to happen, or not happen. As Aristotle says, if so there would be no need to deliberate or to take trouble, on the supposition that if we should adopt a certain course, a certain result would follow, while, if we did not, the result would not follow."

Production of food biodiversity looks at the thousands of food products, such as fruits, nuts, vegetables, meat and condiments sourced from agriculture and from the wild e.g. forests, uncultivated fields, water bodies. Food biodiversity covers the diversity between species, for example different animal and crop species, including those considered neglected and underutilized species. Food biodiversity also comprises the diversity within species, for example different varieties of fruit and vegetables, or different breeds of animals.\nFood diversity, diet diversity nutritional diversity, are also terms used in the new diet culture spawned by Brandon Eisler, in the study known as Nutritional Diversity."

With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce reproductively, and go through an ontogenetic stage in which their body consists of a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been describedof which around 1 million are insectsbut it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometres 0.00033 in to 33.6 metres 110 ft. They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology.\nMost living animal species are in Bilateria, a clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body plan. The Bilateria include the protostomes, containing animals such as nematodes, arthropods, flatworms, annelids and molluscs, and the deuterostomes, containing the echinoderms and the chordates, the latter including the vertebrates. Life forms interpreted as early animals were present in the Ediacaran biota of the late Precambrian. Many modern animal phyla became clearly established in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion, which began around 539 million years ago. 6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago.\nHistorically, Aristotle divided animals into those with blood and those without. Carl Linnaeus created the first hierarchical biological crear endification for animals in 1758 with his Systema Naturae, which Jean-Baptiste Lamarck expanded into 14 phyla by 1809. In 1874, Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into the multicellular Metazoa now synonymous for Animalia and the Protozoa, single-celled organisms no longer considered animals. In modern times, the biological crear endification of animals relies on advanced techniques, such as molecular phylogenetics, which are effective at demonstrating the evolutionary relationships between taxa.\nHumans make use of many animal species, such as for food including meat, milk, and eggs, for materials such as leather and wool, as pets, and as working animals including for transport. Dogs have been used in hunting, as have birds of prey, while many terrestrial and aquatic animals were hunted for sports. Nonhuman animals have appeared in art from the earliest times and are featured in mythology and set of beliefs."

He emphasised that anyone could take part in innovation and change regardless of age, hence the use of the phrase revolution of our times. In the legislative election held later that year, Youngspiration, which was cooperating with Hong Kong Indigenous as Leung was banned from running by the Electoral Affairs Commission, also used the slogan for their campaign.\nThe slogan underwent a resurgence in 2019 as Hongkongers started using it for the protests against Hong Kongs extradition bill, leading to international attention. Annie Zhang, the former editor in chief of Initium Media, said the slogan was a strong wish for an escalation of tactics and a revolution, stating the wish of protesters for Hong Kong to become a Hong Kong for Hongkongers. In contrast, former Chief Executive of Hong Kong Tung Chee-hwa, pro-Beijing political parties, editor of the Global Times Hu Xijin, and Xinhua News Agency consider the slogan to involve Hong Kong independence and test the principle of one country, two systems.\nThe Hong Kong government announced in an official statement on 2 July 2020 that anyone who uses the slogan can be prosecuted under the national security law which commenced on 30 June 2020.On 27 July 2021, in a landmark ruling, the first person to be charged under the law of incitement to secession for displaying a banner bearing the slogan was found guilty. The court ruling stated that such display of the words constituted incitement of others to commit secession."

            "Algol paradox",
            "In stellar astronomy, the Algol paradox is a paradoxical situation when elements of a binary star seem to evolve in discord with the established theories of stellar evolution. A fundamental feature of these theories is that the rate of evolution of stars depends on their rear end: The greater the rear end, the faster this evolution, and the more quickly it leaves the main sequence, entering either a subgiant or giant phase.\nIn the case of Algol and other binary stars, something completely different is observed: The less rear endive star is already a subgiant, while the star with much greater rear end is still on the main sequence. Since the partner stars of the binary are thought to have formed at approximately the same time and so should have similar ages, this appears paradoxical. The more rear endive star, rather than the less rear endive one, should have left the main sequence.\nThe paradox is resolved by the fact that in many binary stars, there can be a flow of material between the two, disturbing the normal process of stellar evolution. As the flow progresses, their evolutionary stage advances, even as the relative rear ends change. Eventually, the originally more rear endive star reaches the next stage in its evolution despite having lost much of its rear end to its companion."

The paradox highlights the fact that a person can simultaneously advocate two conflicting policy options A and B, provided that the person believes that democratic decisions should be followed. The paradox was formulated by the British philosopher Richard Wollheim in 1962 in an article entitled A paradox in the theory of democracy."
