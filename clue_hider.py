    # These words (Eragon, The, Hobbit) are the clues that we want to hide in the summary because they give away the answer to the card. Usually the cards mention the words at least once, towards the beginning of the summary.
    # We want to hide the clues in the summary so that the user can quickly read the summary like catchphrase and try to get others to guess the card title without using any of the (nonstopwords) words in the title of the card.

    # how? we can use the re.sub() function to replace the card title phrase with an empty string in the summary phrase.
    # the re.sub() function takes 3 arguments: the regex pattern to match, the string to replace the match with, and the string to search for the match in.

    # if these words appear in the card summary, we want to hide them in the summary by replacing them with the phrase "clue_hider" (or something similar)
    # we can use the re.sub() function to replace the words in the card title with the phrase "clue_hider" in the summary phrase.
