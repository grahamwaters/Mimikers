            "Climate change and cities",
            "Climate change and cities are deeply connected. Cities are one of the greatest contributors and likely best opportunities for addressing climate change. Cities are also one of the most vulnerable parts of the human society to the effects of climate change, and likely one of the most important solutions for reducing the environmental impact of humans. More than half of the worlds population is in cities, consuming a large portion of food and goods produced outside of cities. The increase of urban population growth is one of the main factors in air-quality problems. In the year 2016, 31 mega-cities reported having at least 10 million in their population, 8 of which surrear endd 20 million people. The UN projects that 68% of the world population will live in urban areas by 2050. Hence, cities have a significant influence on construction and transportationtwo of the key contributors to global warming emissions. Moreover, because of processes that create climate conflict and climate refugees, city areas are expected to grow during the next several decades, stressing infrastructure and concentrating more impoverished peoples in cities.Because of the high density and effects like the urban heat island affect, weather changes due to climate change are likely to greatly effect cities, exacerbating existing problems, such as air pollution, water scarcity, and heat illness in the metropolitan areas. Studies have shown that if body temperature exceeds 39C for a period of time, serious heat stroke may occur. Some of the other extreme weather conditions caused by climate change include extreme floods, deathly snowstorms, ice storms, heat waves, droughts, and hurricanes, which are often deathly and harmful. Studies have shown that heat waves are three times more likely to occur and have become more intense since the 1960s. Moreover, because most cities have been built on rivers or coastal areas, cities are frequently vulnerable to the subsequent effects of sea level rise, which cause coastal flooding and erosion, and those effects are deeply connected with other urban environmental problems, like subsidence and aquifer depletion.\nA report by the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group described consumption based emissions as having significantly more impact than production-based emissions within cities. The report estimates that 85% of the emissions associated with goods within a city is generated outside of that city. Climate change adaptation and mitigation investments in cities will be important in reducing the impacts of some of the largest contributors of greenhouse gas emissions: for example, increased density allows for redistribution of land use for agriculture and reforestation, improving transportation efficiencies, and greening construction largely due to cements outsized role in climate change and improvements in sustainable construction practices and weatherization.In the most recent past, increasing urbanization has also been proposed as a phenomenon that has a reducing effect on the global rate of carbon emission primarily because with urbanization comes technical prowess which can help drive sustainability. Lists of high impact climate change solutions tend to include city-focused solutions; for example, Project Drawdown recommends several major urban investments, including improved bicycle infrastructure, building retrofitting, district heating, public transit, and walkable cities as important solutions.Because of this, the international community has formed coalitions of cities such as the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group and ICLEI and policy goals, such as Sustainable Development Goal 11 sustainable cities and communities, to activate and focus attention on these solutions."

Typical road users include pedestrians, cyclists, motorists, vehicle passengers, horse riders, and passengers of on-road public transport mainly buses and trams.\\nBest practices in modern road safety strategy: \\n\\nThe basic strategy of a Safe System approach is to ensure that in the event of a crash, the impact energies remain below the threshold likely to produce either death or serious injury. This threshold will vary from crash scenario to crash scenario, depending upon the level of protection offered to the road users involved. For example, the chances of survival for an unprotected pedestrian hit by a vehicle diminish rapidly at speeds greater than 30 km/h, whereas for a properly restrained motor vehicle occupant the critical impact speed is 50 km/h for side impact crashes and 70 km/h for head-on crashes.\\nAs sustainable solutions for classes of road safety have not been identified, particularly low-traffic rural and remote roads, a hierarchy of control should be applied, similar to classifications used to improve occupational safety and health. At the highest level is sustainable prevention of serious injury and death crashes, with sustainable requiring all key result areas to be considered. At the second level is real-time risk reduction, which involves providing users at severe risk with a specific warning to enable them to take mitigating action. The third level is about reducing the crash risk which involves applying the road-design standards and guidelines such as from AASHTO, improving driver behavior and enforcement.Traffic safety has been studied as a science for more than 75 years."

Traditionally, it is sniffed or inhaled lightly after a pinch of snuff is either placed onto the back surface of the hand, held pinched between thumb and index finger, or held by a specially made snuffing device.\\nSnuff originated in the Americas and was in common use in Europe by the 17th century. Traditional snuff production consists of a lengthy, multi-step process, in tobacco snuff mills. The selected tobacco leaves are first subject to special tobacco curing or fermentation processes, where they will later provide the individual characteristics and flavor for each type of snuff blend. Snuff is usually scented or flavored, with many blends of snuff requiring months to years of special storage to reach the required maturity. Typical traditional flavors are varieties of blended tobacco leaves considered original fine snuff without any addition of scents or essences. Varieties of spice, piquant, fruit, floral, and mentholated also called medicated soon followed, either pure or in blends. Each snuff manufacturer usually has a variety of unique recipes and blends, as well as special recipes for individual customers. Common flavors also include coffee, chocolate, bordeaux, honey, vanilla, cherry, orange, apricot, plum, camphor, cinnamon, rose and spearmint. Modern flavors include bourbon, cola and whisky. Traditional classic German snuff blends are the pungent and sharp Schmalzler and Brasil blends.\\nSnuff comes in a range of texture and moistness, from very fine to coarse, and from toast very dry to very moist. Often drier snuffs are ground more finely. There is also a range of tobacco-free snuffs, such as Pschls Weiss White, made from glucose powder or herbs. While strictly speaking, these are not snuffs because they contain no tobacco, they are an alternative for those who wish to avoid nicotine, or for cutting a strong snuff to an acceptable strength."

            "The Rite of Spring, The Rite of Spring French: Le Sacre du printemps is a ballet and orchestral concert work by the Russian composer Igor Stravinsky. It was written for the 1913 Paris season of Sergei Diaghilevs Ballets Russes company; the original choreography was by Vaslav Nijinsky with stage designs and costumes by Nicholas Roerich. When first performed at the Thtre des Champs-lyses on 29 May 1913, the avant-garde nature of the music and choreography caused a sensation. Many have called the first-night reaction a riot or near-riot, though this wording did not come about until reviews of later performances in 1924, over a decade later. Although designed as a work for the stage, with specific passages accompanying characters and action, the music achieved equal if not greater recognition as a concert piece and is widely considered to be one of the most influential musical works of the 20th century.\\nStravinsky was a young, virtually unknown composer when Diaghilev recruited him to create works for the Ballets Russes. Le Sacre du printemps was the third such major project, after the acclaimed Firebird 1910 and Petrushka 1911. The concept behind The Rite of Spring, developed by Roerich from Stravinskys outline idea, is suggested by its subtitle, Pictures of Pagan Russia in Two Parts; the scenario depicts various primitive rituals celebrating the advent of spring, after which a young girl is chosen as a sacrificial victim and dances herself to death. After a mixed critical reception for its original run and a short London tour, the ballet was not performed again until the 1920s, when a version choreographed by Lonide Massine replaced Nijinskys original, which saw only eight performances. Massines was the forerunner of many innovative productions directed by the worlds leading choreographers, gaining the work worldwide acceptance. In the 1980s, Nijinskys original choreography, long believed lost, was reconstructed by the Joffrey Ballet in Los Angeles.\\nStravinskys score contains many novel features for its time, including experiments in tonality, metre, rhythm, stress and dissonance. Analysts have noted in the score a significant grounding in Russian folk music, a relationship Stravinsky tended to deny. Regarded as among the first modernist works, the music influenced many of the 20th-centurys leading composers and is one of the most recorded works in the classical repertoire."

Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 August 1962 in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He has since been featured in films, television shows, novels, video games, and plays. Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker, an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues and gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black Cat; and foes such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin, and Venom. In his origin story, Spider-Man gets superhuman spider-powers and abilities from a bite from a radioactive spider; these include clinging to surfaces and ceilings, superhuman strength, speed, and agility, and detecting danger with his precognition ability called spider-sense. He also builds wrist-mounted web-shooter devices that shoot artificial spider-webs of his own design that were meant to be used for fighting his enemies and web-swinging across the city. After his personal tragedy of his late Uncle Ben, Peter began using his spider-powers to fight against crime as Spider-Man.\\nWhen Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist. The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker, a high school student from Queens, New York, as Spider-Mans secret identity, whose self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness were issues to which young readers could relate. While Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick, unlike previous teen heroes such as Bucky and Robin, Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman; he thus had to learn for himself that with great power comes great responsibility a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man story but later retroactively attributed to his guardian, his late Uncle Ben Parker.\\nMarvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series, the first and longest-lasting of which is The Amazing Spider-Man. Over the years, the Peter Parker character developed from a shy, nerdy New York City high school student to a troubled but outgoing college student, to a married high school teacher to, in the late 2000s, a single freelance photographer. In the 2000s, he joins the Avengers. Doctor Octopus also took on the identity for a story arc spanning 20122014, following a body swap plot in which Peter appears to die. Marvel has also published books featuring alternate versions of Spider-Man, including Spider-Man 2099, which features the adventures of Miguel OHara, the Spider-Man of the future; Ultimate Spider-Man, which features the adventures of a teenaged Peter Parker in an alternate universe; and Ultimate Comics Spider-Man, which depicts the teenager Miles Morales, who takes up the mantle of Spider-Man after Ultimate Peter Parkers supposed death. Miles later became a popular superhero in his own right and was brought into the mainstream continuity, where he sometimes works alongside Peter.\\nSpider-Man is one of the most popular and commercially successful superheroes. He has appeared in countless forms of media, including several animated TV series, a live-action television series, syndicated newspaper comic strips, and multiple series of films. The character was first portrayed in live-action by Danny Seagren in Spidey Super Stories, a The Electric Company skit which ran from 1974 to 1977. In films, Spider-Man has been portrayed by actors Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, and in the Marvel Cinematic Universe by Tom Holland. He was voiced by Chris Pine and Jake Johnson in the animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse 2018, with Johnson reprising the role in its sequel Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse 2023.

Studios in Burbank, California, with the exception of one sequence at Van Nuys Airport in Van Nuys, Los Angeles.\\nAlthough Casablanca was an A-list film with established stars and first-rate writers, no one involved with its production expected it to stand out among the hundreds of pictures produced by Hollywood yearly. Casablanca was rushed into release to take advantage of the publicity from the Allied invasion of North Africa a few weeks earlier. It had its world premiere on November 26, 1942, in New York City and was released nationally in the United States on January 23, 1943. The film was a solid if unspectacular success in its initial run.\\nExceeding expectations, Casablanca went on to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, while Curtiz was selected as Best Director and the Epsteins and Koch were honored for Best Adapted Screenplay. Its reputation has gradually grown, to the point that its lead characters, memorable lines, and pervasive theme song have all become iconic, and it consistently ranks near the top of lists of the greatest films in history. In 1989, the United States Library of Congress selected the film as one of the first for preservation in the National Film Registry for being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."

Her reign of 63 years and 216 days was longer than that of any previous British monarch and is known as the Victorian era. It was a period of industrial, political, scientific, and military change within the United Kingdom, and was marked by a great expansion of the British Empire. In 1876, the British Parliament voted to grant her the additional title of Empress of India.\\nVictoria was the daughter of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn the fourth son of King George III, and Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. After the deaths of her father and grandfather in 1820, she was raised under close supervision by her mother and her comptroller, John Conroy. She inherited the throne aged 18 after her fathers three elder brothers died without surviving legitimate issue. Victoria, a constitutional monarch, attempted privately to influence government policy and ministerial appointments; publicly, she became a national icon who was identified with strict standards of personal morality.\\nVictoria married her first cousin Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1840. Their children married into royal and noble families across the continent, earning Victoria the sobriquet the grandmother of Europe and spreading haemophilia in European royalty. After Alberts death in 1861, Victoria plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances. As a result of her seclusion, British republicanism temporarily gained strength, but in the latter half of her reign, her popularity recovered. Her Golden and Diamond jubilees were times of public celebration. Victoria died in 1901 at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, at the age of 81. The last British monarch of the House of Hanover, she was succeeded by her son Edward VII of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha."

            "Eugene Young (character)",
            "Eugene Young character, Eugene Young is a fictional character played by Steve Harris on the American legal drama, The Practice, created by David E. Kelley. Eugene was one of the original cast members and stayed as a main character until the end of the series, which ran between 1997 and 2004.At the opening of the series, Eugene played an attorney working for Bobby Donnell, and before long was made a partner along with Lindsay Dole and Ellenor Frut, precipitating the firm changing its name to Donnell, Young, Dole, and Frutt. In one of the first episodes, Eugene comments that he has been a lawyer for seven years Trial and Error. He had been the first to join with Bobby, several years prior to the start of the show he may or may not have done so immediately upon his becoming a lawyer. He was a private investigator before that, and his detective skills including some strong arm tactics come up from time to time in his legal career.\\nLike many of the attorneys on the series, Eugenes home life is tumultuouswhile identified as married in the fifth episode, the tenth episode states him as being separated and in all probability that was the case from the onset of the series. Still, in that episode, Dog Bite, he turns down a date from an attractive D.A., though his reason for doing so is because his son is not ready for that. Soon the divorce is finalized and his wife takes custody of their son, who is only about twelve years old at the time. Eugene struggles to be a good father and to keep his son on the straight and narrow. He admits more than once that part of what drives him is that his brother died in prison after being falsely convicted. His dream was always to change the system for the better, and one avenue of how to do that he long thought of was an appointment as a judge.\\nAt some point in his life, Eugene was pulled over and beaten by the police for matching the general description of a wanted suspect. Perhaps as a direct result of that, Eugene especially in the series early seasons had no problem playing the race card to get some of his African American clients off the hook. It also prompted him to get involved with the defense of a police officer who was fired for admitting that he had a racial problem First Degree. The police officer felt that his years on the force had turned him into a racist, and was seeking disability and an early pension. Even though the thought of giving an admitted racist disability benefits was uncomfortable, Eugene felt that there was an opportunity for greater goodit may prompt more police officers to admit when they are having problems with racism. In the course of that proceeding, Eugene did allow his pent up feelings regarding his beat down to seep through, angrily charging that racism is a cancer that must be eradicated where you find it and that it is an epidemic in the police department.\\nLike most of the other members of the firm and ironically Alan Shore, Eugene opposes the death penalty. In one of the final episodes of the series run, when a panel of judges questions his position, he passionately and honestly defends it. New Hoods on the Block\\nEugenes character for the first seven seasons is in many ways intended to be a foil for Bobby Donnell. One of the key elements of the show is the conflict that arises when legal ethics may violate moral ethics. While Bobby constantly struggles with this, Eugene typically remains more stoic, though at times even he admits to feeling empty.\\nA few examples of the above include:\\n\\nWhen Bobby was having an improper affair with one of their clients a woman accused of murder Eugene constantly asserted that Bobbys judgment was impaired. He even stated never fall in love with a client should be the first thing they teach you in law school. When Bobby finally realized he had lost his edge because of his feelings, Eugene had to make an impromptu closing argument in the trial. Reasonable Doubts\\nAfter a young girl gives birth to a still born baby at home unbeknown to anyone, the parents of the mother who is still in high school want to abandon the body for fear that their daughter might be implicated in the childs death. Eugene is distraught when Bobby breaks the law by advising the parents to deliver the baby to the steps of a church he knows of. Bobby admits it has nothing to do with the lawbut his religious beliefs compel him to see that the baby is not merely dumped without a funeral. A Day in the LifeHowever, as stated, sometimes Eugenes strict by-the-book approach gets the better of him.\\n\\nEugene is assigned to defend a young black man with a criminal record who is accused of armed robbery. Eugene is not interested in whether or not the young man is really guilty, as he has no intention of having him testify. While Eugene successfully gets him off, the young man is angered that Eugene did not believe he was telling the truth. Rather than feel elated at winning the case, Eugene ends up at a bar reflecting how cynical the practice of law can leave attorneys from time to time.When Bobby leaves the firm, Eugene becomes the senior partner, with Jimmy Berluti being elevated to full partner. Against his better judgment he allows Eleanor Frutt to hire Alan Shore, an unscrupulous lawyer who consistently butts heads with both Eugene and Jimmy. After continuous unethical and even illegal behavior by Shore, in addition to the conflicts with the firm, Eugene makes the decision with Jimmy but not Eleanor to fire Shore, giving him a small severance package. Shore sues the firm on the basis of wrongful termination, as he had over the previous eight months brought in substantially more money for the firm than all the other partners combined. Shore wins the case, which directly causes a breakdown at the firm.\\nAt that time, Jimmy decides to quit the firm, and Eugene has a meeting with a lawyer at a top firm, though he has no interest in joining. The meeting was, in fact, merely a pretense for the lawyer to conduct an interview with Eugene, as he has been recommended to be appointed as a Superior Court Judge. After a hearing before a review panel where Eugene is grilled over various topics including the death penalty where Eugene stands his ground and Bobby appears to speak on his behalf, Eugene is appointed to the bench. At first, his decision to accept upset Eleanor, as she feels he is abandoning the firm, just like all the others, but soon accepts his decision. Eugenes first case as a judge was about a wheelchair-using woman charging her employer with sex offences. However, he left the case when he saw Alan Shore representing the defendant. Eugene thought that Alan had judge-shopped when actually Alan was only assigned the case on the hearing day being a friend of Denny Crane, the defendant hesitated before going to Crane, Poole & Schmidt for help. To resolve their issues, Alan tells Eugene that his respect for him exceeds that of the respect he is required to give any other judge."

It involved the vast majority of the worlds countriesincluding all of the great powersforming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers. World War II was a total war that directly involved more than 100 million personnel from more than 30 countries.\\nThe major participants in the war threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role in the conflict, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and deploying the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war.\\nWorld War II was by far the deadliest conflict in human history; it resulted in 70 to 85 million fatalities, mostly among civilians. Tens of millions died due to genocides including the Holocaust, starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of the Axis defeat, Germany and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.\\nThe causes of World War II are debated, but contributing factors included the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, Spanish Civil War, Second Sino-Japanese War, SovietJapanese border conflicts, rise of fascism in Europe and rising European tensions since World War I. World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. The United Kingdom and France subsequently declared war on Germany on 3 September. Under the MolotovRibbentrop Pact of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union had partitioned Poland and marked out their spheres of influence across Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan with other countries later. Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa, and the fall of France in mid-1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire, with war in the Balkans, the aerial Battle of Britain, the Blitz of the United Kingdom, and the Battle of the Atlantic. On 22 June 1941, Germany led the European Axis powers in an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the Eastern Front, the largest land theatre of war in history.\\nJapan, which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific, was at war with the Republic of China by 1937. In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific, including an attack on the US fleet at Pearl Harbor which resulted in the United States declaring war against Japan. The European Axis powers declared war on the United States in solidarity. Japan soon captured much of the western Pacific, but its advances were halted in 1942 after losing the critical Battle of Midway; later, Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943including a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasions of Sicily and the Italian mainland, and Allied offensives in the Pacificcost the Axis powers their initiative and forced them into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France, while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and turned towards Germany and its allies. During 1944 and 1945, Japan suffered reversals in mainland Asia, while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and captured key western Pacific islands.\\nThe war in Europe concluded with the liberation of German-occupied territories and the invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the Fall of Berlin to Soviet troops, Hitlers suicide, and the German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. Following the refusal of Japan to surrender on the terms of the Potsdam Declaration issued 26 July 1945, the United States dropped the first atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima on 6 August and Nagasaki on 9 August. Faced with an imminent invasion of the Japanese archipelago, the possibility of additional atomic bombings, and the Soviet Unions declared entry into the war against Japan on the eve of invading Manchuria, Japan announced on 10 August its intention to surrender, signing a surrender document on 2 September 1945.\\nWorld War II changed the political alignment and social structure of the globe. The United Nations was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts, with the victorious great powersChina, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United Statesbecoming the permanent members of its Security Council. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the nearly half-century-long Cold War. In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonisation of Africa and Asia. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion. Political and economic integration, especially in Europe, began as an effort to forestall future hostilities, end pre-war enmities and forge a sense of common identity."

The members are characters from movies, books, cartoons, television, video games, and comics.To qualify for the list, members must be both fictional in the sense that we excluded mythological and folkloric figures and characters meaning they are part of a narrative story or series of stories, in addition to being wealthy. The one exception to the rule was Santa Claus, a character whom Forbes decided to be an irresistible addition, although he has been absent from the list since 2006. Forbes stated, We still estimate Clauss net worth as infinite, but we excluded him from this years rankings after being bombarded by letters from outraged children insisting that Claus is real. We dont claim to have settled the ongoing controversy concerning Clauss existence, but after taking into account the physical evidencetoys delivered, milk and cookies devouredwe felt it was safer to remove him from consideration. After Claus was excluded, Scrooge McDuck became the wealthiest member due to being portrayed as having a tower vault full of gold. Carol Miller or Mom from Futurama is the wealthiest woman on the list, with an estimated $15.7 billion.\\nThe wealth of fictional characters under consideration for the list is calculated by combining the fictional source texts with real-world information about stock and commodity prices.

He was among the most influential figures in jazz. His career spanned five decades and several eras in the history of jazz.Armstrong was born and raised in New Orleans. Coming to prominence in the 1920s as an inventive trumpet and cornet player, Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz, shifting the focus of the music from collective improvisation to solo performance. Around 1922, he followed his mentor, Joe King Oliver, to Chicago to play in the Creole Jazz Band. In Chicago, he spent time with other popular jazz musicians, reconnecting with his friend Bix Beiderbecke and spending time with Hoagy Carmichael and Lil Hardin. He earned a reputation at cutting contests, and his fame reached band leader Fletcher Henderson. Henderson persuaded Armstrong to come to New York City, where he became a featured and musically influential band soloist and recording artist. Hardin became Armstrongs second wife and they returned to Chicago to play together and then he began to form his own Hot jazz bands. After years of touring, he settled in Queens, New York, and by the 1950s, he was a national musical icon, assisted in part, by his appearances on radio and in film and television, in addition to his concerts.\\nWith his instantly recognizable rich, gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer and skillful improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song. He was also skilled at scat singing. Armstrong is renowned for his charismatic stage presence and voice as well as his trumpet playing. By the end of Armstrongs life, his influence had spread to popular music in general. Armstrong was one of the first popular African-American entertainers to cross over to wide popularity with white and international audiences. He rarely publicly politicized his race, to the dismay of fellow African Americans, but took a well-publicized stand for desegregation in the Little Rock crisis. He was able to access the upper echelons of American society at a time when this was difficult for black men.\\nArmstrong appeared in films such as High Society 1956 alongside Bing Crosby, Grace Kelly, and Frank Sinatra, and Hello, Dolly! 1969 starring Barbra Streisand. He received many accolades including three Grammy Award nominations and a win for his vocal performance of Hello, Dolly! in 1964. In 2017, he was posthumously inducted into the Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame."

            "The Wizard of Oz 1939 film, The Wizard of Oz is a 1939 American musical fantasy film produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer MGM. An adaptation of L. Frank Baums 1900 childrens fantasy novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the film was primarily directed by Victor Fleming who left the production to take over the troubled Gone with the Wind, and stars Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley, Billie Burke and Margaret Hamilton. Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson, and Edgar Allan Woolf received credit for the screenplay, but others made uncredited contributions. The music was composed by Harold Arlen and adapted by Herbert Stothart, with the lyrics written by Edgar Yip Harburg.\\nCharacterized by its use of Technicolor, fantasy storytelling, musical score, and memorable characters, The Wizard of Oz was moderately successful upon its original release of August 25, 1939. The film was considered a critical success and was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, winning in two categories: Best Original Song for Over the Rainbow and Best Original Score by Stothart. While the film was sufficiently popular at the box office, it failed to make a profit for MGM until the 1949 re-release, earning only $3,017,000 on a $2,777,000 budget, not including promotional costs, which made it MGMs most expensive production at that time.The 1956 television broadcast premiere of the film on the CBS network reintroduced the film to the public; according to the U.S. Library of Congress, it is the most seen film in movie history. In 1989, it was selected by the Library of Congress as one of the first 25 films for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant. It is also one of the few films on UNESCOs Memory of the World Register. The film was ranked second in Varietys inaugural 100 Greatest Movies of All Time list published in 2022. It was among the top ten in the 2005 BFI British Film Institute list of 50 films to be seen by the age of 14, and is on the BFIs updated list of 50 films to be seen by the age of 15 released in May 2020.The Wizard of Oz has become the source of many quotes referenced in contemporary popular culture. The film ranks often on critics lists of greatest films of all time, and is the most commercially successful adaptation of L. Frank Baums work."

Nicknamed Iron Mike and Kid Dynamite in his early career, and later known as The Baddest Man on the Planet, Tyson is considered to be one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time. He reigned as the undisputed world heavyweight champion from 1987 to 1990. Tyson won his first 19 professional fights by knockout, 12 of them in the first round. Claiming his first belt at 20 years, four months, and 22 days old, Tyson holds the record as the youngest boxer ever to win a heavyweight title. He was the first heavyweight boxer to simultaneously hold the WBA, WBC and IBF titles, as well as the only heavyweight to unify them in succession. The following year, Tyson became the lineal champion when he knocked out Michael Spinks in 91 seconds of the first round. In 1990, Tyson was knocked out by underdog Buster Douglas in one of the biggest upsets in history.\\nIn 1992, Tyson was convicted of rape and sentenced to six years in prison, although he was released on parole after three years. After his release in 1995, he engaged in a series of comeback fights, regaining the WBA and WBC titles in 1996 to join Floyd Patterson, Muhammad Ali, Tim Witherspoon, Evander Holyfield and George Foreman as the only men in boxing history to have regained a heavyweight championship after losing it. After being stripped of the WBC title in the same year, Tyson lost the WBA title to Evander Holyfield by an eleventh round stoppage. Their 1997 rematch ended when Tyson was disqualified for biting Holyfields ears, one bite notoriously being strong enough to remove a portion of his right ear. In 2002, Tyson fought for the world heavyweight title, losing by knockout to Lennox Lewis.\\nTyson was known for his ferocious and intimidating boxing style as well as his controversial behavior inside and outside the ring. With a knockout-to-win percentage of 88%, he was ranked 16th on The Ring magazines list of 100 greatest punchers of all time, and first on ESPNs list of The Hardest Hitters in Heavyweight History. Sky Sports described him as perhaps the most ferocious fighter to step into a professional ring. He has been inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame and the World Boxing Hall of Fame."

The game is set in 2062 after humans have colonized the Moon and established several space stations. Earth-based mechanic Tadashi and his girlfriend discover a mech from a war eight years past with an ominous message stored in its memory suggesting Earth is in danger. Tadashi decides to venture to nearby space colonies along with Elina and his younger sister Azusa to investigate the origins of the mech. As Tadashi, the player speaks with other characters and picks dialogue and action commands to advance the narrative.\\nDevelopment was led by artist Yoshimiru Hoshi, who was contracted to develop the game after Satoru Iwata, who produced the game, was impressed by his character graphics. Yoshimiru wrote the script and was responsible for the game artwork. Although the Famicom had limited graphical capabilities and relied on the use of tilesets for artwork, he used advanced graphical techniques so his pixel art mirrored his manga-style pencil work. The detail placed on the graphics extended the games development for four years.\\nThe long development time and advanced graphics made Metal Slader Glory the largest Famicom game and one of the costliest to develop. It required a special chip which made the carts expensive to produce. Nintendo only sold enough chips to HAL so they could produce one run. The game was met with mixed reviews, and although the first run sold out, it did not cover the games advertising budget. The game placed a large financial strain on HAL Laboratory. As the company drove towards bankruptcy, they ceased independently publishing console games and entered a close affiliation with Nintendo.\\nYoshimiru considers Metal Slader Glory his life work. He has continued to explore the universe through manga and other works. A remake for the Super Famicom was released in 2000 on Nintendo Power flash cartridges, and was the last game released for the system. Both the original and remake were later released on the Virtual Console in Japan. A fan translation was released in 2018."

The two Guardians balance out the forces in the universe, although the Black Guardian seems to desire to upset the balance in favour of chaos and evil while the White Guardian prefers to maintain the status quo. The Guardians both appeared in Season 16 of the programme, where all six serials of that season were linked together in the quest for the Key to Time, an artifact of immense power that would give the wielder supreme power over all existence.\\nThe White Guardian had concerns that the universe was descending into chaos. As a result, he asked the Doctor to find and assemble the Key to Time so that he might restore the balance of the universe. The Doctor was successful in this task, but the Black Guardian disguised himself as the White and tried to deceive the Doctor into handing the key over to him instead. The Doctor saw through the Black Guardians ruse - due to the Guardians lack of concern for Astra of Atrios, who was literally the sixth segment; the White Guardian would never have been so callous about the fate of a sentient being - and ordered the key to disperse, though he commented afterwards that the White Guardian should have been able to carry out his work while the key was assembled.\\nThe Guardian next appeared briefly during Enlightenment, the conclusion of the Black Guardian Trilogy, a story arc in which the evil Guardian attempted to force Turlough to kill the Doctor.

            "The Long Count Fight, The Long Count Fight, or the Battle of the Long Count, was a professional boxing 10-round rematch between world heavyweight champion Gene Tunney and former champion Jack Dempsey, which Tunney won in a unanimous decision. It took place on September 22, 1927, at Soldier Field in Chicago. Long Count is applied to the fight because when Tunney was knocked down in the seventh round the count was delayed due to Dempseys failure to go to and remain in a neutral corner. Whether this long count actually affected the outcome remains a subject of debate.\\nJust 364 days before, on September 23, 1926, Tunney had beaten Dempsey by a ten round unanimous decision to lift the world heavyweight title, at Sesquicentennial Stadium in Philadelphia. The first fight between Tunney and Dempsey had been moved out of Chicago because Dempsey had learned that Al Capone was a big fan of his, and he did not want Capone to be involved in the fight. Capone reportedly bet $50,000 on Dempsey for the rematch, which fueled false rumors of a fix. Dempsey was favored by odds makers in both fights, largely because of public betting which heavily tilted towards Dempsey.\\nThe rematch was held at Chicagos Soldier Field, and would draw a gate of $2,658,660 equivalent to $41,474,000 in 2021. It was the first $2 million gate in entertainment history.\\nDespite the fact that Tunney had won the first fight by a wide margin on the scorecards, the prospect of a second bout created tremendous public interest. Dempsey was one of the so-called big five sports legends of the 1920s, and it was widely rumored that he had refused to participate in the military during World War I. He actually had attempted to enlist in the Army, but had been turned down; a jury later exonerated Dempsey of draft evasion. Tunney, who enjoyed literature and the arts, was a former member of the United States Marine Corps. His nickname was The Fighting Marine.\\nThe fight took place under new rules regarding knockdowns: the fallen fighter would have 10 seconds to rise to his feet under his own power, after his opponent moved to a neutral corner i.e., one with no trainers. The new rule, which was not yet universal, was asked to be put into use during the fight by the Dempsey camp, who had requested it during negotiations. Dempsey, in the final days of training prior to the rematch, apparently ignored the setting of these new rules. Also, the fight was staged inside a 20-foot ring, which favored the boxer with superior footwork, in this case Tunney. Dempsey liked to crowd his opponents, and normally fought in a 16-foot ring that offered less space to maneuver."

Born Baron Wallis, he is a member of The Boys, a group of CIA-sponsored vigilantes led by William Billy Butcher who observe, record, and sometimes liquidate Supes i.e. superpowered or superhuman individuals, often acting as superheroes artificially created by the mega-conglomerate Vought. One of two Supes in the group alongside The Female of the Species, Wallis mother was dosed with the superpower-inducing Compound V while pregnant with him, the result of which was her eventually mutating into a Cthulhu-like creature, and him and later his daughter Janine becoming the first naturally-born Supe, prematurely aging appearing to be in his 40s when in fact in his 20s. To stay alive, Mothers Milk requires continued consumption of his mothers Compound V-enhancing mothers milk on a semi-regular basis, leading to him taking the term as a sobriquet and boxing ring name. He later rises to become heavyweight champion of the world following his military career, before being recruited to the Boys after accidentally killing his opponent in the ring, becoming Butchers second-in-command/best friend over years of missions and befriending Hugh Wee Hughie Campbell on his own recruitment. After helping Butcher finally get his revenge on Black Noir, M.M. learns that Butcher plans on killing all Supes and potential Supes i.e. every person ever exposed to Compound V, including him and his daughter. After confronting Butcher over this and for having already killed Frenchie, the Female, and M.Ms abusive ex-wife, M.M. is smothered to death by Butcher to prevent him from interfering with his plan. In order to avenge her son, M.M.s mother then gives Hughie the necessary milk to kill Butcher.\\nThe character is primarily portrayed by Laz Alonso in the Amazon Prime Video streaming adaptation while Elias Leon Leacock portrays a young Marvin in the third season. Unlike the comic series, Marvin T. Mothers Milk, primarily known as MM, is depicted as a regular human though still a military veteran with a dislike of Vought and its Supes resulting from a car crash caused by Soldier Boy in MMs youth, which killed his mother, uncle, and grandfather, and led to his father working himself to death as a lawyer unsuccessfully attempting to sue Vought. In the present storyline, MM joins Butcher and the reformed Boys in exposing the existence of Compound V and taking down Stormfront in the first and second seasons, while in the third season, set two years later, a now-divorced MM rejoins the Boys as they attempt to take down Victoria Neuman and the Homelander, coming to odds with Butcher over his use of V-24 and partnership with a still-alive Soldier Boy Homelanders father. Mothers Milks lactophiliac tendencies from the comic series are additionally instead adapted to Homelander portrayed by Antony Starr in the television series, while his status as the first naturally-born Supe is adapted to Ryan Butcher portrayed by Cameron Crovetti. The character has received a positive critical reception."

Originally intended to be a fighting game, the project was instead retooled into an adventure trilogy spanning three discs due to its scope, which were going to be released as separate entries that would have connected each of their plots into one overarching narrative, with Highlander: The Last of the MacLeods being the first title launched from the planned trilogy.\\nHighlander: The Last of the MacLeods received mixed reception from critics and reviewers since its initial release on the Jaguar CD, who praised various aspects such as the presentation and graphics but others felt divided in regards to the sound design and controls, while some also drew comparison with Alone in the Dark and Resident Evil due to its similar play style. A PC port was in development by Lore Design and announced to be published under the Atari Interactive brand but it was never officially released, thus ultimately remaining as an exclusive for the add-on instead, while neither sequel in the planned trilogy were ever released to the public."

            "Wild Bill Hickok, James Butler Hickok May 27, 1837 August 2, 1876, better known as Wild Bill Hickok, was a folk hero of the American Old West known for his life on the frontier as a soldier, scout, lawman, gambler, showman, and actor, and for his involvement in many famous gunfights. He earned a great deal of notoriety in his own time, much of it bolstered by the many outlandish and often fabricated tales he told about himself. Some contemporaneous reports of his exploits are known to be fictitious, but they remain the basis of much of his fame and reputation.\\nHickok was born and raised on a farm in northern Illinois at a time when lawlessness and vigilante activity were rampant because of the influence of the Banditti of the Prairie. Drawn to this ruffian lifestyle, he headed west at age 18 as a fugitive from justice, working as a stagecoach driver and later as a lawman in the frontier territories of Kansas and Nebraska. He fought and spied for the Union Army during the American Civil War and gained publicity after the war as a scout, marksman, actor, and professional gambler. He was involved in several notable shootouts during the course of his life.\\nIn 1876, Hickok was shot and killed while playing poker in a saloon in Deadwood, Dakota Territory present-day South Dakota by Jack McCall, an unsuccessful gambler. The hand of cards which he supposedly held at the time of his death has become known as the dead mans hand: two pairs; black aces and eights.\\nHickok remains a popular figure of frontier history. Many historic sites and monuments commemorate his life, and he has been depicted numerous times in literature, film, and television. He is chiefly portrayed as a protagonist, although historical accounts of his actions are often controversial, and much of his career is known to have been exaggerated both by himself and by contemporary mythmakers. While Hickok claimed to have killed numerous named and unnamed gunmen in his lifetime, his career as a gunfighter only lasted from 1861 to 1871. According to Joseph G. Rosa, Hickoks biographer and the foremost authority on Wild Bill, Hickok killed only six or seven men in gunfights."

Some organs and tissues can be donated by living donors, such as a kidney or part of the liver, part of the pancreas, part of the lungs or part of the intestines, but most donations occur after the donor has died.In 2019, Spain had the highest donor rate in the world at 46.91 per million people, followed by the US 36.88 per million, Croatia 34.63 per million, Portugal 33.8 per million, and France 33.25 per million.As of February 2, 2019, there were 120,000 people waiting for life-saving organ transplants in the US. Of these, 74,897 people were active candidates waiting for a donor. While views of organ donation are positive, there is a large gap between the numbers of registered donors compared to those awaiting organ donations on a global level.To increase the number of organ donors, especially among underrepresented populations, current approaches include the use of optimized social network interventions, exposing tailored educational content about organ donation to target social media users. Every year August 13 is observed as World Organ Donation Day to raising awareness about the importance of organ donation."

From 1940 to 1944, during World War II, he served as head of the collaborationist regime of Vichy France. Ptain, who was 84 years old in 1940, remains the oldest person to become the head of state of France.\\nDuring World War I, Ptain led the French Army to victory at the nine-month-long Battle of Verdun. After the failed Nivelle Offensive and subsequent mutinies he was appointed Commander-in-Chief and succeeded in repairing the armys confidence. Ptain remained in command for the rest of the war and emerged as a national hero. During the interwar period he was head of the peacetime French Army, commanded joint Franco-Spanish operations during the Rif War and served twice as a government minister. During this time he was known as le vieux Marchal The Old Marshal.\\nWith the imminent Fall of France and the Cabinet wanting to ask for an armistice, on 17 June 1940 Prime Minister Paul Reynaud resigned, recommending to President Albert Lebrun that he appoint Ptain in his place, which he did that day, while the government was at Bordeaux. The Cabinet then resolved to sign armistice agreements with Germany and Italy. The entire government subsequently moved briefly to Clermont-Ferrand, then to the spa town of Vichy in central France. The government voted to transform the French Third Republic into the French State or Vichy France, an authoritarian regime that collaborated with the Axis. After Germany and Italy occupied and disarmed France in November 1942, Ptains government worked very closely with the Nazi German military administration.\\nAfter the war, Ptain was tried and convicted for treason. He was originally sentenced to death, but due to his age and World War I service his sentence was commuted to life in prison. His journey from military obscurity, to hero of France during World War I, to collaborationist ruler during World War II, led his successor Charles de Gaulle to write that Ptains life was successively banal, then glorious, then deplorable, but never mediocre."

            "God is dead, God is dead German: Gott ist tot ; also known as the death of God is a widely quoted statement made by the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Nietzsche used the phrase to express his idea that the Enlightenment had eliminated the possibility of the existence of God. Proponents of the strongest form of the Death of God theology have used the phrase in a literal sense, meaning that the Christian God, who had existed at one point, has ceased to exist.\\nNietzsches complete statement is:\\n\\nGod is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?\\nThe phrase appeared in Nietzsches 1882 collection The Gay Science Die frhliche Wissenschaft, also translated as The Joyful Pursuit of Knowledge and Understanding. It is more famously associated with his Thus Spoke Zarathustra Also sprach Zarathustra, which is most responsible for making the phrase popular. Other philosophers had previously discussed the concept, \\nincluding Philipp Mainlnder and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel."

It has secondary characteristics similar to film noir, distinguished by a female character who dominates the relationship with the male central character, whose masculinity is challenged. The two engage in a humorous battle of the sexes, which was a new theme for Hollywood and audiences at the time.The genre also featured romantic attachments between members of different social classes, as in It Happened One Night 1934 and My Man Godfrey 1936.What sets the screwball comedy apart from the generic romantic comedy is that screwball comedy puts the emphasis on a funny spoofing of love, while the more traditional romantic comedy ultimately accents love. Other elements of the screwball comedy include fast-paced, overlapping repartee, farcical situations, escapist themes, physical battle of the sexes, disguise and masquerade, and plot lines involving courtship and marriage. Some comic plays are also described as screwball comedies."

He was Prime Minister of Italy from the March on Rome in 1922 until his deposition in 1943, and Duce of Italian Fascism from the establishment of the Italian Fasces of Combat in 1919 until his execution in 1945 by Italian partisans. As dictator of Italy and principal founder of fascism, Mussolini inspired and supported the international spread of fascist movements during the inter-war period.Mussolini was originally a socialist politician and a journalist at the Avanti! newspaper. In 1912, he became a member of the National Directorate of the Italian Socialist Party PSI, but he was expelled from the PSI for advocating military intervention in World War I, in opposition to the partys stance on neutrality. In 1914, Mussolini founded a new journal, Il Popolo dItalia, and served in the Royal Italian Army during the war until he was wounded and discharged in 1917. Mussolini denounced the PSI, his views now centering on Italian nationalism instead of socialism, and later founded the fascist movement which came to oppose egalitarianism and class conflict, instead advocating revolutionary nationalism transcending class lines. On 31 October 1922, following the March on Rome 2830 October, Mussolini was appointed prime minister by King Victor Emmanuel III, becoming the youngest individual to hold the office up to that time. After removing all political opposition through his secret police and outlawing labor strikes, Mussolini and his followers consolidated power through a series of laws that transformed the nation into a one-party dictatorship. Within five years, Mussolini had established dictatorial authority by both legal and illegal means and aspired to create a totalitarian state. In 1929, Mussolini signed the Lateran Treaty with the Holy See to establish Vatican City.\\nMussolinis foreign policy aimed to restore the ancient grandeur of the Roman Empire by expanding Italian colonial possessions and the fascist sphere of influence. In the 1920s, he ordered the Pacification of Libya, instructed the bombing of Corfu over an incident with Greece, established a protectorate over Albania, and incorporated the city of Fiume into the Italian state via agreements with Yugoslavia. In 1936, Ethiopia was conquered following the Second ItaloEthiopian War and merged into Italian East Africa AOI with Eritrea and Somalia. In 1939, Italian forces annexed Albania. Between 1936 and 1939, Mussolini ordered the successful Italian military intervention in Spain in favor of Francisco Franco during the Spanish civil war. Mussolinis Italy initially tried to avoid the outbreak of a second global war, sending troops at the Brenner Pass to delay Anschluss and taking part in the Stresa front, the Lytton Report, the Treaty of Lausanne, the Four-Power Pact and the Munich Agreement. However, Italy then alienated itself from Britain and France by aligning with Germany and Japan. Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, resulting in declarations of war by France and the UK and the start of World War II.\\nOn 10 June 1940, Mussolini decided to enter the war on the Axis side. Despite initial success, the subsequent Axis collapse on multiple fronts and eventual Allied invasion of Sicily made Mussolini lose the support of the population and members of the Fascist Party. As a consequence, early on 25 July 1943, the Grand Council of Fascism passed a motion of no confidence in Mussolini; later that day King Victor Emmanuel III dismissed him as head of government and had him placed in custody, appointing Pietro Badoglio to succeed him as Prime Minister. After the king agreed to an armistice with the Allies, on 12 September 1943 Mussolini was rescued from captivity in the Gran Sasso raid by German paratroopers and Waffen-SS commandos led by Major Otto-Harald Mors. Adolf Hitler, after meeting with the rescued former dictator, then put Mussolini in charge of a puppet regime in northern Italy, the Italian Social Republic Italian: Repubblica Sociale Italiana, RSI, informally known as the Sal Republic, causing a civil war. In late April 1945, in the wake of near total defeat, Mussolini and his mistress Clara Petacci attempted to flee to Switzerland, but both were captured by Italian communist partisans and summarily executed by firing squad on 28 April 1945 near Lake Como. The bodies of Mussolini and his mistress were then taken to Milan, where they were hung upside down at a service station to publicly confirm their demise."

He is best known for his silent film work, in which his trademark was physical comedy accompanied by a stoic, deadpan expression that earned him the nickname The Great Stone Face. Critic Roger Ebert wrote of Keatons extraordinary period from 1920 to 1929 when he worked without interruption as having made him the greatest actor-director in the history of the movies. In 1996, Entertainment Weekly recognized Keaton as the seventh-greatest film director, and in 1999 the American Film Institute ranked him as the 21st-greatest male star of classic Hollywood cinema.Working with independent producer Joseph M. Schenck and filmmaker Edward F. Cline, Keaton made a series of successful two-reel comedies in the early 1920s, including One Week 1920, The Playhouse 1921, Cops 1922, and The Electric House 1922. He then moved to feature-length films; several of them, such as Sherlock Jr. 1924, The General 1926, Steamboat Bill, Jr. 1928, and The Cameraman 1928, remain highly regarded. The General is widely viewed as his masterpiece: Orson Welles considered it the greatest comedy ever made.and perhaps the greatest film ever made. Keatons art has inspired full academic study.His career declined when he signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and lost his artistic independence. His wife divorced him, and he descended into alcoholism. He recovered in the 1940s, remarried, and revived his career as an honored comic performer for the rest of his life, earning an Academy Honorary Award in 1959."

If computer A costs twice as much as computer B, you should expect computer A to be four times as fast as computer B.\\nTwo years before Groschs statement, Seymour Cray was quoted in Business Week August 1963 expressing this very same thought:\\n\\nComputers should obey a square law when the price doubles, you should get at least four times as much speed.\\nThe law can also be interpreted as meaning that computers present economies of scale: the more costly is the computer, the priceperformance ratio linearly becomes better. This implies that low-cost computers cannot compete in the market.\\nAn analysis of rental cost/performance data for computers between 1951 and 1963 by Knight found that Groschs law held for commercial and scientific operations a modern analysis of the same data found that Groschs law only applied to commercial operations. In a separate study Knight Archived 2017-02-24 at the Wayback Machine found that Groschs law did not apply to computers between 1963-1967 also confirmed by a modern analysis."

            "Robert Falcon Scott, Captain Robert Falcon Scott, , 6 June 1868 c. 29 March 1912 was a British Royal Navy officer and explorer who led two expeditions to the Antarctic regions: the Discovery expedition of 19011904 and the ill-fated Terra Nova expedition of 19101913. On the first expedition, he set a new southern record by marching to latitude 82S and discovered the Antarctic Plateau, on which the South Pole is located. On the second venture, Scott led a party of five which reached the South Pole on 17 January 1912, less than five weeks after Amundsens South Pole expedition.\\nA planned meeting with supporting dog teams from the base camp failed, despite Scotts written instructions, and at a distance of 162 miles 261 km from their base camp at Hut Point and approximately 12.5 miles 20 km from the next depot, Scott and his companions died. When Scott and his partys bodies were discovered, they had in their possession the first Antarctic fossils ever discovered. The fossils were determined to be from the Glossopteris tree and proved that Antarctica was once forested and joined to other continents.Before his appointment to lead the Discovery expedition, Scott had a career as a naval officer in the Royal Navy. In 1899, he had a chance encounter with Sir Clements Markham, the president of the Royal Geographical Society, and thus learned of a planned Antarctic expedition, which he soon volunteered to lead. Having taken this step, his name became inseparably associated with the Antarctic, the field of work to which he remained committed during the final 12 years of his life.\\nFollowing the news of his death, Scott became a celebrated hero, a status reflected by memorials erected across the UK. However, in the last decades of the 20th century, questions were raised about his competence and character. Commentators in the 21st century have regarded Scott more positively after assessing the temperature drop below 40 C 40 F in March 1912, and after re-discovering Scotts written orders of October 1911, in which he had instructed the dog teams to meet and assist him on the return trip."

He was the de facto leader of Libya from 1969 to 2011, first as Revolutionary Chairman of the Libyan Arab Republic from 1969 to 1977 and then as the Brotherly Leader of the Great Socialist Peoples Libyan Arab Jamahiriya from 1977 to 2011. Initially ideologically committed to Arab nationalism and Arab socialism, he later ruled according to his own Third International Theory.\\nBorn near Sirte, Italian Libya, to a poor Bedouin Arab family, Gaddafi became an Arab nationalist while at school in Sabha, later enrolling in the Royal Military Academy, Benghazi. Within the military, he founded a revolutionary group which deposed the Western-backed Senussi monarchy of Idris in a 1969 coup. Having taken power, Gaddafi converted Libya into a republic governed by his Revolutionary Command Council. Ruling by decree, he deported Libyas Italian population and ejected its Western military bases. Strengthening ties to Arab nationalist governmentsparticularly Gamal Abdel Nassers Egypthe unsuccessfully advocated pan-Arab political union. An Islamic modernist, he introduced sharia as the basis for the legal system and promoted Islamic socialism. He nationalized the oil industry and used the increasing state revenues to bolster the military, fund foreign revolutionaries, and implement social programs emphasizing house-building, healthcare and education projects. In 1973, he initiated a Popular Revolution with the formation of Basic Peoples Congresses, presented as a system of direct democracy, but retained personal control over major decisions. He outlined his Third International Theory that year in The Green Book.\\nGaddafi transformed Libya into a new socialist state called a Jamahiriya state of the masses in 1977. He officially adopted a symbolic role in governance but remained head of both the military and the Revolutionary Committees responsible for policing and suppressing dissent. During the 1970s and 1980s, Libyas unsuccessful border conflicts with Egypt and Chad, support for foreign militants, and alleged responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing in Scotland left it increasingly isolated on the world stage. A particularly hostile relationship developed with Israel, the United States and the United Kingdom, resulting in the 1986 U.S. bombing of Libya and United Nationsimposed economic sanctions. From 1999, Gaddafi shunned pan-Arabism, and encouraged pan-Africanism and rapprochement with Western nations; he was Chairperson of the African Union from 2009 to 2010. Amid the 2011 Arab Spring, protests against widespread corruption and unemployment broke out in eastern Libya. The situation descended into civil war, in which NATO intervened militarily on the side of the anti-Gaddafist National Transitional Council NTC. Gaddafis government was overthrown; he retreated to Sirte, only to be captured and killed by NTC militants.\\nA highly divisive figure, Gaddafi dominated Libyas politics for four decades and was the subject of a pervasive cult of personality. He was decorated with various awards and praised for his anti-imperialist stance, support for Araband then Africanunity, as well as for significant development to the country following the discovery of oil reserves. Conversely, many Libyans strongly opposed Gaddafis social and economic reforms; he was posthumously accused of sexual abuse. He was condemned by many as a dictator whose authoritarian administration systematically violated human rights and financed global terrorism in the region and abroad."

Santana was developed by Glee creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan. Introduced as a minor antagonist and a sidekick to Quinn Fabray Dianna Agron in the first episode of Glee, Santanas role grew over the course of the shows first season. In the second season, Rivera was promoted to a series regular, and Santana was given more high-profile storylines, such as the development of her romantic feelings for her best friend Brittany Pierce Heather Morris, and the subsequent realization that she is a lesbian. Rivera, who was vocally supportive of the love story between her and Morris character, received widespread praise for her portrayal of Santana, as well as for her for vocal work in numerous songs performed as part of the shows central glee club, New Directions.\\nSantana is introduced alongside Quinn and Brittany as one of the three most popular cheerleaders at the fictional William McKinley High School in Lima, Ohio, where the show is set. She joins the schools glee club, and soon is spying on it for Sue Sylvester Jane Lynch, coach of the cheerleading team the Cheerios. As the season progresses, she becomes more sympathetic to other glee club members, saying she is staying in the club not because Sue is forcing her, but because she likes it. She has several romantic relationships, briefly dating Puck Mark Salling, taking Finn Hudsons Cory Monteith virginity, and carrying on a friends with benefits relationship with Brittany. In season two, the show delves into the motivations behind Santanas antagonism and her sexual aggressiveness towards boys; it is later revealed that her cruel attitude is partly driven by her struggle with her romantic feelings towards Brittany, and subsequently with her lesbian identity. This storyline has been positively received by critics."

            "McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II, The McDonnell Douglas now Boeing AV-8B Harrier II is a single-engine ground-attack aircraft that constitutes the second generation of the Harrier family, capable of vertical or short takeoff and landing V/STOL. The aircraft is primarily employed on light attack or multi-role missions, ranging from close air support of ground troops to armed reconnaissance. The AV-8B is used by the United States Marine Corps USMC, the Spanish Navy, and the Italian Navy. A variant of the AV-8B, the British Aerospace Harrier II, was developed for the British military, while another, the TAV-8B, is a dedicated two-seat trainer.\\nThe project that eventually led to the AV-8Bs creation started in the early 1970s as a cooperative effort between the United States and United Kingdom, aimed at addressing the operational inadequacies of the first-generation Hawker Siddeley Harrier. Early efforts centered on a larger, more powerful Pegasus engine to dramatically improve the capabilities of the Harrier. Because of budgetary constraints, the UK abandoned the project in 1975. Following the UKs withdrawal, McDonnell Douglas extensively redesigned the earlier AV-8A Harrier to create the AV-8B. While retaining the general layout of its predecessor, the aircraft incorporates a new, larger composite wing with an additional hardpoint on each side, an elevated cockpit, a redesigned fuselage and other structural and aerodynamic refinements. The aircraft is powered by an upgraded version of the Pegasus. The AV-8B made its maiden flight in November 1981 and entered service with the USMC in January 1985. Later upgrades added a night-attack capability and radar, resulting in the AV-8BNA and AV-8B Harrier II Plus versions, respectively. An enlarged version named Harrier III was also studied but not pursued. The UK, through British Aerospace, re-joined the improved Harrier project as a partner in 1981, giving it a significant work-share in the project. Following corporate mergers in the 1990s, Boeing and BAE Systems have jointly supported the program. Approximately 340 aircraft were produced in a 22-year production program that ended in 2003.\\nTypically operated from small aircraft carriers, large amphibious assault ships and simple forward operating bases, AV-8Bs have participated in numerous military and humanitarian operations, proving themselves versatile assets. U.S. Army General Norman Schwarzkopf named the USMC Harrier II as one of several important weapons in the Gulf War. It has also served in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan since 2001, the Iraq War since 2003, and was used in Operation Odyssey Dawn in Libya in 2011. Italian and Spanish Harrier IIs have taken part in overseas conflicts in conjunction with NATO coalitions. During its service history, the AV-8B has had a high accident rate, related to the percentage of time spent in critical take-off and landing phases. USMC and Italian Navy AV-8Bs are being replaced by the Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II, with the former expected to operate its Harriers until 2025."

His 18-year term as General Secretary was second only to Joseph Stalins in duration. Brezhnevs tenure as General Secretary remains debated by historians; while his rule was characterised by political stability and significant foreign policy successes, it was also marked by corruption, inefficiency, economic stagnation, and rapidly growing technological gaps with the West. \\nBrezhnev was born to a working-class family in Kamenskoye now Kamianske, Ukraine within the Yekaterinoslav Governorate of the Russian Empire. After the results of the October Revolution were finalized with the creation of the Soviet Union, Brezhnev joined the Communist partys youth league in 1923 before becoming an official party member in 1929. When Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, he joined the Red Army as a commissar and rose rapidly through the ranks to become a major general during World War II. Following the wars end, Brezhnev was promoted to the partys Central Committee in 1952 and rose to become a full member of the Politburo by 1957. In 1964, he garnered enough power to replace Nikita Khrushchev as First Secretary of the CPSU, the most powerful position in the country. \\nDuring his tenure, Brezhnevs conservative, pragmatic approach to governance significantly improved the Soviet Unions international standing while stabilizing the position of its ruling party at home. Whereas Khrushchev often enacted policies without consulting the rest of the Politburo, Brezhnev was careful to minimize dissent among the party leadership by reaching decisions through consensus. Additionally, while pushing for dtente between the two Cold War superpowers, he achieved nuclear parity with the United States and strengthened the Soviet Unions dominion over Central and Eastern Europe. Furthermore, the massive arms buildup and widespread military interventionism under Brezhnevs leadership substantially expanded the Soviet Unions influence abroad particularly in the Middle East and Africa, although these endeavors would prove to be costly and would drag on the Soviet economy in the later years.\\nConversely, Brezhnevs disregard for political reform ushered in an era of societal decline known as the Brezhnev Stagnation. In addition to pervasive corruption and falling economic growth, this period was characterized by an increasing technological gap between the Soviet Union and the United States. Upon coming to power in 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev denounced Brezhnevs government for its inefficiency and inflexibility before implementing policies to liberalise the Soviet Union.\\nAfter 1975, Brezhnevs health rapidly deteriorated and he increasingly withdrew from international affairs, while keeping his hold on power. He died on 10 November 1982 and was succeeded as general secretary by Yuri Andropov."

As Lennon walked into the archway of his apartment building at The Dakota, Chapman shot Lennon from a few yards away with a Charter Arms Undercover .38 Special revolver. Lennon was hit four times from the back. Chapman remained at the scene reading J. D. Salingers novel The Catcher in the Rye until he was arrested by police. He planned to cite the novel as his manifesto.\\nRaised in Decatur, Georgia, Chapman had been a fan of the Beatles, but was incensed by Lennons lifestyle and public statements, such as his remark about the band being more popular than Jesus and the lyrics of his later songs God and Imagine. In the years leading up to the murder, Chapman developed a series of obsessions, including artwork and the music of Todd Rundgren. The Catcher in the Rye took on great personal significance for him, to the extent that he wished to model his life after the novels protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Chapman also contemplated killing other public figures, including Johnny Carson, Paul McCartney, Ronald Reagan and Elizabeth Taylor. He had no prior criminal convictions and had just resigned from a job as a security guard in Hawaii.\\nFollowing the murder, Chapmans legal team intended to mount an insanity defense based on the testimony of mental health experts who said that he was in a delusional psychotic state. He was more cooperative with the prosecutor, who argued that his symptoms fell short of a schizophrenia diagnosis. As the trial approached, he instructed his lawyers that he wanted to plead guilty based on what he had decided was the will of God. The judge granted Chapmans request and deemed him competent to stand trial. He was sentenced to a prison term of 20 years to life with a stipulation that mental health treatment would be provided.\\nChapman refused requests for press interviews during his first six years in prison; he later said that he regretted the murder and did not want to give the impression that he killed Lennon for fame and notoriety. He ultimately supplied audiotaped interviews to journalist Jack Jones, who used them to write the investigative book Let Me Take You Down: Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman in 1992. In 2000, Chapman became eligible for parole, which has since been denied 12 times. His life was dramatized in the films The Killing of John Lennon 2006 and Chapter 27 2007."

            "Stuart Gharty",
            "Stuart Gharty, Stuart Gharty is a fictional character played by Peter Gerety in the television series Homicide: Life on the Street.He is introduced in the season four one-shot episode Scene of the Crime, as a cowardly patrolman who allows two drug dealers to murder each other rather than venture into a housing project to prevent the crime. This exercise in poor judgment, compounded by his failure to call for back-up, and his attempt to later cover up these failings, leads to a hearing in which he is exonerated. At the end of the episode, Detective Megan Russert, the chief witness against Gharty, seems to be successful in her attempt to talk him into resigning and admitting to himself that he is not cut out for police work.\\nHe is a Catholic. His father and grandfather were both butchers. When he was a teenager, he considered becoming a priest but changed his mind after meeting his wife. He had a brother named Joey.At the time of his introduction, Gharty is 54 years old, with a wife, Flora; a daughter, Ellen; and two granddaughters, Sarah and Sandra. He tells Russert that he is six months away from being able to transfer into a desk job and get off patrol duty, and that concern for his familys welfare was the main reason that he did not go in after the shooters.\\nHe later returns in the two-part season 5 finale, Partners and Other Strangers and Strangers and Other Partners, in which it is revealed that not only did he not resign, he was promoted to Detective and given a senior position in the Internal Investigations Division one of many unjust promotions featured in the show. He plays a key role in solving the murder of Detective Beau Felton, who, Gharty reveals, had been working for IID regarding possible corruption in the Auto Squad. Russert and Sergeant Kay Howard blame him for Feltons death for sending him undercover. When Lt. Giardello temporarily assigns him and Auto Squad Det. Falsone to the Homicide squad, Frank Pembleton originally does not want to work with him. Gharty later tells Pembleton that he suffered a brutal beating during an IID investigation and got over his fear of being hurt on the job. Afterwards, he works well with the homicide detectives and helps clear Feltons murder.\\nIn season 6, Gharty is transferred to homicide as a result of a departmental rotation program recently implemented in the Baltimore Police Department. As a homicide detective partnered with Laura Ballard to whom he is extremely loyal, Gharty sometimes displays racist paranoia, homophobia and other forms of pettiness, but for the most part redeems himself as a police officer, demonstrating aptitude, confidence, and devotion he had not exhibited as a patrolman. In the season 6 finale, he and Ballard are both wounded during a gunfight in the squad room; the shooter also kills three uniformed officers before being shot dead by several other detectives.\\nJohn Munch, despite describing Gharty as a buddy on at least one occasion, is openly disdainful of his presence in the unit, and begins in season 7 to openly question Ghartys statement that he served in Vietnam. Gharty and Munch also clash when both fall for bartender Billie Lou, as Gharty had begun an affair with her that led to his divorce but she ended up with and briefly married Munch. After Munch illegally obtains Ghartys service records and finds he received an other than honorable discharge, Gharty tells the whole story: he witnessed American troops committing atrocities against the residents of a village, and a superior officer ordered Gharty onto a waiting helicopter, only to then allow the unit to continue massacring the villagers. Gharty had briefly threatened his superior with a weapon during this confrontation, resulting in disciplinary action for insubordination and eventually his discharge.\\nGharty gets a divorce from his wife early in Season 7, and begins drinking heavily later in that season before he is able to pull himself together."

            "Love, Love encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental states, from the most sublime virtue or good habit, the deepest interpersonal affection, to the simplest pleasure. An example of this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse, which differs from the love for food. Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of a strong attraction and emotional attachment.Love is considered to be both positive and negative, with its virtue representing human kindness, compassion, and affection, as the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another and its vice representing human moral flaw, akin to vanity, selfishness, amour-propre, and egotism, as potentially leading people into a type of mania, obsessiveness or codependency. It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, ones self, or animals. In its various forms, love acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal relationships and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the creative arts. Love has been postulated to be a function that keeps human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species.Ancient Greek philosophers identified six forms of love: essentially, familial love in Greek, Storge, friendly love or platonic love Philia, romantic love Eros, self-love Philautia, guest love Xenia, and divine love Agape. Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of love: unrequited love, empty love, companionate love, consummate love, infatuated love, self-love, and courtly love. Numerous cultures have also distinguished Ren, Yuanfen, Mamihlapinatapai, Cafun, Kama, Bhakti, Mett, Ishq, Chesed, Amore, Charity, Saudade and other variants or symbioses of these states, as culturally unique words, definitions, or expressions of love in regards to a specified moments currently lacking in the English language.Scientific research on emotion has increased significantly over the past two decades. The color wheel theory of love defines three primary, three secondary and nine tertiary love styles, describing them in terms of the traditional color wheel. The triangular theory of love suggests intimacy, passion and commitment are core components of love. Love has additional religious or spiritual meaning. This diversity of uses and meanings combined with the complexity of the feelings involved makes love unusually difficult to consistently define, compared to other emotional states."

Filmed in the then recently introduced CinemaScope format and directed by Nicholas Ray, it offered both social commentary and an alternative to previous films depicting delinquents in urban slum environments. The film stars James Dean, Sal Mineo, and Natalie Wood.\\nThe film was a groundbreaking attempt to portray the moral decay of American youth, critique parental style, and explore the differences and conflicts between generations. The title was adopted from psychiatrist Robert M. Lindners 1944 book, Rebel Without a Cause: The Hypnoanalysis of a Criminal Psychopath. The film, however, does not make any references to Lindners book in any way. Warner Bros. released the film on October 27, 1955, nearly a month after Deans death in a car accident on September 30, 1955.\\nOver the years the film has achieved landmark status for the performance of Dean, fresh from his Oscar nominated role in East of Eden, in his most celebrated role. This was the only film during Deans lifetime in which he received top billing. In 1990, Rebel Without a Cause was added to the Library of Congresss National Film Registry as being deemed culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant."

It is based on class collaboration. It refers to the ties in a society that bind people together as one. The term is generally employed in sociology and the other social sciences as well as in philosophy and bioethics. It is also a significant concept in Catholic social teaching; therefore it is a core concept in Christian democratic political ideology.\\nWhat forms the basis of solidarity and how it is implemented vary between societies. In global south societies it may be mainly based on kinship and shared values while global north societies accumulate various theories as to what contributes to a sense of solidarity, or rather, social cohesion. Unlike collectivism, solidarism does not reject individuals and sees individuals as the basis of society.Solidarity is also one of six principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and December 20 of each year is International Human Solidarity Day recognized as an international observance. Concepts of solidarity are mentioned in the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, but not defined clearly. As biotechnology and biomedical enhancement research and production increase, the need for distinct definition of solidarity within healthcare system frameworks is important. However, solidarity is not mentioned in the European Convention on Human Rights nor in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and has hence lesser legal meaning when compared to basic rights."

Set in a decaying and morally bankrupt New York City following the Vietnam War, the film follows Travis Bickle De Niro, a veteran working as a taxi driver, and his deteriorating mental state as he works nights in the city. \\nWith The Wrong Man 1956 and A Bigger Splash 1973 as inspiration, Scorsese wanted the film to feel like a dream to audiences. With cinematographer Michael Chapman, filming began in the summer of 1975 in New York City, with actors taking pay cuts to ensure that the project could be completed on a low budget of $1.9 million. Production concluded that same year. Bernard Herrmann composed the films music in what would be his final score, finished just several hours before his death; the film is dedicated to him.\\nThe film was theatrically released by Columbia Pictures on February 7, 1976, where it was a critical and commercial success, despite generating controversy for its graphic violence at the climactic ending, and casting of then 12-year-old Foster in the role of a child prostitute. The film received numerous accolades including the 1976 Cannes Film Festivals Palme dOr, and four nominations at the 49th Academy Awards, including for Best Picture, Best Actor for De Niro, and Best Supporting Actress for Foster.\\nAlthough Taxi Driver generated further controversy for its role in John Hinckley Jr.s motive to attempt to assassinate then-President Ronald Reagan, the film has remained popular and is considered one of the most culturally significant and inspirational of its time. In 2012, Sight & Sound named it the 31st-best film ever in its decennial critics poll, ranked with The Godfather Part II, and the fifth-greatest film of all time on its directors poll. In 1994, the film was considered culturally, historically or aesthetically significant by the US Library of Congress, and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry."

            "George W. Bush, George Walker Bush born July 6, 1946 is an American politician who served as the 43rd president of the United States from 2001 to 2009. A member of the Republican Party, Bush family, and son of the 41st president George H. W. Bush, he previously served as the 46th governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000.\\nWhile in his twenties, Bush flew warplanes in the Texas Air National Guard. After graduating from Harvard Business School in 1975, he worked in the oil industry. In 1978, Bush unsuccessfully ran for the House of Representatives. He later co-owned the Texas Rangers of Major League Baseball before he was elected governor of Texas in 1994. As governor, Bush successfully sponsored legislation for tort reform, increased education funding, set higher standards for schools, and reformed the criminal justice system. He also helped make Texas the leading producer of wind powered electricity in the nation. In the 2000 presidential election, Bush defeated Democratic incumbent Vice President Al Gore after a narrow and contested win that involved a Supreme Court decision to stop a recount in Florida.\\nUpon taking office, Bush signed a major tax cut program and education reform bill, the No Child Left Behind Act. He pushed for socially conservative efforts such as the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act and faith-based initiatives. A decisive event that reshaped his administration was the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, resulting in the start of the war on terror and the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. Bush ordered the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, to overthrow the Taliban, destroy al-Qaeda, and capture Osama bin Laden. He signed the Patriot Act to authorize surveillance of suspected terrorists. He also ordered the 2003 invasion of Iraq, on the belief that Saddam Husseins regime possessed weapons of mass destruction; this led to Husseins eventual overthrow and capture by U.S. forces. Bush also signed the Medicare Modernization Act, which created Medicare Part D.\\nBush was re-elected president in 2004, defeating Democrat John Kerry and winning the popular vote. During his second term, Bush reached multiple free trade agreements. He appointed John Roberts and Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court. He sought major changes to Social Security and immigration laws, but both efforts failed in Congress. Bush was widely criticized for his handling of Hurricane Katrina and the midterm dismissal of U.S. attorneys. In the midst of his unpopularity, the Democrats regained control of Congress in the 2006 elections. The Afghanistan and Iraq wars continued, and in January 2007, Bush launched a surge of troops in Iraq. By December, the U.S. entered the Great Recession, prompting the Bush administration to obtain congressional approval for multiple economic programs intended to preserve the countrys financial system, including the Troubled Asset Relief Program. After finishing his second term, Bush returned to Texas, where his presidential library opened in 2013. He has maintained a low-profile since leaving office.\\nAt various points in his presidency, Bush was among both the most popular and unpopular presidents in U.S. history. He received the highest recorded approval ratings in the wake of the September 11 attacks, but also one of the lowest such ratings during the 20072008 financial crisis. Although public favorability of Bush has improved since he left office, his presidency has generally been rated as below-average by scholars."

It is the fourth game in the Need for Speed series and a follow-up to Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit. The game features more realistic elements than its predecessors and introduced a damage system that allows cars to take damage when colliding with objects, affecting their appearance and performance. It also introduced a series of economy-based tournaments, awarding players with a cash prize that can be spent on repairing, purchasing, or upgrading cars for subsequent races. The games Hot Pursuit mode, which was introduced in Hot Pursuit, was expanded with more options, allowing players to control police pursuits attempting to stop racers.\\nHigh Stakes was designed to convey a sense of risk and consequence, an idea that is primarily reflected in the games High Stakes mode, where a player can lose a saved car in a race, along with the money they had spent on upgrading it. Because the game features licensed cars, Electronic Arts had to convince manufacturers to let their cars take in-game damage. High Stakes also marked the return of the Porsche licence, which had been absent from racing games since Porsche Challenge in 1997. The game received positive reviews from critics, who occasionally compared it to Gran Turismo. Critics generally praised its graphics, artificial intelligence, and realistic elements, but criticized its inconsistent frame rate. The Microsoft Windows version was awarded Racing Game of the Year by Computer Gaming World."

Influenced by Impressionism and the Renaissance masters from a young age he became increasingly attracted to Cubism and avant-garde movements. He moved closer to Surrealism in the late 1920s and joined the Surrealist group in 1929, soon becoming one of its leading exponents. His best-known work, The Persistence of Memory, was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most famous Surrealist paintings. Dal lived in France throughout the Spanish Civil War 1936 to 1939 before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Spain in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his nuclear mysticism style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism, and recent scientific developments.Dals artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behavior often drew more attention than his artwork. His public support for the Francoist regime, his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial. His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, pop art and contemporary artists such as Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst.There are two major museums devoted to Salvador Dals work: the Dal Theatre-Museum in Figueres, Spain, and the Salvador Dal Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida."

            "Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth, Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth is a 2009 adventure video game developed and published by Capcom. It was originally released for the Nintendo DS in Japan in 2009, and internationally in 2010, and later for iOS and Android in 2017. It is the fifth game in the Ace Attorney series, and is set between the events of the third and fourth games, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trials and Tribulations and Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney.\\nWhile previous games in the series focus on defense attorneys, Ace Attorney Investigations has the player control prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, who investigates five cases that tie together to form an overarching story about a smuggling ring. The game consists of investigation phases, in which the player investigates crime scenes in search for evidence, and rebuttal phases, in which they confront other characters, to hear what they think has happened; the player is able to use evidence to find contradictions in the characters statements, to get closer to the truth.\\nThe game was directed by Takeshi Yamazaki and produced by Motohide Eshiro. Eshiro had come up with the idea of a new adventure game about Ace Attorney characters while working on Trials and Tribulations, and Yamazaki had the idea to have it be about deductive reasoning and crime scene investigation. The game was specifically designed to be different from previous Ace Attorney titles, with a larger focus on the environment. The development team had originally considered using Ema Skye, a character from earlier games in the series, as the lead character, but used Miles Edgeworth instead because of his popularity. They aimed to have players be immersed in the game and feel like they are Edgeworth, as opposed to previous Ace Attorney games, where they felt players merely could identify with the lead characters; to do this, they included direct control of Edgeworth, and a gameplay element that involves connecting his thoughts.\\nIt was met by generally favorable reviews, with a common complaint being that rebuttals at times devolve into trial and error. The game was one of the best selling games of 2009 in Japan, while Western sales were described as poor at best. After the games release, a manga series based on it has been released. A sequel, Ace Attorney Investigations 2, was released in Japan in 2011."

            "Role of Christianity in civilization",
            "Role of Christianity in civilization, Christianity has been intricately intertwined with the history and formation of Western society. Throughout its long history, the Church has been a major source of social services like schooling and medical care; an inspiration for art, culture and philosophy; and an influential player in politics and religion. In various ways it has sought to affect Western attitudes towards vice and virtue in diverse fields. Festivals like Easter and Christmas are marked as public holidays; the Gregorian Calendar has been adopted internationally as the civil calendar; and the calendar itself is measured from the date of Jesuss birth.\\nThe cultural influence of the Church has been vast. Church scholars preserved literacy in Western Europe following the Fall of the Western Roman Empire. During the Middle Ages, the Church rose to replace the Roman Empire as the unifying force in Europe. The medieval cathedrals remain among the most iconic architectural feats produced by Western civilization. Many of Europes universities were also founded by the church at that time. Many historians state that universities and cathedral schools were a continuation of the interest in learning promoted by monasteries. The university is generally regarded as an institution that has its origin in the Medieval Christian setting, born from Cathedral schools. The Reformation brought an end to religious unity in the West, but the Renaissance masterpieces produced by Catholic artists like Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael remain among the most celebrated works of art ever produced. Similarly, Christian sacred music by composers like Pachelbel, Vivaldi, Bach, Handel, Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Liszt, and Verdi is among the most admired classical music in the Western canon.\\nThe Bible and Christian theology have also strongly influenced Western philosophers and political activists. The teachings of Jesus, such as the Parable of the Good Samaritan, are among the most important sources of modern notions of human rights and the welfare commonly provided by governments in the West. Long-held Christian teachings on sexuality, marriage, and family life have also been influential and controversial in recent times. Christianity played a role in ending practices such as human sacrifice, infanticide and polygamy.:309 Christianity in general affected the status of women by condemning marital infidelity, divorce, incest, polygamy, birth control, infanticide female infants were more likely to be killed, and abortion.:104 While official Catholic Church teaching:61 considers women and men to be complementary equal and different, some modern advocates of ordination of women and other feminists argue that teachings attributed to St. Paul and those of the Fathers of the Church and Scholastic theologians advanced the notion of a divinely ordained female inferiority. Nevertheless, women have played prominent roles in Western history through and as part of the church, particularly in education and healthcare, but also as influential theologians and mystics.\\nChristians have made a myriad of contributions to human progress in a broad and diverse range of fields, both historically and in modern times, including the science and technology, medicine, fine arts and architecture, politics, literatures, music, philanthropy, philosophy,:15 ethics, humanism, theatre and business. According to 100 Years of Nobel Prizes a review of Nobel prizes award between 1901 and 2000 reveals that 65.4% of Nobel Prizes Laureates, have identified Christianity in its various forms as their religious preference. Eastern Christians particularly Nestorian Christians have also contributed to the Arab Islamic Civilization during the Ummayad and the Abbasid periods by translating works of Greek philosophers to Syriac and afterwards to Arabic. They also excelled in philosophy, science, theology and medicine.Christianity contributed greatly to the development of European cultural identity, although some progress originated elsewhere Romanticism began with the curiosity and passion of the pagan world of old. Outside the Western world, Christianity has had an influence and contributed on various cultures, such as in Africa, Central Asia, the Near East, Middle East, East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. Scholars and intellectuals agree Christians have made significant contributions to Arab and Islamic civilization since the introduction of Islam.Common criticisms of Christianity include oppression of women, condemnation of homosexuality, colonialism, and various other cases of violence. Christian ideas have been used both to support and end slavery as an institution. Criticism of Christianity has come from the different religious and non-religious groups around the world, some of whom were themselves Christians."

It is based on the manga series Yu Yu Hakusho by Yoshihiro Togashi. The plot follows the protagonist Yusuke Urameshi, who is tasked by the ruler of the afterlife with solving detective-style cases involving both humans and demons threatening the living world. The story begins to focus heavily on martial arts battles as it progresses.\\nThe game features 11 playable characters from the manga and traditional 2D fighting gameplay. Opponents compete in rounds, attempting to deplete each others health by utilizing short and long-range attacks and special combos. It also integrates other mechanics, such as allowing up to four players to compete simultaneously and letting fighters alternate between horizontal planes in the foreground and background. A number of multiplayer options are available that include battle royales, tag team matches, and tournament modes.\\nMaky Titsusen was produced at the height of a global fighting game boom for home consoles in the early 1990s, brought on by hits like Street Fighter II. After the company made its debut on the system with Gunstar Heroes, Treasure began development on Maky Titsusen as one of a quartet of Mega Drive games to be published by Sega. Unlike the rest of these titles, Maky Titsusen was never localized in North America or Europe. The games only other official release was in Brazil via Tectoy in 1999 where it was titled Yu Yu Hakusho: Sunset Fighters. The game did not receive any form of re-release until its inclusion on the Japanese Sega Mega Drive Mini in 2019. Despite its limited availability, the game has been assessed by several publications outside those two regions and enjoyed a mostly positive response from critics. The gameplay and four-player options were praised by many reviewers, several of which have even considered it among the best fighting games of the 16-bit generation, although its graphics and sound received criticism."

Major newspapers of the time soon claimed that Johnson was attacked by the government only after he became famous as a black man married to a white woman, and was linked to other white women. Johnson was arrested on charges of violating the Mann Actforbidding one to transport a woman across state lines for immoral purposesa racially motivated charge that embroiled him in controversy for his relationships, including marriages, with white women. Sentenced to a year in prison, Johnson fled the country and fought boxing matches abroad for seven years until 1920 when he served his sentence at the federal penitentiary at Leavenworth.\\nJohnson continued taking paying fights for many years, and operated several other businesses, including lucrative endorsement deals.

Members of the RAF generally used the MarxistLeninist term faction when they wrote in English. Early leadership included Andreas Baader, Ulrike Meinhof, Gudrun Ensslin, and Horst Mahler. The West German government considered the RAF to be a terrorist organization.The RAF engaged in a series of bombings, assassinations, kidnappings, bank robberies, and shoot-outs with police over the course of three decades. Their activity peaked in late 1977, which led to a national crisis that became known as the German Autumn.

Although better-known, the RAF conducted fewer attacks than the Revolutionary Cells, which is held responsible for 296 bomb attacks, arson and other attacks between 1973 and 1995. The group was motivated by leftist political concerns and the perceived failure of their parents generation to confront Germanys Nazi past, and received support from Stasi and other Eastern Bloc security services.\\nSometimes the group is talked about in terms of generations:\\n\\nthe first generation, which consisted of Baader, Ensslin, Meinhof and others;\\nthe second generation, after the majority of the first generation was arrested in 1972; and\\nthe third generation, which existed in the 1980s and 1990s up to 1998, after the first generation died in Stammheim maximum security prison in 1977.On 20 April 1998, an eight-page typewritten letter in German was faxed to the Reuters news agency, signed RAF with the submachine-gun red star, declaring that the group had dissolved.

When an assault on a Force Metal mining island occurs, a Maverick Hunter team led by X is sent out in response. Command Mission differs from previous entries in the series in that it is a turn-based role-playing game RPG rather than an action-platform game. Force Metal can be equipped to each playable character to gain special abilities.\\nThe game was developed by many of the team members who previously worked on Capcoms Breath of Fire series of RPGs. According to the producer of Command Mission, a plot-focused RPG based on the Mega Man X games was created because the series is well known for its action and storyline. Command Mission was met with a mostly average critical response. Reviewers generally praised its battle system, but disagreed about its other aspects."

            "Ferdinand Foch, Ferdinand Foch FOSH, French: fdin f; 2 October 1851 20 March 1929 was a French general and military theorist who served as the Supreme Allied Commander during the First World War. An aggressive, even reckless commander at the First Marne, Flanders and Artois campaigns of 19141916, Foch became the Allied Commander-in-Chief in late March 1918 in the face of the all-out German spring offensive, which pushed the Allies back using fresh soldiers and new tactics that trenches could not withstand. He successfully coordinated the French, British and American efforts into a coherent whole, deftly handling his strategic reserves. He stopped the German offensive and launched a war-winning counterattack. In November 1918, Marshal Foch accepted the German cessation of hostilities and was present at the Armistice of 11 November 1918.\\nAt the outbreak of war in August 1914, Fochs XX Corps participated in the brief invasion of Germany before retreating in the face of a German counter-attack and successfully blocking the Germans short of Nancy. Ordered west to defend Paris, Fochs prestige soared as a result of the victory at the Marne, for which he was widely credited as a chief protagonist while commanding the French Ninth Army. He was then promoted again to assistant commander-in-chief for the Northern Zone, a role which evolved into command of Army Group North, and in which role he was required to cooperate with the British forces at Ypres and the Somme. At the end of 1916, partly owing to the disappointing results of the latter offensive and partly owing to wartime political rivalries, Foch was transferred to Italy. Foch was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Armies on 26 March 1918 following being the commander-in-chief of Western Front with the title Gnralissime in 1918. He played a decisive role in halting a renewed German advance on Paris in the Second Battle of the Marne, after which he was promoted to Marshal of France. Addington says, to a large extent the final Allied strategy which won the war on land in Western Europe in 1918 was Fochs alone.On 11 November 1918, Foch accepted the German request for an armistice. Foch advocated peace terms that would make Germany unable to pose a threat to France ever again. He considered the Treaty of Versailles too lenient on Germany. Winston Churchill attributed a famous quote about the treaty to Foch: This is not peace. It is an armistice for twenty years."

A leading member of the revolutionary Arab Socialist Baath Party, and later, the Baghdad-based Baath Party and its regional organization, the Iraqi Baath Partywhich espoused Baathism, a mix of Arab nationalism and Arab socialismSaddam played a key role in the 1968 coup later referred to as the 17 July Revolution that brought the party to power in Iraq.\\nAs vice president under the ailing General Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, and at a time when many groups were considered capable of overthrowing the government, Saddam created security forces through which he tightly controlled conflicts between the government and the armed forces. In the early 1970s, Saddam nationalised the Iraq Petroleum Company and independent banks, eventually leaving the banking system insolvent due to inflation and bad loans. Through the 1970s, Saddam consolidated his authority over the apparatus of government as oil money helped Iraqs economy grow rapidly. Positions of power in the country were mostly filled with Sunni Arabs, a minority that made up only a fifth of the population.Saddam formally took power in 1979, although he had already been the de facto head of Iraq for several years. He suppressed several movements, particularly Shia and Kurdish movements which sought to overthrow the government or gain independence, respectively, and maintained power during the IranIraq War and the Gulf War. He ran a repressive authoritarian government, which several analysts have described as totalitarian, although the applicability of that label has been contested. Saddams rule was marked by numerous human rights abuses, including an estimated 250,000 arbitrary killings and bloody invasions of neighboring Iran and Kuwait.In 2003, a coalition led by the United States invaded Iraq to depose Saddam. US President George W. Bush and United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair erroneously accused Iraq of possessing weapons of mass destruction and having ties to al-Qaeda. Saddams Baath party was disbanded. After his capture on 13 December 2003, the trial of Saddam Hussein took place under the Iraqi Interim Government. On 5 November 2006, Saddam was convicted by an Iraqi court of crimes against humanity related to the 1982 killing of 148 Iraqi Shia and sentenced to death by hanging. He was executed on 30 December 2006."

Obama received national attention in 2004 with his March Senate primary win, his well-received July Democratic National Convention keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton, he was nominated by the Democratic Party for president and chose Joe Biden as his running mate. Obama was elected over Republican nominee John McCain in the presidential election and was inaugurated on January 20, 2009.

For ocean dynamics, the bottom irregularities are on the ocean floor such as the mid-ocean ridge. For atmospheric dynamics, the other primary branch of geophysical fluid dynamics, the bottom irregularities are found on land, for example in the form of mountains. Topographic Rossby waves are one of two types of geophysical waves named after the meteorologist Carl-Gustaf Rossby. The other type of Rossby waves are called planetary Rossby waves and have a different physical origin. Planetary Rossby waves form due to the changing Coriolis parameter over the earth. Rossby waves are quasi-geostrophic, dispersive waves. This means that not only the Coriolis force and the pressure-gradient force influence the flow, as in geostrophic flow, but also inertia."

Titles in this series are categorized as laptop-friendly since they do not require a dedicated graphic card.\\nIn addition to a freeplay Classic mode with open-ended gameplay, the games contain a structured, linear Story mode where players are required to complete a series of goals to progress in the storyline, similar to console entries in The Sims series. While Life Stories and Pet Stories each contain two separate stories, Castaway Stories contains one story that is double the length of any one story in the first two games.\\nAs an introductory series, major features are removed or modified from those in The Sims 2, possibly to simplify gameplay.

            "I Have a Dream, I Have a Dream is a public speech that was delivered by American civil rights activist and Baptist minister, Martin Luther King Jr., during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963. In the speech, King called for civil and economic rights and an end to racism in the United States. Delivered to over 250,000 civil rights supporters from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., the speech was a defining moment of the civil rights movement and among the most iconic speeches in American history.Beginning with a reference to the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared millions of slaves free in 1863, King said one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. Toward the end of the speech, King departed from his prepared text for a partly improvised peroration on the theme I have a dream, prompted by Mahalia Jacksons cry: Tell them about the dream, Martin! In this part of the speech, which most excited the listeners and has now become its most famous, King described his dreams of freedom and equality arising from a land of slavery and hatred.Jon Meacham writes that, With a single phrase, King joined Jefferson and Lincoln in the ranks of men whove shaped modern America. The speech was ranked the top American speech of the 20th century in a 1999 poll of scholars of public address. The speech has also been described as having a strong claim to be the greatest in the English language of all time."

De Josselin shot her first scenes in a cemetery on the Central Coast. She made her first appearance during the episode broadcast on 27 April 2015. The actress departed the show at the end of her guest stint, but she was later asked back by the producers and she became part of the regular cast.\\nBillie is portrayed as a feisty, upfront, tomboy surfer. Billes introductory storylines focused on her reunion with her brother Ash and a brief casual relationship with Kyle Braxton Nic Westaway. Later storylines saw Billie develop an infatuation with Nate Cooper Kyle Pryor after he saved her life. She became jealous of his relationship with Kat Chapman Pia Miller and tried to ruin her career. As the storyline progressed, Billie accused Nate of assaulting her, leading to his arrest. The storyline was criticised by Rosa Walling-Wefelmeyer of The F-Word, who thought it could potentially reinforce harmful stereotypes about victims of sexual violence.\\nBillie was then accused of burning down Leah Patterson-Bakers Ada Nicodemou house, despite helping to save three of its occupants and sustaining serious burns. Following a brief departure, Billie returned to Summer Bay for her court appearance. Billies early storylines have led her to be called unhinged, troublesome and the Bays bad girl by critics. Billie was later raped by Mick Jennings Kristian Schmid and became pregnant with his child. She also had a relationship with a then seventeen year old VJ Patterson Matt Little. Shortly after giving birth to her daughter, Luc, Billie was diagnosed with terminal cancer and she died on 15 February 2017."

He served as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1985 and additionally as head of state beginning in 1988, as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet from 1988 to 1989, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet from 1989 to 1990 and the only President of the Soviet Union from 1990 to 1991. Ideologically, Gorbachev initially adhered to MarxismLeninism but moved towards social democracy by the early 1990s.\\nGorbachev was born in Privolnoye, Russian SFSR, to a poor peasant family of Russian and Ukrainian heritage. Growing up under the rule of Joseph Stalin, in his youth he operated combine harvesters on a collective farm before joining the Communist Party, which then governed the Soviet Union as a one-party state. Studying at Moscow State University, he married fellow student Raisa Titarenko in 1953 and received his law degree in 1955. Moving to Stavropol, he worked for the Komsomol youth organization and, after Stalins death, became a keen proponent of the de-Stalinization reforms of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. He was appointed the First Party Secretary of the Stavropol Regional Committee in 1970, overseeing construction of the Great Stavropol Canal. In 1978, he returned to Moscow to become a Secretary of the partys Central Committee, and in 1979 joined its governing Politburo. Three years after the death of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnevfollowing the brief tenures of Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenkoin 1985 the Politburo elected Gorbachev as general secretary, the de facto leader.\\nAlthough committed to preserving the Soviet state and its Marxist-Leninist ideals, Gorbachev believed significant reform to be necessary for survival. He withdrew troops from the SovietAfghan War and embarked on summits with United States president Ronald Reagan to limit nuclear weapons and end the Cold War. Domestically, his policy of glasnost openness allowed for enhanced freedom of speech and press, while his perestroika restructuring sought to decentralize economic decision-making to improve its efficiency. His democratization measures and formation of the elected Congress of Peoples Deputies undermined the one-party state. Gorbachev declined to intervene militarily when various Eastern Bloc countries abandoned MarxistLeninist governance in 19891992. Internally, growing nationalist sentiment threatened to break up the Soviet Union, leading MarxistLeninist hardliners to launch the unsuccessful August Coup against Gorbachev in 1991. In the coups wake, the Soviet Union dissolved against Gorbachevs wishes. After resigning the presidency, he launched the Gorbachev Foundation, became a vocal critic of Russian presidents Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin, and campaigned for Russias social-democratic movement.\\nGorbachev is considered to be one of the most significant figures of the second half of the 20th century. The recipient of a wide range of awards, including the Nobel Peace Prize, he is praised for his role in ending the Cold War, introducing new political and economic freedoms in the Soviet Union, and tolerating both the fall of MarxistLeninist administrations in eastern and central Europe and the reunification of Germany. In Russia he is often derided for facilitating the dissolution of the Soviet Unionan event which weakened Russias global influence and precipitated an economic collapse in Russia and associated states."

It appeared in newspapers several times in the early 1920s, including several other examples in advertisements. It was originally a sarcastic remark made by creationists. The notion that people were descended from apes was considered blasphemous.by Darwins contemporaries, and it was for this reason that the sarcastic phrase came into use.Michael Quinion notes that the phrase Monkeys uncle occurs in a parody of Henry Wadsworth Longfellows 1855 poem The Song of Hiawatha which was reprinted in James Partons 1881 The Humorous Poetry of the English Language, and observes: This may be just an accident of invention, but the date fits.

It is bicameral, composed of a lower body, the House of Representatives, and an upper body, the Senate. It meets in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. Senators and representatives are chosen through direct election, though vacancies in the Senate may be filled by a governors appointment. Congress has 535 voting members: 100 senators and 435 representatives. The U.S. vice president has a vote in the Senate only when senators are evenly divided. The House of Representatives has six non-voting members.The sitting of a Congress is for a two-year term, at present, beginning every other January. Elections are held every even-numbered year on Election Day. The members of the House of Representatives are elected for the two-year term of a Congress. The Reapportionment Act of 1929 establishes that there be 435 representatives and the Uniform Congressional Redistricting Act requires that they be elected from single-member constituencies or districts. It is also required that the Congressional districts be apportioned among states by population every ten years using the U.S. census results, provided that each state has at least one Congressional representative. Each senator is elected at-large in their state for a six-year term, with terms staggered, so every two years approximately one-third of the Senate is up for election. Each state, regardless of population or size, has two senators, so currently, there are 100 senators for the 50 states.\\nArticle One of the U.S. Constitution requires that members of Congress must be at least 25 years old House or at least 30 years old Senate, have been a citizen of the U.S. for seven House or nine Senate years, and be an inhabitant of the state which they represent. Members in both chambers may stand for re-election an unlimited number of times.\\nThe Congress was created by the U.S. Constitution and first met in 1789, replacing the Congress of the Confederation in its legislative function. Although not legally mandated, in practice since the 19th century, Congress members are typically affiliated with one of the two major parties, the Democratic Party or the Republican Party, and only rarely with a third party or independents affiliated with no party. In the case of the latter, the lack of affiliation with a political party does not mean that such members are unable to caucus with members of the political parties. Members can also switch parties at any time, although this is quite uncommon."

An African American church leader and the son of early civil rights activist and minister Martin Luther King Sr., King advanced civil rights for people of color in the United States through nonviolence and civil disobedience. Inspired by his Christian beliefs and the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi, he led targeted, nonviolent resistance against Jim Crow laws and other forms of discrimination.\\nKing participated in and led marches for the right to vote, desegregation, labor rights, and other civil rights. He oversaw the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and later became the first president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference SCLC. As president of the SCLC, he led the unsuccessful Albany Movement in Albany, Georgia, and helped organize some of the nonviolent 1963 protests in Birmingham, Alabama. King was one of the leaders of the 1963 March on Washington, where he delivered his I Have a Dream speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. The civil rights movement achieved pivotal legislative gains in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968.\\nThe SCLC put into practice the tactics of nonviolent protest with some success by strategically choosing the methods and places in which protests were carried out. There were several dramatic standoffs with segregationist authorities, who sometimes turned violent. Several times King would be jailed. Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover considered King a radical and made him an object of the FBIs COINTELPRO from 1963 forward. FBI agents investigated him for possible communist ties, spied on his personal life, and secretly recorded him. The FBI in 1964 mailed King a threatening anonymous letter, which he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide.On October 14, 1964, King won the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality through nonviolent resistance. In 1965, he helped organize two of the three Selma to Montgomery marches. In his final years, he expanded his focus to include opposition towards poverty, capitalism, and the Vietnam War. In 1968, King was planning a national occupation of Washington, D.C., to be called the Poor Peoples Campaign, when he was assassinated on April 4 in Memphis, Tennessee. His death was followed by national mourning, as well as anger leading to riots in many U.S. cities. King was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2003. Martin Luther King Jr. Day was established as a holiday in cities and states throughout the United States beginning in 1971; the holiday was enacted at the federal level by legislation signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986. Hundreds of streets in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, and the most populous county in Washington State was rededicated for him. The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., was dedicated in 2011."

The character debuted on-screen during the episode broadcast on 22 July 1991. Susannah was created as the ex-wife of established character Max Farnham Steven Pinder and writers instantly used her to create problems in Maxs marriage to Patricia Farnham Gabrielle Glaister. Susannahs feud with Patricia and desire to reunite with Max formed the basis of her early storylines. Susannahs initial characterisation was only that of a mean, disgruntled ex-spouse but Drury decided to play her more sweet and snobbish. Susannahs persona allowed writers the versatility to create both tragic and comedic stories for her. Susannahs tragedies were formed via her difficult marriage to Max, family bereavements and poor mental health. Writers later transformed her into a promiscuous and scheming woman which gained her infamy in the British press. \\nWhen Drury returned to the series in 1995, writers reunited her with Max and explored the Farnhams running their restaurant business alongside their continued relationship problems. Producers then created dramatic plots for Susannah because Drury was considering leaving Brookside. Writers explored the issues of child bereavement and road safety when they killed off her two children Matthew and Emily in a car crash with Susannah at the wheel. The story featured various repercussions for the character with a decline in her mental health, an attempted suicide and gradual acceptance of their deaths. Series creator Phil Redmond was keen for Brookside to portray the issue of surrogacy because it was heavily featured in the British media at the time. Susannah is told she cannot have any more children and enlists Jacqui Dixon Alex Fletcher to become a surrogate mother. Writers complicated the plot with Susannah actually becoming pregnant and later giving birth to a daughter, Emma. This created a long-running feud between Jacqui over the custody of her surrogate son Harry.\\nOther stories include Maxs affair with Faye Spence Joanne Zorian and their divorce. Susannah then has affairs with Greg Shadwick Mark Moraghan, Darren Roebuck Timothy Deenihan and a relationship with Mick Johnson Louis Emerick. Susannah had fully transformed into a promiscuous and man-eating character. Writers devised a mystery Whodunit death storyline to coincide with Drurys departure from the show. The show created five suspects with Max eventually being revealed as the culprit after he pushes her down the stairs. Susannahs legacy became her being regarded as one of Brooksides most iconic and dramatic characters. Her promiscuity gained her a reputation of being a man-eater and a nymphomaniac in British newspapers. Drurys acting received positive reviews, especially during her tragic stories. Susannahs car crash and her death have been cited as some of the shows most memorable stories by television critics."

However, it was soon evident that she lacked in talent. She developed a crush on Kevin Fisher Greg Rikaart, which she takes to extreme heights, conning him into a short-lived marriage with the help of her father. Angelina eventually achieved her musical dream, having released a song entitled Good Goodbye which was written and produced by DeGarmo. The song was about how the character evolved into a better person when she left, and detailed her emotional journey. DeGarmo said that she had finally gotten rid of her selfish ways and expressed this through music. After a five-month stint on the series, on March 27, 2012, Angelina left Genoa City to further pursue her music career in Los Angeles.

Adult contemporary is generally a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of pop/rock music.Adult contemporary tends to have lush, soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on melody and harmonies is accentuated. It is usually melodic enough to get a listeners attention, and is inoffensive and pleasurable enough to work well as background music. Like most of pop music, its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a versechorus structure. The format is heavy on romantic sentimental ballads which mostly use acoustic instruments though bass guitar is usually used such as acoustic guitars, pianos, saxophones, and sometimes an orchestral set. The electric guitars are normally faint and high-pitched. However, recent adult contemporary music may feature synthesizers and other electronics, such as drum machines.An AC radio station may play mainstream music, but it usually excludes hip-hop and some forms of dance-pop and teen pop, as these are less popular among adults, the target demographic. AC radio often targets the 2544 age group, the demographic that has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s. A common practice in recent years of adult contemporary stations is to play less newer music and more hits of the past. This de-emphasis on new songs slows the progression of the AC chart.Over the years, AC has spawned subgenres including hot AC also known as modern AC, soft AC also known as lite AC, urban AC a softer type of urban contemporary music, rhythmic AC a softer type of rhythmic contemporary, and Christian AC a softer type of contemporary Christian music. Some stations play only hot AC, soft AC, or only one of the variety of subgenres. Therefore, it is not usually considered a specific genre of music; it is merely an assemblage of selected songs from artists of many different genres."

            "Valene Ewing, Valene Val Ewing maiden name Clements, formerly Gibson, Waleska, portrayed by Joan Van Ark, is a fictional character in the CBS primetime soap opera Knots Landing, a spin-off from the long-running series Dallas, in which she also appeared. The character originated on Dallas in 1978 as the mother of Lucy Ewing and ex-wife of Gary Ewing the second son of oil baron Jock and Miss Ellie Ewing. Van Ark made several guest appearances on Dallas before becoming one of the main stars of the spin-off Knots Landing in December 1979, though she continued to make small appearances in Dallas for the next several years. Van Ark played Valene in Knots Landing for thirteen of its fourteen seasons, which made her one of the shows longest running stars. The character made her last Knots Landing appearance in 1997, when she appeared in the reunion miniseries Knots Landing: Back to the Cul-de-Sac. In 2013, Van Ark reprised her character for the new, updated version of Dallas.Valenes storyline in her first two episodes on Dallas focuses on the rebuilding of her relationship with estranged ex-husband Gary Ewing. When Valene arrives in Texas to find her daughter, Lucy Ewing, she is brought back into the drama of the Ewing family. Upon arrival, she is reunited with Gary with whom she slowly falls back in love. Once Dallas became a hit, series creator David Jacobs proceeded to launch a spin-off series titled Knots Landing, which would feature Valene and Gary prominently. The actress had strong input on how they would create her character outline. She recalled, I remember going to wardrobe and getting a peachy pink waitress uniform, and the shoes. And then I was trying to get that Texas sound, her all important accent. And so we created her layer by layer.Van Ark received positive reviews for her portrayal of Valene, and received two Soap Opera Digest award nominations in the category Outstanding Actress in a Leading Role on a Prime Time Serial. Greg Hernandez said, Her character of Valene was a best-selling author, but her personal life was always a mess. She had her husband, Gary, stolen by another woman, then got pregnant by him, her twin babies were kidnapped by a crooked doctor, she was given a drug overdose at gunpoint by her ex-husbands fiancee, and she racked up enough marriages to give Elizabeth Taylor a run for her money. But she and Gary Ewing Ted Shackelford made for one of televisions most beloved couples and the audience never stopped rooting for them to get back together."

Katarina was conceived as a permanent companion but this was quickly re-evaluated by the writers, including producer John Wiles, as they realised the writing challenges that came with such an unworldly character. Unable to remove the character from upcoming scripts at short notice, they decided to write out Katarina by killing her early in The Daleks Master Plan, her second story, making her the first companion in the series to die. Katarinas death was the first scene Hill filmed for the series.Her role as companion in The Daleks Master Plan was given to the character of Sara Kingdom, who was also killed off in the same story."

However, it is more widely accepted that the Pacific War itself began on 7 December 8 December Japanese time 1941, when the Japanese simultaneously invaded Thailand, attacked the British colonies of Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong as well as the United States military and naval bases in Hawaii, Wake Island, Guam, and the Philippines.The Pacific War saw the Allies pitted against Japan, the latter aided by Thailand and to a lesser extent by the Axis allies, Germany and Italy. Fighting consisted of some of the largest naval battles in history, and incredibly fierce battles and war crimes across Asia and the Pacific Islands, resulting in immense loss of human life. The war culminated in massive Allied air raids over Japan, and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, accompanied by the Soviet Unions declaration of war and invasion of Manchuria and other territories on 9 August 1945, causing the Japanese to announce an intent to surrender on 15 August 1945. The formal surrender of Japan ceremony took place aboard the battleship USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945. After the war, Japan lost all rights and titles to its former possessions in Asia and the Pacific, and its sovereignty was limited to the four main home islands and other minor islands as determined by the Allies.

            "Western culture, Western culture, also known as Western civilization, Occidental culture, or Western society, is the heritage of social norms, ethical values, traditional customs, belief systems, political systems, artifacts and technologies of the Western world. The term applies beyond Europe to countries and cultures whose histories are strongly connected to Europe by immigration, colonization or influence. Western culture is most strongly influenced by Greco-Roman culture, Germanic culture, and Christian culture.The expansion of Greek culture into the Hellenistic world of the eastern Mediterranean led to a synthesis between Greek and Near-Eastern cultures, and major advances in literature, engineering, and science, and provided the culture for the expansion of early Christianity and the Greek New Testament. This period overlapped with and was followed by Rome, which made key contributions in law, government, engineering and political organization.Western culture is characterized by a host of artistic, philosophic, literary and legal themes and traditions. Christianity, primarily the Roman Catholic Church, and later Protestantism has played a prominent role in the shaping of Western civilization since at least the 4th century, as did Judaism. A cornerstone of Western thought, beginning in ancient Greece and continuing through the Middle Ages and Renaissance, is the idea of rationalism in various spheres of life developed by Hellenistic philosophy, scholasticism and humanism. Empiricism later gave rise to the scientific method, the scientific revolution, and the Age of Enlightenment.\\nWestern culture continued to develop with the Christianization of European society during the Middle Ages, the reforms triggered by the medieval renaissances, the influence of the Islamic world via Al-Andalus and Sicily including the transfer of technology from the East, and Latin translations of Arabic texts on science and philosophy by Greek and Hellenic-influenced Islamic philosophers, and the Italian Renaissance as Greek scholars fleeing the fall of the Byzantine Empire after the Muslim conquest of Constantinople brought classical traditions and philosophy. This major change for non-western countries and their people saw a development in modernization into those non-western countries. Medieval Christianity is credited with creating the modern university, the modern hospital system, scientific economics, and natural law which would later influence the creation of international law. Christianity played a role in ending practices common among pagan societies, such as human sacrifice, slavery, infanticide and polygamy. European culture developed with a complex range of philosophy, medieval scholasticism, mysticism and Christian and secular humanism. Rational thinking developed through a long age of change and formation, with the experiments of the Enlightenment and breakthroughs in the sciences. Tendencies that have come to define modern Western societies include the concept of political pluralism, individualism, prominent subcultures or countercultures such as New Age movements and increasing cultural syncretism resulting from globalization and human migration."

In Japan, the mobile phone version was initially titled Final Fantasy IV the After: Tsuki no Kikan but later releases have since adopted the Western title, renaming the game to Final Fantasy IV The After Years: Tsuki no Kikan. The game was remade in 3D for the Android and iOS platforms using the same style as the Nintendo DS version of Final Fantasy IV, and was later released for Microsoft Windows."

When she is ultimately willing to leave Mark for him, House tells her to go back to Mark, which devastates her and causes her and Mark to leave the city.\\nWhen the writers of the show wrote Three Stories, the first episode in which Stacy appeared, the first name they came up with to play the character was Sela Ward. Although Ward was not initially interested in portraying Stacy, she changed her mind after watching tapes of the show. While she was originally hired to appear in only two episodes of the first season, the chemistry between Ward and Laurie was strong enough to have her appear in seven more second season episodes. She also appeared in the House finale Everybody Dies. Stacy was received mostly positively by critics who considered her arc a juicy subplot."

The origin of the Alpine race was variously identified. Ripley argued that it migrated from Central Asia during the Neolithic revolution, splitting the Nordic and Mediterranean populations. It was also identified as descending from the Celts residing in Central Europe in Neolithic times. The Alpine race is mainly distinguished by its moderate stature, neotenous features, and cranial measurements, such as high cephalic index.With the rise of modern genetics, the concept of distinct human races in a biological sense has become obsolete. In 2019, the American Association of Biological Anthropologists stated: The belief in races as natural aspects of human biology, and the structures of inequality racism that emerge from such beliefs, are among the most damaging elements in the human experience both today and in the past."

The character appears in every episode of the fourth series in addition to a prequel novel, The Men Who Sold the World.\\nWithin the series narrative, Esther is a Central Intelligence Agency CIA watch analyst who becomes aware of the defunct British Torchwood Institute on Miracle Day, when it is discovered that no one can die. Alongside her CIA colleague Rex Matheson she joins forces with the last two remaining Torchwood agents to investigate the phenomenon. Esthers standing as a desk-bound computer and technology expert puts her in contrast with the tougher and more action-orientated characters in the series. By the Miracle Day finale, Esther has become a more competent field agent, but is murdered by the groups enemies in an attempt to stop them progressing with their mission.\\nHavins was influenced in her decision to accept the part by her husbands appreciation of the series. Like Rex, Esther is used by executive producer Russell T Davies as a means of introducing new American audiences to the established mythos of Torchwood. Havins stated the character to have an unrequited love for Rex, but explained that he does not appear to notice. Response to the character varied; some critics praised her characterisation and portrayal whilst others felt her to display incompetency and to not have been taken to by the audience.

The first episode was recorded at the BBC on 7 September 1969 and premiered on 5 October on BBC1, with 45 episodes airing over four series from 1969 to 1974, plus two episodes for German TV.\\nThe series stands out for its use of absurd situations, mixed with risqu and innuendo-laden humour, sight gags and observational sketches without punchlines. Live action segments were broken up with animations by Gilliam, often merging with the live action to form segues. The overall format used for the series followed and elaborated upon the style used by Spike Milligan in his groundbreaking series Q., rather than the traditional sketch show format. The Pythons play the majority of the series characters themselves, along with supporting cast members including Carol Cleveland referred to by the team as the unofficial Seventh Python, Connie Booth Cleeses first wife, series producer Ian MacNaughton, Ian Davidson, musician Neil Innes, and Fred Tomlinson and the Fred Tomlinson Singers for musical numbers.The programme came about as the six Pythons, having met each other through university and in various radio and television programmes in the 1960s, sought to make a new sketch comedy show unlike anything else on British television at the time. Much of the humour in the series various episodes and sketches targets the idiosyncrasies of British life, especially that of professionals, as well as aspects of politics. Their comedy is often pointedly intellectual, with numerous erudite references to philosophers and literary figures and their works. The team intended their humour to be impossible to categorise, and succeeded although, by their perspective, failed so completely that the adjective Pythonesque was invented to define it and, later, similar material. However, their humour was not always seen as appropriate for television by the BBC, leading to some censorship during the third series. Cleese left the show following that series, and the remaining Pythons completed a final shortened fourth series before ending the show.\\nThe show became very popular in the United Kingdom, and after initially failing to draw an audience in the United States, gained American popularity after member stations of PBS Public Broadcasting Service began airing the show in 1974. The success on both sides of the Atlantic led to the Pythons going on live tours and creating three additional films, while the individual Pythons flourished in solo careers. Monty Pythons Flying Circus has become an influential work on comedy as well as the ongoing popular culture.\\n\\n"

            "Mercedes McQueen, Mercedes McQueen also Owen, Fisher and Browning is a fictional character from the British Channel 4 soap opera Hollyoaks, played by Jennifer Metcalfe. She debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 19 June 2006 as the first character to be introduced to the series by series producer, Bryan Kirkwood. In 2008 Metcalfe feared that the character was to be axed but was later reassured by the series producer that she would not be. Metcalfe later stated her intention to stay with the series. Mercedes is part of the McQueen family and is the longest serving McQueen on the series. On 26 August 2014, it was revealed that Metcalfe had decided to quit the soap. On 20 November 2014, Mercedes was presumably stabbed to death, with her body discarded. However, Metcalfe returned to screens on 17 February 2015 in a surprise, unannounced twist which saw Mercedes revealed as alive and well, living in Nice, France. It was announced that Mercedes would make a full-time return to the show in May 2015, after brief appearances on 18 February, 9 March, and 6 April. Metcalfe announced her pregnancy in 2017 and revealed that she would be taking a years break from the show. Mercedes was last seen on screen leaving with Goldie McQueen Chelsee Healey on 4 July 2017, although she briefly appeared on 7 September 2017 in a fake flashback scene involving her and Amy Barnes Ashley Slanina-Davies surmised by James Nightingale Gregory Finnegan. Mercedes returned on 9 July 2018, and then made several other appearances before returning permanently on 13 August.\\nMercedes is described as a savvy, ballsy girl that cant say no and is unapologetic about it. She is played as having moments of happiness which she ruins for herself and as managing to justify whatever she does thats bad. Throughout her time on the series, Mercedes storylines have centered on her relationships. These include her marriages to Russ Owen Stuart Manning, Malachy Fisher Glen Wallace and Dr. Paul Browning Joseph Thompson, with her second marriage involving her in an HIV storyline, an engagement to Riley Costello Rob Norbury and a committed relationship with Joe Roscoe Ayden Callaghan. She has also been central to several affairs which included Calvin Valentine Ricky Whittle, her sisters husband, and Rileys father Carl Paul Opacic. Following the revelation of her affair with Carl on her wedding day to Riley, Mercedes was at the centre of a kidnapping storyline when she was held against her will by Rileys serial killer grandfather, Silas Blissett Jeff Rawle, before going into labour, giving birth to a boy as a result of the stress. Following her ordeal Mercedes briefly turned to prostitution. When Mitzeee Rachel Shenton grows close to Riley, Mercedes begins to stalk her. During the culmination of the plot, in pure desperation Mercedes stabs herself and Mitzeee is blamed. Mercedes friend, Lynsey Nolan Karen Hassan, discovers Mercedes stalking of Mitzeee and stabbing of herself. Lynsey is later murdered in a whodunit storyline with Mercedes becoming a suspect in her murder. It is later revealed Mercedes partner Doctor Browning killed Lynsey to protect Mercedes and in October 2013, Mercedes, Cindy Cunningham Stephanie Waring and Lindsey Butterfield Sophie Austin attacked, murdered and covered up the murder of Doctor Browning. In the run-up to her 2014 departure, Mercedes was involved in feuds with Freddie Roscoe Charlie Clapham and Grace Black Tamara Wall and mourning for her sister Carmel Gemma Merna following a train crash, which Mercedes was also involved in. Since her return in February 2015, her storylines have included reuniting with her family, her relationship with Joe and delivering a stillborn son named Gabriel, exposing Lindsey as the Gloved Hand Killer, Silas returning and targeting her again, and her feud with Joanne Cardsley Rachel Leskovac over Joe, who later dies during the shows Halloween Spooktacular episodes. In late 2019, the character finds herself at the centre of another whodunit storyline, Who Shot Mercedes?, where she is shot having angered numerous residents.\\nMetcalfe has received numerous awards and nominations for her portrayal of Mercedes. Metcalfe has been praised by the British press for her performance in the role. The character has also been praised and criticised by the British press, for her numerous relationships and affairs, her appearance, her status as a slapper and her penchant for finding herself in terrifying situations."

There was also a Per-Wadjet in Upper Egypt.\\nWadjet was said to be the matron and protector of Lower Egypt, and upon unification with Upper Egypt, the joint protector and patron of all of Egypt. The image of Wadjet with the sun disk is called the uraeus, and it was the emblem on the crown of the rulers of Lower Egypt. She was also the protector of kings and of women in childbirth. Wadjet was said to be the nurse of the infant god Horus. With the help of his mother Isis, they protected Horus from his treacherous uncle, Set, when they took refuge in the swamps of the Nile Delta.Wadjet was closely associated in ancient Egyptian religion with the Eye of Ra, a powerful protective deity. The hieroglyph for her eye is shown below; sometimes two are shown in the sky of religious images. Per-Wadjet also contained a sanctuary of Horus, the child of the sun deity who would be interpreted to represent the pharaoh. Much later, Wadjet became associated with Isis as well as with many other deities.\\nIn the relief shown to the right, which is on the wall of the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut at Luxor, there are two images of Wadjet: one of her as the uraeus with her head through an ankh and another where she precedes a Horus hawk wearing the pschent, representing the pharaoh whom she protects."

According to some accounts, the creature uses either hypnosis or voice mimicry to lure trespassers onto the trestle to meet their death before an oncoming train. Other stories claim the monster jumps down from the trestle onto the roofs of cars passing beneath it. Yet other legends tell that it attacks its victims with a blood-stained axe and that the very sight of the creature is so unsettling that those who see it while walking across the high trestle are driven to leap off.\\nOther legends hold that the monster is a human-goat hybrid, and that it was a circus freak who vowed revenge after being mistreated. In one version, it is said the monster escaped after a train derailed on the trestle. Another version commonly told by locals of the area claims that the monster is really the twisted reincarnated form of a farmer who sacrificed goats in exchange for Satanic powers.The legends have turned the area into a site for legend tripping. There have been a number of deaths and accidents at the trestle since its construction, despite the presence of an 8-foot 2.4 m fence to keep thrill-seekers out.There is a common misconception that the trestle is abandoned and no longer used; in reality, the bridge carries a major rail artery into Louisville. Heavy freight trains cross the bridge several times daily, so it is easy for someone to get caught atop it while an oncoming train barrels down on them. Norfolk Southern Railway urged citizens not to climb the trestle, saying if caught they would be arrested.\\n\\n"

Because of the great secrecy surrounding the development and manufacturing of nuclear weapons, there is no proof that red mercury exists. However, all samples of alleged red mercury analyzed in the public literature have proven to be well-known, common red substances of no interest to weapons makers.Red mercury is therefore considered a hoax, perpetrated by con artists who sought to take advantage of gullible buyers on the black market for arms. There have been reports of red mercury on the international black markets since 1979, but the hoax seems to have been most common in the early 1990s, with very high asking prices."

            "Hold come what may, Hold come what may is a phrase popularized by logician Willard Van Orman Quine. Beliefs that are held come what may are beliefs one is unwilling to give up, regardless of any evidence with which one might be presented.Quine held that any belief can be held come what may, so long as one makes suitable adjustments to other beliefs. In other words, all beliefs are rationally revisable no statement is immune to revision. He used this to reject the distinction between analytic truths which are true come what may and synthetic truths which are true at least in part because of the state of the world.\\nMany philosophers argue to the contrary, believing that, for example, the laws of thought cannot be revised and may be held come what may. Quine believed that all beliefs are linked by a web of beliefs, in which a belief is linked to another belief by supporting relations, but if one belief is found untrue, there is ground to find the linked beliefs also untrue. The latter statement is usually referred to as either confirmation holism or DuhemQuine thesis.\\nA closely related concept is hold more stubbornly at least, also popularized by Quine. Some beliefs may be more useful than others, or may be implied by a large number of beliefs. Examples might be laws of logic, or the belief in an external world of physical objects. Altering such central portions of the web of beliefs would have immense, ramifying consequences, and affect many other beliefs. It is better to alter auxiliary beliefs around the edges of the web of beliefs considered to be sense beliefs, rather than main beliefs in the face of new evidence unfriendly to ones central principles. Thus, while one might agree that there is no belief one can hold come what may, there are some for which there is ample practical ground to hold more stubbornly at least."

The role marks the actress television debut. Initially portrayed as lazy and idle, Jades characterisation develops as she is shown to be an independent, caring and compassionate young woman. Jade is the dramas first disabled, and deaf, regular character; Leon is also deaf and used her personal experiences to develop her characters story. The character uses a combition of Sign Supported English SSE and lip reading to communicate. Producers and Leon were keen to not make her disability a defining feature of the character.\\nJade is introduced as a student nurse completing her final placement on Holby City Hospitals maternity ward. Senior nurse Louise Tyler Azuka Oforka recognises her talent and invites her to finish her placement at the emergency department ED, where writers paired her with Marty in a double act tackling their first months in the ED together. First used for light relief against the shows serious stories, the pair were later subject to more delicate stories as Jade becomes a registered nurse and Marty comes out to his family. Off-screen, Leon and Jafargholi liked working together and even moved in together.\\nThe characters biggest story explored her fictional backstory in foster care and deafness. Leon dubbed it a story of acceptance. One episode uses British Sign Language BSL in scenes between Jade and her former boyfriend, with subtitles used for non-BSL speakers. The story culminates in the special episode Jades World, written, directed and starring deaf creatives in a first for British history. The episode sees Jade meet her biological mother, Susie Ashby Sophie Leigh Stone, who she learns is also deaf. Jades World was lauded by television critics and viewers alike.\\nProducers used the character to highlight the issue of drink spiking and how people with disabilities face additional barriers daily. After having her drink spiked in a club, Jade is nearly assaulted in an alleyway. She is traumatised by the attack and initially seeks revenge. The characters reasons for becoming a nurse were explored in the shows thirty-sixth anniversary, followed by a revenge plot against Jade from Stevie Nash Elinor Lawless. Leon opted to leave Casualty after three years and Jade departs in the thirty-sixth series episode The Road Less Travelled, first broadcast on 18 September 2021.

            "Burger King, Burger King BK is an American-based multinational chain of hamburger fast food restaurants. Headquartered in Miami-Dade County, Florida, the company was founded in 1953 as Insta-Burger King, a Jacksonville, Floridabased restaurant chain. After Insta-Burger King ran into financial difficulties in 1954, its two Miami-based franchisees David Edgerton 19272018 and James McLamore 19261996 purchased the company and renamed it Burger King. Over the next half-century, the company changed hands four times and its third set of owners, a partnership of TPG Capital, Bain Capital, and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners took it public in 2002. In late 2010, 3G Capital of Brazil acquired a majority stake in the company, in a deal valued at US$3.26 billion. The new owners promptly initiated a restructuring of the company to reverse its fortunes. 3G, along with partner Berkshire Hathaway, eventually merged the company with the Canadian-based doughnut chain Tim Hortons, under the auspices of a new Canadian-based parent company named Restaurant Brands International.\\nThe 1970s were the Golden Age of the companys advertising, but beginning in the early 1980s, Burger King advertising began losing focus. A series of less successful advertising campaigns created by a procession of advertising agencies continued for the next two decades. In 2003, Burger King hired the Miami-based advertising agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky CP+B, which completely reorganized its advertising with a series of new campaigns centered on a redesigned Burger King character nicknamed The King, accompanied by a new online presence. While highly successful, some of CP+Bs commercials were derided for perceived sexism or cultural insensitivity. Burger Kings new owner, 3G Capital, later terminated the relationship with CP+B in 2011 and moved its advertising to McGarryBowen, to begin a new product-oriented campaign with expanded demographic targeting.\\nBurger Kings menu has expanded from a basic offering of burgers, French fries, sodas, and milkshakes to a larger and more diverse set of products. In 1957, the Whopper became the first major addition to the menu, and it has become Burger Kings signature product since. Conversely, Burger King has introduced many products which failed to catch hold in the marketplace. Some of these failures in the United States have seen success in foreign markets, where Burger King has also tailored its menu for regional tastes. From 2002 to 2010, Burger King aggressively targeted the 1834 male demographic with larger products that often carried correspondingly large amounts of unhealthy fats and trans-fats. This tactic would eventually damage the companys financial underpinnings, and cast a negative pall on its earnings. Beginning in 2011, the company began to move away from its previous male-oriented menu and introduce new menu items, product reformulations and packaging, as part of its current owner 3G Capitals restructuring plans of the company.As of December 31, 2018, Burger King reported that it had 17,796 outlets in 100 countries. Of these, nearly half are located in the United States, and 99.7% are privately owned and operated, with its new owners moving to an almost entirely franchised model in 2013. Burger King has historically used several variations of franchising to expand its operations. The manner in which the company licenses its franchisees varies depending on the region, with some regional franchises, known as master franchises, responsible for selling franchise sub-licenses on the companys behalf. Burger Kings relationship with its franchises has not always been harmonious. Occasional spats between the two have caused numerous issues, and in several instances, the companys and its licensees relations have degenerated into precedent-setting court cases. Burger Kings Australian franchise Hungry Jacks is the only franchise to operate under a different name, due to a trademark dispute and a series of legal cases between the two."

Situated on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea, it is one of the oldest cities in the world and is considered to be a holy city for the three major Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Both Israelis and Palestinians claim Jerusalem as their capital, as Israel maintains its primary governmental institutions there and the State of Palestine ultimately foresees it as its seat of power. Because of this dispute, neither claim is widely recognized internationally.Throughout its long history, Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice, besieged 23 times, captured and recaptured 44 times, and attacked 52 times. The part of Jerusalem called the City of David shows first signs of settlement in the 4th millennium BCE, in the shape of encampments of nomadic shepherds. During the Canaanite period 14th century BCE, Jerusalem was named as Urusalim on ancient Egyptian tablets, probably meaning City of Shalem after a Canaanite deity. During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE Iron Age II, and by the 8th century BCE, the city had developed into the religious and administrative centre of the Kingdom of Judah. In 1538, the city walls were rebuilt for a last time around Jerusalem under Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire. Today those walls define the Old City, which has been traditionally divided into four-quartersknown since the early 19th century as the Armenian, Christian, Jewish, and Muslim quarters. The Old City became a World Heritage Site in 1981, and is on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Since 1860, Jerusalem has grown far beyond the Old Citys boundaries. In 2015, Jerusalem had a population of some 850,000 residents, comprising approximately 200,000 secular Jewish Israelis, 350,000 Haredi Jews and 300,000 Palestinians. In 2016, the population was 882,700, of which Jews comprised 536,600 61%, Muslims 319,800 36%, Christians 15,800 2%, and 10,300 unclassified 1%.According to the Hebrew Bible, King David conquered the city from the Jebusites and established it as the capital of the United Kingdom of Israel, and his son, King Solomon, commissioned the building of the First Temple. Modern scholars argue that Jews branched out of the Canaanite peoples and culture through the development of a distinct monolatrousand later monotheisticreligion centred on El/Yahweh. These foundational events, straddling the dawn of the 1st millennium BCE, assumed central symbolic importance for the Jewish people. The sobriquet of holy city Hebrew: , romanized: Ir ha-Qodesh was probably attached to Jerusalem in post-exilic times. The holiness of Jerusalem in Christianity, conserved in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, which Christians adopted as their own Old Testament, was reinforced by the New Testament account of Jesuss crucifixion and resurrection there. In Sunni Islam, Jerusalem is the third-holiest city, after Mecca and Medina. The city was the first qibla, the standard direction for Muslim prayers salah, and in Islamic tradition, Muhammad made his Night Journey there in 621, ascending to heaven where he speaks to God, according to the Quran. As a result, despite having an area of only 0.9 km2 38 sq mi, the Old City is home to many sites of seminal religious importance, among them the Temple Mount with its Western Wall, Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.\\nToday, the status of Jerusalem remains one of the core issues in the IsraeliPalestinian conflict. During the 1948 ArabIsraeli War, West Jerusalem was among the areas captured and later annexed by Israel while East Jerusalem, including the Old City, was captured and later annexed by Jordan. Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan during the 1967 Six-Day War and subsequently effectively annexed it into Jerusalem, together with additional surrounding territory. One of Israels Basic Laws, the 1980 Jerusalem Law, refers to Jerusalem as the countrys undivided capital. All branches of the Israeli government are located in Jerusalem, including the Knesset Israels parliament, the residences of the Prime Minister Beit Aghion and President Beit HaNassi, and the Supreme Court. The international community rejects the annexation as illegal and treats East Jerusalem as Palestinian territory occupied by Israel."

Pool Dated 1913 in Hollywood Cemetery holds the remains of a vampire. Supposedly Pool was run out of England in the 1800s for being a vampire. Oral legends to this effect were circulating by the 1960s. They may be influenced by the architecture of the tomb, which has both Masonic and ancient Egyptian elements, and double Ws looking like fangs. Because this cemetery is adjacent to Virginia Commonwealth University, the story became popular among students, especially from the 1980s onward. It was first mentioned in print in the student newspaper Commonwealth Times in 1976.Since 2001, the vampire story has been combined with the collapse of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroads Church Hill Tunnel under Church Hill, a neighborhood of eastern Richmond, Virginia, which buried several workers alive on October 2, 1925. This part of the story showed up online in 2001 and was first reported in print in 2007 in Haunted Richmond: The Shadows of Shockoe.According to this newer story, the tunneling awakened an ancient evil that lived under Church Hill and brought the tunnel crashing down on the workers. Rescue teams found an unearthly blood-covered creature with jagged teeth and skin hanging from its muscular body crouching over one of the victims. The creature escaped from the cave-in and raced toward the James River. Pursued by a group of men, the creature took refuge in Hollywood Cemetery 2.2 miles away, where it disappeared in a mausoleum built into a hillside bearing the name W. W. Pool.\\nAccording to Gregory Maitland, an urban legend and folklore researcher with the paranormal research groups Night Shift and the Virginia Ghosts & Haunting Research Society, the creature that escaped the tunnel collapse was actually the 28-year-old railroad fireman, Benjamin F. Mosby 1896-1925, who had been shoveling coal into the firebox of a steam locomotive of a work train with no shirt on when the cave-in occurred and the boiler ruptured. Mosbys upper body was horribly scalded and several of his teeth were broken before he made his way through the opening of the tunnel. Witnesses reported he was in shock and layers of his skin were hanging from his body. He died later at Grace Hospital and was buried at Hollywood Cemetery."

The story takes place three months after the events of Resident Evil 2 1998 and the concurrent destruction of Raccoon City as seen in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis 1999. It follows Claire Redfield and her brother Chris Redfield in their efforts to survive a viral outbreak at a remote prison island in the Southern Ocean and a research facility in Antarctica. The game retains the traditional survival horror controls and gameplay of previous installments; however, unlike the pre-rendered backgrounds of previous games, Code: Veronica uses real-time 3D environments and dynamic camera movement.\\nAfter producer Shinji Mikami and his team learned they would be unable to port Resident Evil 2 to the Sega Saturn, they began development on an original game, which became Code: Veronica. Although labeled a spin-off, it was designed as the true sequel to Resident Evil 2; the title Resident Evil 3 was given to what was originally another spin-off game being developed in tandem for the PlayStation. Claire was designed with a tougher appearance than in Resident Evil 2, with the reason being her past experiences in Raccoon City built her toughness and confidence.

This is achieved through the use of gothic architecture and gothic art in addition to the writing style and story presentation.\\nCapcom announced Code: Veronica in August 1998 and released it in February 2000 after delays and a reduction in sales expectations due to the struggling Dreamcast platform. Sales were weak compared to other Resident Evil games, but strong compared to other Dreamcast games. Code Veronica received critical acclaim and has been considered both among the best Resident Evil games and Dreamcast games. Capcom released an updated version on PlayStation 2 and Dreamcast, Code: Veronica X. The revised version included new cutscenes which revealed more details about the story, and it was ported to the GameCube in addition to other platforms in later years. In September 2011, Capcom released a high-definition remastered version of Code: Veronica X for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Code: Veronica was adapted for Capcoms Gun Survivor series with Resident Evil Survivor 2 Code: Veronica 2002 and also later adapted for Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles 2009."

            "On Borrowed Time, On Borrowed Time is a 1939 film about the role death plays in life, and how humanity cannot live without it. It is adapted from Paul Osborns 1938 Broadway hit play. The play, based on a novel by Lawrence Edward Watkin, has been revived twice on Broadway since its original run.\\nThe story is a retelling of a Greek fable in which Death is tricked into climbing a pear tree which had been blessed by Saint Polycarp to trap anyone who was trying to steal an old womans pears. The opening credits attribute the tale to Geoffrey Chaucer. Mr. Chaucer liked the tale and believed itand so do we. If perchance you dont believe it, we respectfully insist that we and Mr. Chaucer must be right. Because faith still performs miracles and a good deed does find its just reward. According to TCM.com, this probably refers to Chaucers The Pardoners Tale.\\nSet in small-town America, the film stars Lionel Barrymore, Beulah Bondi and Sir Cedric Hardwicke. Barrymore plays crotchety wheelchair-using Julian Northrup Gramps, who smokes a smelly pipe, cherishes a smelly dog, prefers fishing to churchgoing, occasionally takes a nip of tonic and indulges in mild profanity. Barrymore had broken his hip twice and was reliant on a wheelchair at the time. Gramps and his wife, Nellie, played by Bondi, are raising their orphaned grandson, Pud, who adores his grandfather and mimics everything he does. Hardwicke plays Mr. Brink, the elegant and aloof personification of death."

Since exploration takes precedence over combat, Nintendo classifies the game as a first-person adventure rather than a first-person shooter. It was released in North America in November 2002, and in Japan and Europe the following year. One day before its North American release, Nintendo released the Game Boy Advance game Metroid Fusion, marking the return of the Metroid series after an eight-year hiatus following Super Metroid 1994.Metroid Prime is the first game in the Metroid Prime saga, which takes place between the original Metroid and Metroid II: Return of Samus. Like previous games in the series, Metroid Prime has a science fiction setting in which players control the bounty hunter and series protagonist, Samus Aran. The story follows Samus as she battles the Space Pirates and their biological experiments on the planet Tallon IV. The game was a collaboration between Retros staff in Austin, Texas, and Japanese Nintendo employees, including producers Shigeru Miyamoto and Kensuke Tanabe, the former of whom suggested the project after visiting Retros headquarters in 2000.\\nThe game garnered universal praise and commercial success, selling over 2.8 million units worldwide. It won a number of Game of the Year awards, and is regarded by many critics and gamers to be one of the greatest video games ever made, remaining one of the highest-rated games on Metacritic. In 2009, an enhanced version was released for the Wii as a stand-alone game in Japan, and as part of the Metroid Prime: Trilogy compilation internationally."

Mike was portrayed by Kenneth MacDonald, and appeared in the show from 1983 to 1996.\\nMike first appeared in Only Fools and Horses in the episode, Whos a Pretty Boy?, in which Del ingratiated himself with the new landlord by agreeing to a deal which would see Mike accept Dels 2,000 offer to re-decorate the pub, leaving them with 500 apiece and using the remaining 1,000 to pay Brendan OShaughnessy. With many scenes in subsequent episodes set in the Nags Head, Mike became a regular character.\\nFriendly but dull-witted, Mike was often on the receiving end of Dels shenanigans or attempts to sell his low-quality goods. He rarely managed to get to Del to pay off his bar tab or even to pay for his drinks as he ordered them. Among the goods he bought from Del were a hairdryer that was actually a paint stripper leaving Mike with severe burns to the head, a malfunctioning deep fryer and a faulty fax machine. On the other hand, he was quite happy to con people out of their money when he could, evidenced by one occasion where he sold Denzil a plate of beef stew for 1, then sold exactly the same thing to a yuppie for 2.50, calling it Boeuf Bourguignon.\\nWhen Kenneth MacDonald died in 2001, writer John Sullivan added a storyline to new episode If They Could See Us Now, which explained that Mike had been caught up in Del and Rodneys shady financial dealings and attempted to embezzle the brewery in order to cover his losses, for which he was imprisoned. Caf owner Sid took over Mikes position of landlord.\\nIn the 2015 book He Who Dares, a fictional Del Boy autobiography, it is said that Mikes prison sentence had been reduced and he had retired to the Isle of Wight to write a memoir of his time inside. Del had left him a number of messages, but had never received any responses."

The full sentence from Marx translates including italics as: Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.The quotation originates from the introduction of Marxs work A Contribution to the Critique of Hegels Philosophy of Right, which he started in 1843 but which was not published until after his death. The introduction to this work was published separately in 1844, in Marxs own journal DeutschFranzsische Jahrbcher, a collaboration with Arnold Ruge.

Originally released for the Sharp X68000, it was later ported to the FM Towns Marty, PC-9801, and Sega Mega CD. The player assumes the role of a passenger aboard a cruise liner named the Nostalgia that has been taken captive by a criminal looking for an artifact.\\nAfter completing Cocoron for the Famicom, Sur de Wave set out to make their next game much more ambitious and story-centric. It was designed by Kouichi Yotsui, who previously created Strider for Capcom. He chose to make the game a text-based adventure as he was a fan of the genre and felt it made for a much more engaging experience compared to the arcade games he was accustom to. Inspiration for the game was taken from the 1974 film The Juggernaut, as well as real-world events such as the Industrial Revolution, and various American spy novels and comic books.\\nThough Nostalgia 1907 received praise for its ambition and unique cinematic atmosphere, critics disliked its dialogue for being awkward and its lack of player interactivity making it boring to play. It was a commercial failure, putting Sur de Wave in an unrecoverable financial crisis shortly after its release. The game has since received a cult following."

He is a former Imperial sharpshooter turned mercenary who leads a crew in an attempt to rescue a prisoner from a New Republic prison transport ship. His team includes the shows protagonist, The Mandalorian, with whom he repeatedly clashes and ultimately betrays. The Mandalorian outsmarts him, resulting in Mayfelds arrest and imprisonment, though he is later released so that he can aid the Mandalorians efforts to rescue Grogu. As a result, the character evolves from a minor antagonist to an ally of the Mandalorian, with whom he eventually makes amends during their mission. \\nMayfeld is portrayed by actor and comedian Bill Burr, who was not a fan of Star Wars and repeatedly publicly mocked the franchise and its fans before he accepted the role. The Mandalorian creator Jon Favreau offered the part to Burr, believing his past criticism of the franchise would make his casting that much more amusing. Several reviewers have noted that Mayfelds sardonic personality and hard-edged sense of humor is similar to Burrs real-life comedic style. Burr was extremely impressed with the filming of The Mandalorian, complimenting the technical aspects of filming as well as the writing style of the series.\\nThe character of Mayfeld received a generally positive response from reviewers, with many complimenting Burrs performance and the humor the character brought to the series. Reviewers critical of Mayfeld felt the character was flat, underdeveloped, or too incompetent as a mercenary. Mayfeld received a more positive response for his appearance in second season episode Chapter 15: The Believer, which explored his character in more depth. Burr received a significant amount of mock outrage from fans for a scene in Chapter 6: The Prisoner, in which he dropped Grogu, the shows hugely popular breakout character."

Doreen was introduced as part of the new Corkhill family consisting of herself, husband Billy Corkhill John McArdle and their two children Tracy Justine Kerrigan and Rod Corkhill Jason Hope. Doreen was portrayed as the aspiring housewife who wants to buy her own home. Billy risks financial ruin to help Doreen get her ideal home on Brookside Close. She is characterised as competitive and wants to portray a positive family image to her neighbours. She is a shopaholic and over spender, a trait writers used to get the Corkhills into debt. Her behaviour causes the her family many problems, Billy begins committing fraud and robberies to fund their lifestyle.\\nFitzgerald decided to leave Brookside in 1987, citing exhaustion and issues with Doreens characterisation. Writers created a dramatic exit story for her in which her marriage ends and abandons her children. In 1988, producers requested that Fitzgerald return to the show. She eventually agreed to a later invitation and Doreen returned in July 1989. Doreens personality had been changed and she acknowledges that her earlier behaviour was wrong. She wants to resume her marriage, but Billy began a relationship with Sheila Grant Sue Johnston in her absence. The character was once again written out of the series following Doreen being unsuccessful in her aims to resume her marriage. Fitzgerald branded her departure a mistake and she believed that she had let real women like Doreen down. Television critics have praised Doreens realism, Gareth McLean from The Guardian opined that Doreen and Billy were a true representation of the Liverpudlian aspiring lower-middle-class. Matt Wolf from The Sacramento Bee stated that the Corkhills accurately portrayed the British working class."

A very hard, brittle, silvery-white transition metal of the platinum group, it is considered the second-densest naturally occurring metal after osmium with a density of 22.56 g/cm3 0.815 lb/cu in as defined by experimental X-ray crystallography. It is one of the most corrosion-resistant metals, even at temperatures as high as 2,000 C 3,630 F. However, corrosion-resistance is not quantifiable in absolute terms; although only certain molten salts and halogens are corrosive to solid iridium, finely divided iridium dust is much more reactive and can be flammable, whereas gold dust is not flammable but can be attacked by substances that iridium resists, such as aqua regia.\\nIridium was discovered in 1803 among insoluble impurities in natural platinum. Smithson Tennant, the primary discoverer, named it after the Greek goddess Iris, personification of the rainbow, because of the striking and diverse colors of its salts. Iridium is one of the rarest elements in Earths crust, with annual production and consumption of only 3 tonnes 6.6 thousand pounds. 191Ir and 193Ir are the only two naturally occurring isotopes of iridium, as well as the only stable isotopes; the latter is the more abundant.\\nThe dominant uses of iridium are the metal itself and its alloys, as in high-performance spark plugs, crucibles for recrystallization of semiconductors at high temperatures, and electrodes for the production of chlorine in the chloralkali process. Important compounds of iridium are chlorides and iodides in industrial catalysis. Iridium is a component of some OLEDs.\\nIridium is found in meteorites in much higher abundance than in the Earths crust. For this reason, the unusually high abundance of iridium in the clay layer at the CretaceousPaleogene boundary gave rise to the Alvarez hypothesis that the impact of a massive extraterrestrial object caused the extinction of dinosaurs and many other species 66 million years ago, now known to be produced by the impact that formed the Chicxulub crater. Similarly, an iridium anomaly in core samples from the Pacific Ocean suggested the Eltanin impact of about 2.5 million years ago.It is thought that the total amount of iridium in the planet Earth is much higher than that observed in crustal rocks, but as with other platinum-group metals, the high density and tendency of iridium to bond with iron caused most iridium to descend below the crust when the planet was young and still molten."

            "Right-hand rule, In mathematics and physics, the right-hand rule is a common mnemonic for understanding orientation of axes in three-dimensional space. It is also a convenient method for quickly finding the direction of a cross-product of 2 vectors.\\nMost of the various left-hand and right-hand rules arise from the fact that the three axes of three-dimensional space have two possible orientations. One can see this by holding ones hands outward and together, palms up, with the thumbs out-stretched to the right and left, and the fingers making a curling motion from straight outward to pointing upward. Note the picture to right is not an illustration of this. The curling motion of the fingers represents a movement from the first x axis to the second y axis; the third z axis can point along either thumb. Left-hand and right-hand rules arise when dealing with coordinate axes. The rule can be used to find the direction of the magnetic field, rotation, spirals, electromagnetic fields, mirror images, and enantiomers in mathematics and chemistry.\\nThe sequence is often: index finger, then middle finger, then thumb. However, two other sequences also work because they preserve the cycle:\\n\\nMiddle finger, then thumb, then index finger.\\nThumb, then index finger, then middle finger e.g., see the ninth series of the Swiss 200-francs banknote.\\n\\n"

            "The War of the Worlds, The War of the Worlds is a science fiction novel by English author H. G. Wells, first serialised in 1897 by Pearsons Magazine in the UK and by Cosmopolitan magazine in the US. The novels first appearance in hardcover was in 1898 from publisher William Heinemann of London. Written between 1895 and 1897, it is one of the earliest stories to detail a conflict between mankind and an extra-terrestrial race. The novel is the first-person narrative of both an unnamed protagonist in Surrey and of his younger brother in London as southern England is invaded by Martians. The novel is one of the most commented-on works in the science fiction canon.The books plot was similar to numerous works of invasion literature which were published around the same period, and has been variously interpreted as a commentary on the theory of evolution, British colonialism, and Victorian-era fears, superstitions and prejudices. Wells later noted that an inspiration for the plot was the catastrophic effect of European colonisation on the Aboriginal Tasmanians; some historians have argued that Wells wrote the book in part to encourage his readership to question the morality of imperialism. At the time of the books publication, it was classified as a scientific romance, like Wellss earlier novel The Time Machine.\\nThe War of the Worlds has been both popular having never been out of print and influential, spawning half a dozen feature films, radio dramas, a record album, various comic book adaptations, a number of television series, and sequels or parallel stories by other authors. It was memorably dramatised in a 1938 radio programme directed by and starring Orson Welles that allegedly caused public panic among listeners who did not know the books events were fictional. The novel has even influenced the work of scientists, notably Robert H. Goddard, who, inspired by the book, helped develop both the liquid-fuelled rocket and multistage rocket, which resulted in the Apollo 11 Moon landing 71 years later."

Published in 1953, it is the first James Bond book, and it paved the way for a further eleven novels and two short story collections by Fleming, followed by numerous continuation Bond novels by other authors.\\nThe story concerns the British secret agent James Bond, gambling at the casino in Royale-les-Eaux to bankrupt Le Chiffre, the treasurer of a French union and a member of the Russian secret service. Bond is supported in his endeavours by Vesper Lynd, a member of his own service, as well as Felix Leiter of the CIA and Ren Mathis of the French Deuxime Bureau. Fleming used his wartime experiences as a member of the Naval Intelligence Division, and the people he met during his work, to provide plot elements; the character of Bond also reflected many of Flemings personal tastes. Fleming wrote the draft in early 1952 at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica while awaiting his marriage. He was initially unsure whether the work was suitable for publication, but was assured by his friend, the novelist William Plomer, that the novel had promise.\\nWithin the spy storyline, Casino Royale deals with themes of Britains position in the world, particularly the relationship with the US in light of the defections to the Soviet Union of the British agents Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean. The book was given broadly positive reviews by critics at the time and sold out in less than a month after its UK release on 13 April 1953, although US sales upon release a year later were much slower.\\nSince publication Casino Royale has appeared as a comic strip in The Daily Express, and been adapted for the screen three times: a 1954 episode of the CBS television series Climax! with Barry Nelson as an American Bond, a 1967 film version with David Niven playing Sir James Bond, and a 2006 film in the Eon Productions film series starring Daniel Craig as James Bond."

Despite Roses willingness to accept Adam as a fellow traveller, the Doctor is sceptical. After Adam attempts to use information from the future for his own gain, the Doctor throws Adam out of his time machine, the TARDIS. This was the first example of the Doctor forcing a companion to leave because of negative behaviour.\\nAdam was created during executive producer Russell T Davies original pitch to the BBC as part of his plans to revive Doctor Who for the channel. Though established early in the series planning, Adam was always intended to be a short-term character. Though reviewers generally reacted negatively to the character, Adams role as a foil to the stock companion figure has been praised alongside the moral lessons of his departure."

The phrase derives from an ancient belief that crocodiles shed tears while consuming their prey, and as such is present in many modern languages, especially in Europe where it was introduced through Latin. While crocodiles do have tear ducts, they weep to lubricate their eyes, typically when they have been out of water for a long time and their eyes begin to dry out. However, evidence suggests this could also be triggered by feeding.\\nBogorads syndrome, a condition which causes sufferers to shed tears while consuming food, has been labelled crocodile tears syndrome in reference to the legend."

The group are currently composed of Anthony Field, Lachlan Gillespie, Simon Pryce and Tsehay Hawkins, as well as supporting members Evie Ferris, John Pearce, Caterina Mete and Lucia Field. The Wiggles were founded in 1991 by Field, Murray Cook, Jeff Fatt, Greg Page and Phillip Wilcher. Wilcher left the group after their first album. Page retired in 2006 due to ill health and was replaced by understudy Sam Moran, but returned in 2012, replacing Moran. At the end of 2012, Cook, Fatt and Page retired and were replaced by Gillespie, Pryce and Emma Watkins. Cook and Fatt retained their shareholding in the group and all three continued to have input into its creative and production aspects. Watkins departed the group in 2021, with Hawkins taking her place.\\nField and Fatt were members of the Australian pop band the Cockroaches in the 1980s, and Cook was a member of several bands before meeting Field and Page at Macquarie University, where they were studying to become pre-school teachers. In 1991, Field was inspired to create an album of childrens music based upon concepts of early childhood education, and he enlisted Cook, Page, and Fatt to assist him. They began touring to promote the album and became so successful, they quit their teaching jobs to perform full-time. The group augmented their act with costumed characters Dorothy the Dinosaur, Henry the Octopus and Wags the Dog, as well as the human character Captain Feathersword, played by Paul Paddick since 1993. Shirley Shawn the Unicorn was later introduced. They originally travelled with a small group of dancers, which later grew into a larger troupe. The groups albums, DVDs and television programs have been produced independently since their inception. The height of their popularity came in the early 2000s, after they broke into the American market.\\nThe group were formally consolidated in 2005. They were listed at the top of Business Review Weeklys top-earning Australian entertainers four years in a row and earned A$45 million in 2009. In 2011, the worldwide recession hit the Wiggles, as it had done for many Australian entertainers; they earned $28 million, but they still appeared second on BRWs list that year. The Wiggles have enjoyed almost universal approval throughout their history, and their music has been played in pre-schools all over the world.

It first aired on February 28, 2016, as part of the third episode of Last Week Tonights third season, when Trump was the frontrunner for the Republican Party nomination for the presidency. During the 22-minute segment, comedian John Oliver discusses Trumps 2016 presidential campaign and his career in business. Oliver outlines Trumps campaign rhetoric, varying political positions, and failed business ventures. The comedian also criticizes Trump for making offensive and false statements, and says the Trump family name was changed at one point from the ancestral name Drumpf.\\nThe satirical segment went viral on YouTube and Facebook. By Super Tuesday on March 1, two days after broadcast, Google searches for Donald Drumpf had surpassed those for both Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, who were then competing against Trump for the Republican Party nomination. In eight days, the segment accumulated 19 million views on YouTube, making it Last Week Tonights most popular segment there. By the end of March, it had received a combined 85 million views on YouTube and Facebook.\\nThe segment popularized the term Donald Drumpf, a name for Trump that Oliver uses toward the end of the segment. Oliver intended the term to uncouple the grandeur of the Trump name so the latters supporters could acknowledge his political and entrepreneurial flaws. The comedian promoted a campaign urging viewers to Make Donald Drumpf Again, a play on Trumps Make America Great Again campaign slogan. Oliver coined a hashtag and registered a web domain to promote the term; the website offered a Google Chrome extension to change instances of Trump to Drumpf and sold baseball caps with the slogan Make Donald Drumpf Again.\\nThe segment started a public debate on when the Trump family renamed themselves from Drumpf. Commentators debated whether the family changed their name in the 17th or 19th century but agreed that neither Donald Trump nor his father Fred ever carried the surname Drumpf. Reviews of the segment itself were mixed: some praised the segment for being funny and informational, but others criticized Oliver for the possible xenophobic undertones attached to mocking the Drumpf surname. Oliver stopped using the name Drumpf in subsequent segments, saying the joke went out of hand."

He is often considered one of the most important rulers in Wallachian history and a national hero of Romania.He was the second son of Vlad Dracul, who became the ruler of Wallachia in 1436. Vlad and his younger brother, Radu, were held as hostages in the Ottoman Empire in 1442 to secure their fathers loyalty. Vlads eldest brother Mircea and their father were murdered after John Hunyadi, regent-governor of Hungary, invaded Wallachia in 1447. Hunyadi installed Vlads second cousin, Vladislav II, as the new voivode. Hunyadi launched a military campaign against the Ottomans in the autumn of 1448, and Vladislav accompanied him. Vlad broke into Wallachia with Ottoman support in October, but Vladislav returned and Vlad sought refuge in the Ottoman Empire before the end of the year. Vlad went to Moldavia in 1449 or 1450, and later to Hungary.\\nRelations between Hungary and Vladislav later deteriorated, and in 1456 Vlad invaded Wallachia with Hungarian support. Vladislav died fighting against him. Vlad began a purge among the Wallachian boyars to strengthen his position. He came into conflict with the Transylvanian Saxons, who supported his opponents, Dan and Basarab Laiot who were Vladislavs brothers, and Vlads illegitimate half-brother, Vlad Clugrul. Vlad plundered the Saxon villages, taking the captured people to Wallachia where he had them impaled which inspired his cognomen. Peace was restored in 1460.\\nThe Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed II, ordered Vlad to pay homage to him personally, but Vlad had the Sultans two envoys captured and impaled. In February 1462, he attacked Ottoman territory, massacring tens of thousands of Turks and Bulgarians. Mehmed launched a campaign against Wallachia to replace Vlad with Vlads younger brother, Radu. Vlad attempted to capture the sultan at Trgovite during the night of 1617 June 1462. The sultan and the main Ottoman army left Wallachia, but more and more Wallachians deserted to Radu. Vlad went to Transylvania to seek assistance from Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, in late 1462, but Corvinus had him imprisoned.\\nVlad was held in captivity in Visegrd from 1463 to 1475. During this period, anecdotes about his cruelty started to spread in Germany and Italy. He was released at the request of Stephen III of Moldavia in the summer of 1475. He fought in Corvinuss army against the Ottomans in Bosnia in early 1476. Hungarian and Moldavian troops helped him to force Basarab Laiot who had dethroned Vlads brother, Radu to flee from Wallachia in November. Basarab returned with Ottoman support before the end of the year. Vlad was killed in battle before 10 January 1477. Books describing Vlads cruel acts were among the first bestsellers in the German-speaking territories. In Russia, popular stories suggested that Vlad was able to strengthen his central government only through applying brutal punishments, and a similar view was adopted by most Romanian historians in the 19th century. Vlads patronymic inspired the name of Bram Stokers literary vampire, Count Dracula.\\n\\n"

When they ran out of livestock and trinkets for the dragon, they started giving up a human tribute once a year. This was acceptable to the villagers until a princess was chosen as the next offering. The saint thereupon rescues the princess chosen as the next offering. The narrative was first set in Cappadocia in the earliest sources of the 11th and 12th centuries, but transferred to Libya in the 13th-century Golden Legend.The narrative has pre-Christian origins Jason and Medea, Perseus and Andromeda, Typhon, etc., and is recorded in various saints lives prior to its attribution to St. George specifically. It was particularly attributed to Saint Theodore Tiro in the 9th and 10th centuries, and was first transferred to Saint George in the 11th century. The oldest known record of Saint George slaying a dragon is found in a Georgian text of the 11th century.The legend and iconography spread rapidly through the Byzantine cultural sphere in the 12th century. It reached Western Christian tradition still in the 12th century, via the crusades. The knights of the First Crusade believed that St. George, along with his fellow soldier-saints Demetrius, Maurice, Theodore and Mercurius had fought alongside them at Antioch and Jerusalem. The legend was popularised in Western tradition in the 13th century based on its Latin versions in the Speculum Historiale and the Golden Legend. At first limited to the courtly setting of Chivalric romance, the legend was popularised in the 13th century and became a favourite literary and pictorial subject in the Late Middle Ages and Renaissance, and it has become an integral part of the Christian traditions relating to Saint George in both Eastern and Western tradition."

            "Bullfighting, Bullfighting is a physical contest that involves a bullfighter attempting to subdue, immobilize, or kill a bull, usually according to a set of rules, guidelines, or cultural expectations.\\nThere are several variations, including some forms which involve dancing around or leaping over a cow or bull or attempting to grasp an object tied to the animals horns. The best-known form of bullfighting is Spanish-style bullfighting, practiced in Spain, Portugal, Southern France, Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Peru. The Spanish Fighting Bull is bred for its aggression and physique, and is raised free-range with little human contact.\\nThe practice of bullfighting is controversial because of a range of concerns including animal welfare, funding, and religion. While some forms are considered a blood sport, in some countries, for example Spain, it is defined as an art form or cultural event, and local regulations define it as a cultural event or heritage. Bullfighting is illegal in most countries, but remains legal in most areas of Spain and Portugal, as well as in some Hispanic American countries and some parts of southern France.\\n\\n"

            "Titanic 1997 film, Titanic is a 1997 American epic romance and disaster film directed, written, produced, and co-edited by James Cameron. Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, it is based on accounts of the sinking of the RMS Titanic and stars Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage. Also starring are Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, and Bill Paxton.\\nCamerons inspiration for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks; he felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began on September 1, 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the actual Titanic wreck. The modern scenes on the research vessel were shot on board the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. Scale models, computer-generated imagery, and a reconstruction of the Titanic built at Baja Studios were used to re-create the sinking. The film was co-financed by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; the former handled distribution in North America while the latter released the film internationally. It was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200 million. Filming took place from July 1996 to March 1997.\\nUpon its release on December 19, 1997, Titanic achieved significant critical and commercial success, and then received numerous accolades. It was praised for its visual effects, performances particularly DiCaprio, Winslet, and Stuart, production values, Camerons direction, musical score, cinematography, story, and emotional depth. Nominated for 14 Academy Awards, it tied All About Eve 1950 for the most Oscar nominations, and won 11, including the awards for Best Picture and Best Director, tying Ben-Hur 1959 for the most Oscars won by a single film. With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, Titanic was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark. It remained the highest-grossing film of all time until another Cameron film, Avatar, surpassed it in 2010. A 3D re-release version of Titanic, released on April 4, 2012, to commemorate the centennial of the sinking, earned it an additional $343.6 million worldwide, pushing the films worldwide total to $2.195 billion and making it the second film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide after Avatar. In 2017, the film was re-released for its 20th anniversary and was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being culturally, historically or aesthetically significant."

Key was inspired by the large U.S. flag, with 15 stars and 15 stripes, known as the Star-Spangled Banner, flying triumphantly above the fort during the U.S. victory.\\nThe poem was set to the tune of a popular British song written by John Stafford Smith for the Anacreontic Society, a mens social club in London. To Anacreon in Heaven or The Anacreontic Song, with various lyrics, was already popular in the United States. This setting, renamed The Star-Spangled Banner, soon became a well-known U.S. patriotic song. With a range of 19 semitones, it is known for being very difficult to sing. Although the poem has four stanzas, only the first is commonly sung today.\\nThe Star-Spangled Banner was first recognized for official use by the U.S. Navy in 1889. In 1931, the U.S. Congress passed a joint resolution 46 Stat. 1508 making the song the official national anthem of the United States, which President Herbert Hoover signed into law. The resolution is now codified at 36 U.S.C. 301a."

            "The Show Must Go On Queen song, The Show Must Go On is a song by British rock band Queen, featured as the twelfth and final track on their 1991 album, Innuendo. It is credited to Queen, but written mainly by Brian May. The song chronicles the effort of frontman Freddie Mercury continuing to perform despite approaching the end of his life, although his diagnosis with HIV/AIDS had not yet been made public in spite of ongoing media speculation claiming that he was seriously ill. When the band recorded the song in 1990, Mercurys condition had deteriorated to the point that May had concerns as to whether he was physically capable of singing it. May recalls; I said, Fred, I dont know if this is going to be possible to sing. And he went, Ill fucking do it, darlingvodka downand went in and killed it, completely lacerated that vocal.It was released as a single in the United Kingdom on 14 October 1991 in promotion for the Greatest Hits II album, just six weeks before Mercury died. Following Mercurys death on 24 November 1991, the song re-entered the British charts and spent as many weeks in the top 75 five as it did upon its original release, initially reaching a peak of 16. A live version with Elton John on vocals appeared on Queens Greatest Hits III album.The song was first played live on 20 April 1992, during The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, performed by the three remaining members of Queen, with Elton John singing lead vocals and Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi playing rhythm guitar. It has since been played live by Queen + Paul Rodgers and Queen + Adam Lambert with Rodgers citing one of the performances as the best of his career. Since its release, the song has appeared on television, film including an operatic version in Moulin Rouge!, and has been covered by a number of artists."

They are set on the fantasy world of Orb. The reader takes the part of a young monk/ninja, named Avenger, initially on a quest to avenge his foster fathers murder and recover stolen scrolls. Later books presented other challenges for Avenger to overcome, most notably taking over and ruling a city.\\nThe world of Orb was originally created by Mark Smith for a Dungeons and Dragons game he ran while a pupil at Brighton College in the mid-1970s. Orb was also used as the setting for the 1984 Fighting Fantasy gamebook Talisman of Death, and one of the settings in the 1985 Falcon gamebook Lost in Time, both by Smith and Thomson.\\nEach book has a disclaimer at the front against performing any of the ninja related feats in the book as They could lead to serious injury or death to an untrained user.\\nThe sixth book, Inferno!, ends on a cliffhanger with Avenger trapped in the web of the Black Widow, Orbs darkest blight. As no new books were released, the fate of Avenger and Orb was unknown. Mark Smith has confirmed that the cliffhanger ending was deliberate.In August 2013, the original creators of the series were working with Megara Entertainment to develop re-edited hardcover collector editions of the gamebooks including a new prequel Book 0 and sequel book 7, and potentially a role-playing game based on the series. The two new books plus the six re-edited original books were reprinted in paperback format by Megara Entertainment in 2014, and made available as PDFs in 2019."

Because the science fiction aspects of Never 7 had been positively received, Ever 17 was made with a larger focus on science fiction. The game has been positively received, with reviewers calling it one of the best in its genre, citing its story, characters, music, and graphics.\\nA remake, simply titled Ever 17, was developed by 5pb. and Cyberfront for Xbox 360 in 2011.

            "White demographic decline, White demographic decline is a decrease in the White populace as a percentage of the total population in a city, state, subregion, or nation. It has been recorded in a number of countries and smaller jurisdictions. For example, according to their national censuses, White Americans, White Canadians, White Latin Americans, and White people in the United Kingdom are in demographic decline in the United States, Canada, Latin America, and the United Kingdom, respectively.\\nScholars have attempted to address subfactors and anticipated results of White demographic decline in relevant societies. The term majority minority has been used to designate an area where a decline, of what are nationally defined as Whites, has resulted in a former majority becoming a minority. Examples of this include parts of the United States and Brazil. Other notable concepts include demographer Eric Kaufmanns theory of Whiteshift, which predicts transforming classifications of Whiteness as mixed-race majorities emerge, and social psychologist Jennifer Richesons research into racial shift conditions, which outline how White peoples hostility to other racial groups increases in proportion to their awareness of a drop in White population share.\\nExperts in extremism and terrorism have shown national demography in relation to white people to be subject to exploitation by both radical and political right-wing groups, including adherence to conspiracy theories. This has also manifested as anti-abortion, and anti-immigrant sentiment despite academic evidence that immigration significantly contributes to the maintenance of economies, civic institutions, and population-levels of places affected by White demographic decline, such as in the Southern United States."

The third Disney animated feature film, it consists of eight animated segments set to pieces of classical music conducted by Leopold Stokowski, seven of which are performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra. Music critic and composer Deems Taylor acts as the films Master of Ceremonies who introduces each segment in live action.\\nDisney settled on the films concept in 1938 as work neared completion on The Sorcerers Apprentice, originally an elaborate Silly Symphony cartoon designed as a comeback role for Mickey Mouse, who had declined in popularity. As production costs surpassed what the short could earn, Disney decided to include it in a feature-length film of multiple segments set to classical pieces with Stokowski and Taylor as collaborators. The soundtrack was recorded using multiple audio channels and reproduced with Fantasound, a pioneering sound system developed by Disney and RCA that made Fantasia the first commercial film shown in stereo and a precursor to surround sound.\\nFantasia was first released as a theatrical roadshow that was held in 13 cities across the U.S. between 1940 and 1941; the first began at the Broadway Theatre in New York City on November 13, 1940. While acclaimed by critics, it failed to make a profit owing to World War IIs cutting off distribution to the European market, the films high production costs, and the expense of building Fantasound equipment and leasing theatres for the roadshow presentations. Since 1942, the film has been reissued multiple times by RKO Radio Pictures and Buena Vista Distribution with its original footage and audio being deleted, modified, or restored in each version. When adjusted for inflation, Fantasia is the 23rd highest-grossing film of all time in the U.S.\\nThe Fantasia franchise has grown to include video games, Disneyland attractions, and a live concert series. A sequel, Fantasia 2000, co-produced by Walts nephew Roy E. Disney, was released in 1999. Fantasia has grown in reputation over the years and is now widely acclaimed as one of the greatest animated films of all time; in 1998, the American Film Institute ranked it as the 58th greatest American film in their 100 Years.100 Movies and the fifth greatest animated film in their 10 Top 10 list. In 1990, Fantasia was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."

            "Iron Age, The Iron Age is the final epoch of the three-age division of the prehistory and protohistory of humanity. It was preceded by the Stone Age Paleolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic and the Bronze Age Chalcolithic. The concept has been mostly applied to Iron Age Europe and the Ancient Near East, but also, by analogy, to other parts of the Old World.\\nThe duration of the Iron Age varies depending on the region under consideration. It is defined by archaeological convention. The Iron Age begins locally when the production of iron or steel has advanced to the point where iron tools and weapons replace their bronze equivalents in common use. In the Ancient Near East, this transition took place in the wake of the Bronze Age collapse, in the 12th century BC. The technology soon spread throughout the Mediterranean Basin region and to South Asia Iron Age in India between the 12th and 11th century BC. Its further spread to Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and Central Europe is somewhat delayed, and Northern Europe was not reached until around the start of the 5th century BC.\\nThe Iron Age is taken to end, also by convention, with the beginning of the historiographical record.\\nThis usually does not represent a clear break in the archaeological record; for the Ancient Near East, the establishment of the Achaemenid Empire c. 550 BC is traditionally and still usually taken as a cut-off date, later dates being considered historical by virtue of the record by Herodotus, despite considerable written records from far earlier well back into the Bronze Age now being known. In Central and Western Europe, the Roman conquests of the 1st century BC serve as marking for the end of the Iron Age. The Germanic Iron Age of Scandinavia is taken to end c. 800 AD, with the beginning of the Viking Age.\\nIn the Indian sub-continent, the Iron Age is taken to begin with the ironworking Painted Gray Ware culture. Recent estimates suggest that it ranges from the 15th century BC, through to the reign of Ashoka in the 3rd century BC. The use of the term Iron Age in the archaeology of South, East, and Southeast Asia is more recent and less common than for Western Eurasia. In China, written history started before iron-working arrived, so the term is infrequently used. The Sahel Sudan region and Sub-Saharan Africa are outside of the three-age system, there being no Bronze Age, but the term Iron Age is sometimes used in reference to early cultures practicing ironworking, such as the Nok culture of Nigeria."

It was released as his debut single on 13 September 2013, originally featuring on his extended play of the same name, before being featured as the opening track of his 2014 debut album Hozier. A struggling musician at the time of its composition, Hozier wrote and recorded the song in the attic of his parents home in County Wicklow. A mid-tempo soul song, its lyrics use religious terminology to describe a romantic relationship in the face of Church discrimination. The song caught the attention of Rubyworks Records, where producer Rob Kirwan collaborated with Hozier on the final recording.\\nThe accompanying music video premiered in September 2013, directed by Brendan Canty and Conal Thomson. It was shot in black-and-white and follows a romantic relationship between two men and its subsequent violent homophobic backlash. Upon its YouTube release in September 2013, the video quickly went viral, leading to Hoziers subsequent license with Columbia Records US and Island Records UK. In 2014, the song achieved widespread global popularity, topping the charts in 12 countries and reaching the top 10 in 21 other territories. The song also received critical acclaim.\\nAided by music platforms Shazam and Spotify to become a rock radio hit in the U.S., the song spent 23 consecutive weeks at the top of the Hot Rock Songs chart, tied with Imagine Dragons Radioactive as the longest-running number-one in its chart-history at the time. Take Me to Church later crossed over to the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at number two in December 2014. The song was nominated for the Grammy Award for Song of the Year at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards and has been certified six-times platinum in the US."

The battle system utilizes many of the unique features of the Nintendo DS, including combat that takes place on both screens, and attacks performed by certain motions on the touchscreen or by shouting into the microphone. Elements of Japanese youth culture, such as fashion, food, and cell phones, are key aspects of the missions and character progression.\\nThe World Ends with You received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the graphics, soundtrack, and integration of gameplay into the Shibuya setting.

It is a play on the phrase contempt of court, and is not an actual offense. The phrase is associated with unlawful arbitrary arrest and detention of individuals, often for expressing or exercising rights guaranteed to them by the United States Constitution. Contempt of cop is often discussed in connection to police misconduct such as use of excessive force or even police brutality as a reaction to perceived disrespectful behavior rather than for any legitimate law enforcement purpose.Arrests for contempt of cop may stem from a type of occupational arrogance when a police officer thinks his or her authority cannot or should not be challenged or questioned.\\nFrom such officers perspective, contempt of cop may involve perceived or actual challenges to their authority, including a lack of deference such as disobeying instructions, or expressing interest in filing a complaint against the officer. Fleeing from the police is sometimes considered a variant of contempt of cop. Contempt of cop situations may be exacerbated if other officers witness the allegedly contemptuous behavior.Charges such as disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and assaulting an officer may be cited as official reasons in a contempt of cop arrest. Obstruction of justice or failure to obey a police order is also cited in arrests in some jurisdictions, particularly as a stand-alone charge without any other charges brought."

            "Frank Butcher, Frank Butcher is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Mike Reid. Frank makes his first appearance on-screen as a guest character in 1987, but due to a positive viewer reception, he is reintroduced in 1988 as a regular. Reid took a long hiatus from EastEnders in 1994 and Frank remained off-screen for over a year and a half. Frank made his return as a recurring character from December 1995 to January 1998. Frank eventually becomes a regular once again from May 1998 to November 2000, when Reid quit the show. Frank makes three brief reappearances after that, the final one in December 2005. Given the widespread identification of Mike Reid as Frank, Reids death in July 2007 led to BBC bosses deciding that it would not be possible for the character to return in the future. In November 2007, it was announced that the character would die off-screen and in April 2008 his funeral was screened as part of a special set of episodes, dubbed Frank Week.\\nFrank is a wheeler-dealer who likes to think of himself as a big player in the business world, but in reality, he is little more than a wily conman. He is a smooth-talker and full of charm, but his actions are often thoughtless and he tends to run instead of facing up to his responsibilities, leaving his loved ones to pick up the pieces. His love affair with Pat Harris Pam St Clement stems back to his teens, and he can never quite let her go, always breaking her heart, disappearing, and returning to break it all over again."

Some media outlets, sporting experts, and human rights groups have criticised Qatars record of human rights violations; Qatars limited football history; the high expected cost; the local climate; and bribery in the bidding process. Not all nations competing have put focus on concerns.Criticism of human rights in Qatar focused on the treatment of migrant workers, women, and position on LGBT rights, leading to allegations of sportswashing. Others have cited Qatars intense climate and lack of a strong football culture, as well as evidence of bribery for hosting rights and wider FIFA corruption. Boycotts of the event were declared by several countries, clubs, and individual players, while former FIFA President Sepp Blatter has twice said that giving Qatar hosting rights was a mistake. Match attendance figures have also come under scrutiny as reported crowd attendances have exceeded stadium capacities despite games having visible empty seats.Incumbent FIFA President Gianni Infantino has defended the hosting of the tournament in Qatar. Others have suggested that Qatars human rights record is better than those of Russia and China, nations which received less widespread criticism for similar issues when hosting major sporting events in the years prior to the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The controversies surrounding the World Cup in Qatar have been described as a cultural conflict or Clash of Civilizations between authoritarian Islamic regimes and secular liberal democracies. Due to all these things this Qatari tournament is widely regarded as one of the most controversial world cup in history of FIFA World Cup."

The character was played by a number of infant actors until her departure in 1999. In 2005, Wright reprised her role as Chloe, while Ivy Latimer was cast as Olivia. Following Chloes death, Olivia was at the centre of a custody battle between her grandmother Diana Fraser Kerry McGuire and Chloes foster mother Irene Roberts Lynne McGranger.\\nThe character was reintroduced in 2015, with Banno cast in the role. During her audition, Banno performed scenes with actors Matt Little and Scott Lee, whose presence made her more excited about securing the role. Olivia is portrayed as bold, flirty, and confrontational. Banno also thought there was a darkness to Olivia. The characters early storylines focused on her friendship with VJ Patterson Little, a feud with villain Charlotte King Erika Heynatz, and the revelation that she has been self-harming due to being sexually abused. Banno praised the writers decision to explore the issue of self-harm, as she believed it was a topic that was not often portrayed on television.\\nProducers paired Olivia with Hunter King Lee, and their on-off relationship has been tested several times, with issues ranging from infidelity to pregnancy, and later a proposal.

The list of coincidences appeared in the mainstream American press in 1964, a year after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, having appeared prior to that in the GOP Congressional Committee Newsletter. In the 1970s, Martin Gardner examined the list in an article in Scientific American later reprinted in his 1985 book, The Magic Numbers of Dr. Matrix, pointing out that several of the claimed coincidences were based on misinformation. Gardners version of the list contained 16 items; many subsequent versions have circulated much longer lists. \\nA 1999 examination by Snopes found that the listed coincidences are easily explained as the simple product of mere chance. In 1992, the Skeptical Inquirer ran a Spooky Presidential Coincidences Contest. One winner found a series of sixteen similar coincidences between Kennedy and former Mexican President lvaro Obregn, while the other came up with similar lists for twenty-one pairs of U.S. presidents."

It may also be used facetiously, to suggest that formal education is not of practical value compared with street experience. \\nIn the UK, Australia and New Zealand, the phrases University of Life and School of Hard Knocks may be used interchangeably.In 1947, newspaperman James Franklin Comstock Jim Comstock founded the University of Hard Knocks, an honorary society with a mission to recognize people who have made a success of their life without the benefit of higher education.

The story follows a rebel pilot named Shinra as he battles an enemy nation using a specially designed fighter called the Ikaruga which can flip between two polarities, black and white. This polarity mechanism is the games key feature and the foundation for its stage and enemy design. All enemies and bullets in the game are either black or white. Bullets which are the same color as the player are absorbed while the others will kill the player. The game features both single-player and cooperative modes.\\nDevelopment on Ikaruga began during director Hiroshi Iuchis off-hours while Treasure was busy developing Sin and Punishment 2000. Titled Project RS2, the game began as a sequel to Radiant Silvergun, and borrows many elements from it as well as the polarity mechanism from Treasures Silhouette Mirage 1997. During the games prototype stages, the players ammo was limited. The bullet absorption mechanism was used as a means to refill ammo, however, this was found to be weak as it created too many breaks in the action. In tradition with Treasures game design philosophy, Ikaruga was intentionally crafted to challenge the conventions of standard game design and develop a new type of shooting game. All together, five Treasure staff worked on Ikaruga, as well as three support staff from G.rev.\\nUpon its initial release in Japanese arcades, reception was mixed. Treasure staff explained this was due to players expecting a more standard shooter offering but instead being greeted with a different game system that featured more puzzle-like elements rather than the twitch gameplay of bullet-dodging. In 2002, Ikaruga was ported to the Dreamcast in Japan and began to grow a cult following from import gamers worldwide. It was later released in the West in 2003 on the GameCube, receiving positive reviews. Critics praised the graphics as well as the art and sound design. Some criticism was directed towards its difficulty. Most critics felt the unique game design choices were innovative, while some believed they stifled many of the classic shooter elements. Ikaruga was later ported to the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4. In retrospect, Ikaruga is regarded by critics as one of the best shoot em ups of all time and one of Treasures greatest works."

He first appeared onscreen from 28 December 1998 and remained in the series until 1 March 2002. Introduced by series producer Matthew Robinson, the character Steve was a shady businessman who originally came into Albert Square to buy the local Market Cellar club which he then renovated and later renamed the E20. He soon became one of the shows primary villains when the characters first major storyline saw Steve murder his old flame Saskia Duncan Deborah Sheridan-Taylor during the opening night of his E20 nightclub on Valentines Day 1999, after which he ended up framing his DJ employee Matthew Rose Joe Absolom for the crime. The eventual episode in which Matthew enacted revenge on Steve drew in outstanding viewing figures and brought a storyline that had gripped the nation to a close.\\nAfterwards, Steve embarked on a dangerous feud with his arch nemesis: Phil Mitchell Steve McFadden. The ensuing conflict between them grew intensifying as Steve later became sworn enemies with Phils best-friend-turned-hardman adversary, Dan Sullivan Craig Fairbrass, which had continued to develop in the case of both Dan and Phil having respective connections to Steves girlfriend and future wife: Mel Healy Tamzin Outhwaite. Additionally, Steve contributed to his significant interaction with other members of the Mitchell family by establishing an antagonistic business partnership with Phils brother Grant Ross Kemp; sleeping with their younger sister Sam Kim Medcalf; employing the siblings cousin, Billy Perry Fenwick, to work for him as his errand boy; clashing with Phils adolescent godson Jamie Jack Ryder; and sparking a quarrel with the familys matriarch, Peggy Barbara Windsor, over his managing stake of her public house called The Queen Victoria.\\nIn 2001, the character was involved in the Who Shot Phil? storyline when he became a prime suspect. The whodunit scenario began with Steve marrying Mel on the day of Phils shooting and ultimately concluded with Dan kidnapping Mel for ransom against both Steve and Phil, after the pair had worked together to implicate Dan behind the shooting even though the culprit was earlier revealed to be Phils ex-girlfriend and Mels closest companion: Lisa Shaw Lucy Benjamin. Martin Kemp soon quit the series after his contract to the show had expired, and his final scenes were aired on 1 March 2002 the first anniversary of both Steves wedding and Phils shooting. In that episode, Steve made a last-ditch attempt to settle his score with Phil by fleeing the country and starting anew in America with his and Lisas infant daughter Louise which triggered a fierce car chase between the two archenemies that ended with Steve being killed after he crashed his car and consequently died in a vehicle explosion, though not before he helped Phil save Louise in his last moments; the characters funeral aired on 11 March 2002 and his onscreen wife Mel later departed a month later on 12 April that year in light of Steves death.\\nIt was thereafter alleged that producers had intentionally killed-off Steve as revenge for Martin Kemp leaving the show to make the transition from the BBC to rival station ITV. Nevertheless, Kemp received multiple award nominations and victories for his critically-acclaimed portrayal of Steve Owen."

As the story progresses, the player character learns he has been the victim of multiple deceptions, and must decide whether to proceed with his plan to revive the Devil or convert to the cause of good.\\nThe game is the first in the Deception series. It was a critical success, with reviewers particularly praising the originality of the games concept."

Prior games use either the real teams, the real players, or fictional substitutes, but not real teams and real players together.\\nThe game was a major success, resulting in several follow-ups for subsequent game consoles. The NES original has had an extensive cult following across the decades, with widely covered tournaments as the game modification community provides annual roster updates. It has been variously named as one of the best NES games, one of the best sports games, and one of the most influential video games of all time."

            "Age of Enlightenment, The Age of Enlightenment or the Enlightenment was an intellectual and philosophical movement that dominated Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries with global influences and effects. The Enlightenment included a range of ideas centered on the value of human happiness, the pursuit of knowledge obtained by means of reason and the evidence of the senses, and ideals such as liberty, progress, toleration, fraternity, and constitutional government.\\nThe Enlightenment was preceded by the Scientific Revolution and the work of Francis Bacon, John Locke, and others. Some date the beginning of the Enlightenment to the publication of Ren Descartes Discourse on the Method in 1637, featuring his famous dictum, Cogito, ergo sum I think, therefore I am. Others cite the publication of Isaac Newtons Principia Mathematica 1687 as the culmination of the Scientific Revolution and the beginning of the Enlightenment. European historians traditionally date its beginning with the death of Louis XIV of France in 1715 and its end with the 1789 outbreak of the French Revolution. Many historians now date the end of the Enlightenment as the start of the 19th century, with the latest proposed year being the death of Immanuel Kant in 1804.\\nPhilosophers and scientists of the period widely circulated their ideas through meetings at scientific academies, Masonic lodges, literary salons, coffeehouses and in printed books, journals, and pamphlets. The ideas of the Enlightenment undermined the authority of the monarchy and the Catholic Church and paved the way for the political revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries. A variety of 19th-century movements, including liberalism, communism, and neoclassicism, trace their intellectual heritage to the Enlightenment.The central doctrines of the Enlightenment were individual liberty and religious tolerance, in opposition to an absolute monarchy and the fixed dogmas of the Church. The principles of sociability and utility also played an important role in circulating knowledge useful to the improvement of society at large. The Enlightenment was marked by an increasing awareness of the relationship between the mind and the everyday media of the world, and by an emphasis on the scientific method and reductionism, along with increased questioning of religious orthodoxyan attitude captured by Immanuel Kants essay Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment, where the phrase Sapere aude Dare to know can be found."

The Wehrmacht as well as British and American militaries did not recognise the concept of an ace during the war. The similar term, tank ace has been used post-war to describe highly regarded tanks commanders.\\nThe term panzer ace has become prominent in contemporary popular culture as part of the uncritical portrayal of the Waffen-SS in English-language militaria and popular history works, especially in the United States. English translations of German author Franz Kurowskis use the term in his Panzer Aces series, which focuses on highly decorated tank commanders such as Michael Wittmann and Franz Bke.\\nIn the early 2000s, German historian Snke Neitzel and American military historian Steven Zaloga, amongst others, began to examine the combat performance of highly decorated German tank crews during the war. Zaloga argued that the term panzer ace is a romanticisation of reality mixed with propaganda, as it is neither possible to correctly determine tank kills in the heat of battle, or to separate individual performance from technological or battlefield advantage. In contrast, British historian Robert Kershaw argues that the large number of tanks destroyed by some German commanders can be attributed to the skills they gained through years of combat."

Many legends surround her ancestry; she was probably not a commoner and she married the ruler of the city, Odaenathus. Her husband became king in 260, elevating Palmyra to supreme power in the Near East by defeating the Sassanians and stabilizing the Roman East. After Odaenathus assassination, Zenobia became the regent of her son Vaballathus and held de facto power throughout his reign.\\nIn 270, Zenobia launched an invasion that brought most of the Roman East under her sway and culminated with the annexation of Egypt. By mid-271 her realm extended from Ancyra, central Anatolia, to southern Egypt, although she remained nominally subordinate to Rome. However, in reaction to the campaign of the Roman emperor Aurelian in 272, Zenobia declared her son emperor and assumed the title of empress declaring Palmyras secession from Rome. The Romans were victorious after heavy fighting; the queen was besieged in her capital and captured by Aurelian, who exiled her to Rome, where she spent the remainder of her life.\\nZenobia was a cultured monarch and fostered an intellectual environment in her court, which was open to scholars and philosophers. She was tolerant toward her subjects and protected religious minorities. The queen maintained a stable administration which governed a multicultural multiethnic empire. Zenobia died after 274, and many tales have been recorded about her fate. Her rise and fall have inspired historians, artists and novelists, and she is a patriotic symbol in Syria."

Jokes based on the events have been made in print and other media since soon after the attacks took place.\\nA number of scholars have studied the ways in which humor has been used to deal with the trauma of the event, including researcher Bill Ellis who found that jokes about the attacks began the day afterwards in the U.S., and Giselinde Kuipers, who found jokes on Dutch websites a day later. Kuipers had collected around 850 online jokes about 9/11, Osama bin Laden, and the Afghanistan war by 2005. A notable early public attempt at 9/11 humor was by Gilbert Gottfried just a few weeks after the attacks. During a comedy roast for Hugh Hefner at the Friars Club the crowd did not respond well to Gottfrieds 9/11 gag. One audience member at the club yelled out Too soon!, which has since become a common response to jokes told in the immediate wake of tragedies.In contrast to these early jokes about 9/11, late-night comedy shows and humorous publications did not appear for several weeks following the attacks. The Onion, a satirical newspaper, cancelled the issue that had been scheduled to be released on September 11, 2001, and then returned to print with a special edition on September 26, 2001, which was devoted to the attacks."

It uses laserdisc technology, offering greatly superior graphics compared to other video games at the time. The game was ported to several other platforms, but as no home system technology of that era could accommodate the graphical quality of LaserDisc, several abridged versions of the original game were released under different names. The first true sequel, Dragons Lair II: Time Warp, had started development as early as 1984, but would only appear in arcades in 1991. While its graphics were once again praised, its now outdated and limited interactivity compared to the newer generation of arcade games kept it from reaching the popularity of the original.The two main games in the series are considered gaming classics and are frequently re-released for each new generation of consoles. In 2010, they were bundled alongside the unrelated 1984 Bluth Group game Space Ace in the Dragons Lair Trilogy which was made available across numerous platforms.Forays into other media include a short lived animated series that aired on ABC in 1984 and a comic-book miniseries released in 2003. Plans for a feature-length film have existed since the 1980s and resurfaced in 2015, when Bluth launched two crowd-funding campaigns.

Its story centers on the revival of the Dragon King Onaga, who attempts to conquer the realms featured in the series after defeating the sorcerers Quan Chi and Shang Tsung, the main antagonists in the previous game, and the Thunder God Raiden, defender of Earthrealm. The surviving warriors from the previous titles join forces to confront Onaga.\\nTwenty-six characters are available to play in the game, with nine making their first appearance in the series. Deception contains several new features in the series, such as chess and puzzle games with the MK characters and an online mode. The Konquest Mode returns from Deadly Alliance, but follows the life of Shujinko, a warrior who is deceived by Onaga to search for artifacts to give Onaga more powers. Deceptions Konquest Mode differs greatly from the Konquest Mode of Deadly Alliance, however, containing elements of open-world exploration in between story progression, rather than the Kombat Tower of Deadly Alliance.\\nSeries co-creator Ed Boon designed Deception to be an unpredictable fighting game, and included new features such as the minigames as surprises. Several parts from Deadly Alliance such as combos and arenas were redesigned to be more realistic as well as more interactive. Deception has been well-received by video game reviewers, who praised the fights and the new features. The Konquest Mode, however, received criticism for poor voice acting. Several publications have called Deception the best fighting game of 2004."

The story of the games single player campaign focuses on a war in the 24th century between two factions, one human and the other alien, that is interrupted in its fourteenth year by the arrival of an enigmatic and militant alien race, whose genocidal advance forces the two sides into a ceasefire in order to work together to halt the threat.\\nDescent: FreeSpace was well-received as a single-player space simulation that integrated all the desired features of its genre, from competent AI wingmen, to the presence of large capital ships that dwarf the fighters piloted by the player and explode spectacularly when destroyed. The games multiplayer mode was criticised, as it was plagued by lag and inaccurate tracking of statistics. An expansion for the game, which was less well-received, was also released in 1998 under the title of Silent Threat, and focuses on events after the main games campaign with the player working for an intelligence branch of the Terrans armed forces that later attempt to overthrow the Terran government.

            "Carson Williams, Carson Williams is an electrical engineer from Mason, Ohio who is noted for his light shows using Christmas lights affixed to and around his house. The lights are programmed and synchronized to turn on and off with music using a computer application and set of controllers from the Light-O-Rama company. For each minute of animation synchronized to music, he spent approximately one hour to sequence 88 Light-O-Rama channels to control his 16,000 Christmas lights. His notability suddenly increased when a popular clip was widely circulated on the Internet in late 2005 showing a recording of one of his shows from 2004, accompanied by the track Wizards in Winter by the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. An urban legend even developed that it was not a video of an actual light display, but faked on a computer.\\nWith permission from both of his neighbors, he put on various displays each year at his home. Typical light shows ran between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. each night. Viewers heard the music on an FM broadcast in their cars. This kept the speaker noise level down for his neighbors.\\nHowever, on December 6, 2005, Carson closed the light display indefinitely due to immense traffic congestion in his subdivision; there was a car accident in that area and police were unable to reach the site due to the heavy traffic that had built up.Williamss Christmas display proved so popular that it was featured in a Miller Lite beer commercial in December 2005. In fact, the TSO song was so popular that many other individuals have used the same song in their own Christmas display. Subsequently, the Trans-Siberian Orchestra adopted a digitally-remastered version of the original as its own Official Video for Wizards in Winter, and posted it to YouTube on October 26, 2009.A light show similar to Williams Wizards in Winter was used in a commercial for the UKs National Lottery, although according to a press release the advertising campaign was created by Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO. No mention of Carson Williams light show was made.He has taken his Internet fame and started a custom animation lighting business. ConsarLights.com is a business to provide custom designed holiday lighting.\\nIn November 2006, Williams decided to revive the display and move the show to Heritage Oak Park in Mason, Ohio. The show was converted into a drive-through style show and admission was charged on a per-car basis.\\nAccording to a promotional video, officials at the Northfield Stapleton Shopping Center found Williams house lights video on the Internet and asked him to design a new show in Denver, Colorado, on a commercial scale. Created with Parker 3D, the show featured over 250,000 LED lights drawing 150 amperes of electric current. It used several Trans-Siberian Orchestra songs, including Wizards in Winter, Christmas Eve/Sarajevo 12/24 and Christmas Canon. Symphony In Lights was a free show open to the public that ran through the month of December 2006.\\nFor 2007, Consar Lights programmed new light shows designed by Parker 3D for The Promenade Bolingbrook in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, and the Yorkdale Shopping Centre in Toronto."

            "Thirteenth floor, The thirteenth floor is a designation of a level of a multi-level building that is often omitted in countries where the number 13 is considered unlucky. Omitting the 13th floor may take a variety of forms; the most common include denoting what would otherwise be considered the thirteenth floor as level 14, giving the thirteenth floor an alternate designation such as 12A or M the thirteenth letter of the Latin alphabet, or closing the 13th floor to public occupancy or access e.g., by designating it as a mechanical floor.\\nReasons for omitting a thirteenth floor include triskaidekaphobia on the part of the buildings owner or builder, or a desire by the building owner or landlord to prevent problems that may arise with superstitious tenants, occupants, or customers. In 2002, based on an internal review of records, Dilip Rangnekar of Otis Elevators estimated that 85% of the buildings with Otis brand elevators did not have a floor named the 13th floor. Early tall-building designers, fearing a fire on the 13th floor, or fearing tenants superstitions about the rumor, decided to omit having a 13th floor listed on their elevator numbering. This practice became commonplace, and eventually found its way into American mainstream culture and building design.Vancouver city planners have banned the practice of skipping 4s and 13s, since it could lead to mistakes by first responders, for example going to the wrong floor."

Though notable for its convoluted narrative and constant digressions, the story largely centers on a non-canonical female vampire character named Ebony Darkness Dementia Raven Way and her relationships with the characters of the Harry Potter series, particularly her romantic relationship with Draco Malfoy, culminating in her travelling back in time to defeat the main antagonist of the series, Lord Voldemort or Vlodemort.\\nMy Immortal is popularly regarded as one of the worst works of fan fiction ever written. Since the works publication, it has gained infamy for its constant grammar and spelling errors, plot inconsistencies and complete disregard for the original Harry Potter source material. Despite this, the series has also inspired multiple derivative works, including a YouTube web series, and is viewed with nostalgia for adolescent fan life.\\nThe authors identity has never been confirmed and has been deemed as unsolvable. The author published the story under the username XXXbloodyrists666XXX and self-identified as Tara Gilesbie. In September 2017, someone claiming to be the author updated a FictionPress account stating that she had created an active Tumblr account under her real name; an effort to locate this Tumblr account resulted in the account of young adult novelist Rose Christo. She has since stated that she was one of two co-authors of My Immortal and had provided evidence of her authorship to Macmillan Publishers, but controversy that same month over factual errors in her then-forthcoming memoirs has led to doubt as to her authorship.\\nThe story has been speculated to be a hoax designed to fool and troll readers or to satirize fan fiction, but others consider the work and the alleged online presence of the author too elaborate to fake effectively. In September 2017, Christo stated that My Immortal is a work of satire, though her authorship is disputed."

            "Lion, The lion Panthera leo is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lions pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically dont actively seek out and prey on humans.\\nThe lion inhabits grasslands, savannas and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.\\nOne of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century. Cultural depictions of lions were prominent in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures in the lions historic and current range."

In 1980, Elliot won the Daytime Emmy for outstanding supporting actress and was nominated again in 1993. Briefly in 1989, while Jane Elliot was on maternal leave, Christine Jones took on the role.

She has two sons, Ned Quartermaine also known as Ned Ashton and Dillon Quartermaine; two stepsons, Lucky Spencer and Ethan Lovett; and a stepdaughter, Lulu Spencer. Many of her storylines over the course of 30 years involved feuds with her sister-in-law, Dr. Monica Quartermaine, Tracys unsuccessful attempts to find love, her determination to gain power in ELQ, the family company, and her attempts to one-up family members who have tried to displace her or her sons in ELQ or in her fathers affections.\\nTracy was originally presented as a vivacious socialite who hid her scheming nature, but her brother and parents saw through that and warned her sister-in-law Monica. Although friendly on the outside, Tracy could be snobbish on a whim, although that became more apparent when she was older rather than during her early days in Port Charles. While Tracy wanted to get in good with her father, Edward, he still deemed his son Alan Quartermaine, Tracys brother, his favorite. In recent years, Tracy has greatly mellowed, showing her maternal side with her sons Ned and Dillon, as well as stepdaughter Lulu, supporting her sister-in-law Monica through various ordeals, and befriending female characters after never really having had women friendships while younger."

Very little material and textual evidence survives from this period. The earliest archaeological evidence at Assur dates to the Early Dynastic Period, c. 2600 BC, but the city may have been founded even earlier since the area had been inhabited for thousands of years prior and other nearby cities, such as Nineveh, are significantly older.\\nThe archaeological evidence suggests that Assur was originally inhabited by Hurrians and was the site of a fertility cult devoted to the goddess Ishtar. The name Assur is not historically attested prior to the age of the Akkadian Empire in the 24th century BC; it is possible that the city was originally named Baltil, used in later times to refer to its oldest portion. At some point before the rise of the Akkadian Empire, the Semitic-speaking ancestors of the later Assyrians settled in Assur and the surrounding area, either displacing or assimilating the original population. Founded in a both holy and strategic location, the city itself was gradually deified during the Early Assyrian period and eventually became personified as the god Ashur, firmly established as the Assyrian national deity by the time of Puzur-Ashur I.\\nThere is no evidence that Assur was independent at any point in the Early Assyrian period. Throughout the centuries prior to Puzur-Ashur I, it is instead evident that the city was dominated by a sequence of powerful states and empires from southern Mesopotamia. In the Early Dynastic Period, Assur experienced considerable Sumerian influence, and for a time fell under the hegemony of the Sumerian city of Kish. In the 24th to 22nd centuries BC, the city was part of the Akkadian Empire as an administrative outpost in northern Mesopotamia, a time later Assyrian kings saw as a golden age. In the final geopolitical stage preceding Assurs independence, the city became a peripheral city within the Sumerian empire of the Third Dynasty of Ur c. 21122004 BC."

The series centers on Rolfes titular skit character, often simply shortened to the Nerd sometimes just Nerd, a short-tempered and foul-mouthed gamer who delivers commentary on retro games of poor quality. While the series began with Rolfe simply playing games while delivering retrospective commentary, the show would eventually grow in scope to encompass sketches featuring guest characters, reviews of gaming consoles and peripherals, and short lectures about video game history and culture.Starting out as an independent filmmaker, Rolfe intended his earliest videos of the character originally called The Angry Nintendo Nerd to be a joke privately shown amongst friends and colleagues. In 2004, Rolfe, at the suggestion of future series producer Mike Matei, put the Angry Nintendo Nerd videos on his website, and in 2006 on the emerging video streaming platform YouTube, where it gained popularity. The series became a cult success, and Rolfe began appearing as the character in various other media such as a feature-length film and video games, and many public appearances. The series was soon renamed to The Angry Video Game Nerd to avoid trademark issues with Nintendo, and to allow Rolfe to review games from non-Nintendo consoles. From 2007 to 2011, the series entered a distribution deal with popular gaming websites ScrewAttack and GameTrailers, and briefly with streaming service Amazon Video in 2018.\\nThe Angry Video Game Nerd is considered one of the pioneers of internet review videos, being highly influential on the style and format of subsequent video reviewers as well as being responsible for helping to bring the concept into the mainstream. Various media review/sketch comedy entertainers have since cited the show as inspiration for their own material, such as JonTron, Nostalgia Critic, Egoraptor, Angry Joe, and Joueur du Grenier among others."

It is considered to be the spiritual successor to Slap Fight. Based around a video game within a video game concept, players assume the role of a young secret agent assigned by the government taking control of the NA-00 space fighter craft in an attempt to defeat the titular virtual reality simulator, rescue the abducted players who lost against it and unveil its true purpose.\\nHeaded by DonPachi producer Kenichi Takano, Grind Stormer was created by a small development team of new employees at Toaplan who would later go on to work at one of its offshoots after the company declared bankruptcy in 1994 and was originally titled Bakuretsu Wing before being ultimately renamed to VV in Japan. It is notable for marking the debut of Cave co-founder Tsuneki Ikeda in the video game industry, serving as one of its programmers and features a much smaller hitbox for the ship compared with previous shoot em up games released at the time. It is also notable for being one of the last games by Toaplan to feature an FM soundtrack, as the company began to clear out their FM chip inventory. Initially launched for the arcades, the game was later ported to the Sega Genesis by Tengen and first published in Japan on 25 March 1994 and a month later in North America, featuring both the original Japanese and North American versions as selectable gameplay modes.\\nGrind Stormer proved to be popular in arcades but the game has been met with mixed reception from critics and reviewers alike since its release on the Genesis, who felt divided in regards to several aspects such as the presentation, visuals, sound design and gameplay. It has been regarded by some to be an early example of a manic shooter. As of 2019, its rights are owned by Tatsujin, a company founded in 2017 by former Toaplan member Masahiro Yuge and now-affiliate of Japanese arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia alongside many other Toaplan IPs."

As of 2015, it was estimated that the game had sold 275 million copies worldwide.Monopoly is derived from The Landlords Game, created by Lizzie Magie in the United States in 1903 as a way to demonstrate that an economy that rewards individuals is better than one where monopolies hold all the wealth and to promote the economic theories of Henry Georgein particular, his ideas about taxation. The Landlords Game originally had two sets of rules, one with tax and another on which the current rules are mainly based. When Parker Brothers first published Monopoly in 1935, the game did not include the less capitalistic taxation rule, resulting in a more aggressive game. Parker Brothers were eventually absorbed into Hasbro in 1991. The game is named after the economic concept of a monopolythe domination of a market by a single entity."

            "Neolithic Revolution, The Neolithic Revolution, or the First Agricultural Revolution, was the wide-scale transition of many human cultures during the Neolithic period from a lifestyle of hunting and gathering to one of agriculture and settlement, making an increasingly large population possible. These settled communities permitted humans to observe and experiment with plants, learning how they grew and developed. This new knowledge led to the domestication of plants into crops.Archaeological data indicates that the domestication of various types of plants and animals happened in separate locations worldwide, starting in the geological epoch of the Holocene 11,700 years ago. It was the worlds first historically verifiable revolution in agriculture. The Neolithic Revolution greatly narrowed the diversity of foods available, resulting in a downturn in the quality of human nutrition compared with that obtained previously from foraging.The Neolithic Revolution involved far more than the adoption of a limited set of food-producing techniques. During the next millennia it transformed the small and mobile groups of hunter-gatherers that had hitherto dominated human pre-history into sedentary non-nomadic societies based in built-up villages and towns. These societies radically modified their natural environment by means of specialized food-crop cultivation, with activities such as irrigation and deforestation which allowed the production of surplus food. Other developments that are found very widely during this era are the domestication of animals, pottery, polished stone tools, and rectangular houses. In many regions, the adoption of agriculture by prehistoric societies caused episodes of rapid population growth, a phenomenon known as the Neolithic demographic transition.\\nThese developments, sometimes called the Neolithic package, provided the basis for centralized administrations and political structures, hierarchical ideologies, depersonalized systems of knowledge e.g. writing, densely populated settlements, specialization and division of labour, more trade, the development of non-portable art and architecture, and greater property ownership. The earliest known civilization developed in Sumer in southern Mesopotamia c. 6,500 BP; its emergence also heralded the beginning of the Bronze Age.The relationship of the aforementioned Neolithic characteristics to the onset of agriculture, their sequence of emergence, and empirical relation to each other at various Neolithic sites remains the subject of academic debate, and varies from place to place, rather than being the outcome of universal laws of social evolution. The Levant saw the earliest developments of the Neolithic Revolution from around 10,000 BC, followed by sites in the wider Fertile Crescent."

It refers to an individual, perhaps talented and capable, who does not fit into social norms. In most cases, this person is born into wealth and privilege. Typical characteristics are disregard for social values, cynicism, and existential boredom; typical behaviors are gambling, drinking, romantic intrigues and duels. He is often unmindful, indifferent or unempathetic with societys issues and can carelessly distress others with his actions, despite his position of power. He will often use his power for his own comfort and security and will have very little interest in being charitable or using it for the greater good. \\nThe superfluous man will often attempt to manipulate, control or enslave other individuals. Because he has no integrity or ambitions, he is often self-serving and sees little point to being a benefactor or helping others. He will often carelessly try to manipulate, degrade or pacify individuals within the society; in order to gain more comfort and security.\\nThe character type originates in Alexander Pushkins verse-novel Eugene Onegin 18251832.

Mikhail Lermontovs A Hero of Our Time 1840 depicts another superfluous man Pechorin as its protagonist. He can be seen as a nihilist and fatalist. Later examples include Alexander Herzens Beltov in Who Is to Blame? 184546, Turgenevs Rudin 1856, and the title character of Ivan Goncharovs Oblomov 1859.Russian critics such as Vissarion Belinsky 1811-1848 viewed the superfluous man as a byproduct of Nicholas Is reign, when the best-educated men would not enter the discredited government service but, lacking other options for self-realization, doomed themselves to live out their life in passivity. The radical critic Nikolay Dobrolyubov 1836-1861 analyzed the superfluous man as by-product of Russian serfdom. Scholar David Patterson describes the superfluous man as not just . another literary type but . a paradigm of a person who has lost a point, a place, a presence in life before concluding that the superfluous man is a homeless man.The superfluous man is often in contrast politically with the great man."

Players control the Solvalou starship in its mission to destroy a rogue supercomputer named GAMP and the Xevian Forces, using two basic weapon types - an air zapper to destroy air targets, and a blaster bomb to destroy ground targets. The game also features destructive power-ups, new bosses, and two player simultaneous play.\\nWith the shootem up genre seeing a sudden revival in the mid-1990s, with titles like RayStorm and G-Darius performing well, Namco sought to capitalize on its success with a modernized 3D update to Xevious. Being one of the first games for its System 11 hardware, it featured a heavy emphasis on its techno-infused soundtrack, most of which was composed jointly by Ayako Saso and Shinji Hosoe. The hardware allowed the game to have a world much closer to the one established in previous games, with settings such as large, Aztec-inspired structures and deserts being pulled from pieces of conceptual artwork for the original.\\nXevious 3D/G received heavy criticism from fans for what they felt were drastic departures that interrupted the core mechanics, and that it strayed too far from what they felt made the game so popular in its heyday. A PlayStation conversion, titled Xevious 3D/G+, was released a year later that compiled 3D/G with the original Xevious, Super Xevious, and Xevious Arrangement onto one disc.

In some interviews the lead designer of the game compares Stalin vs. Martians to the Troma films.In July, following the games release, it became no longer available to be purchased, for unknown reasons. The official website claimed that an upgraded version of Stalin vs. Martians would soon be released, but the game was never made available again, neither in original or upgraded version.This game uses the same updated version of the Enigma Engine as Blitzkrieg 2."

            "Devon Hamilton, Devon Hamilton is a fictional character from The Young and the Restless, an American soap opera on the CBS network, portrayed by Bryton James. The character made his first appearance on June 1, 2004, and was introduced as a homeless teenager who is taken in by the Winters family, the core African-American family within the series. Drucilla Winters Victoria Rowell sympathizes with Devon because she too was a product of the foster care system. Drucilla and her husband Neil Kristoff St. John raise Devon along with their daughter Lily Christel Khalil and legally adopt him in 2006.\\nUnlike most young male characters whose stories typically centered around romance and teen angst, the character of Devon became a vehicle for social and human interest stories, focusing on the challenges of having a drug addict for a parent, being a product of the foster care system, and deafness. While Devon has a consistent love interest, the romance was rarely displayed and severely undeveloped. In 2009, the character was involved in a controversial storyline in which he had an affair with Tyra Hamilton Eva Marcille, a woman hed come to know as his aunt, though it was later revealed that they are not related. The foster care, meningitis and deaf story arcs received critical acclaim for their social impact and earned James five Daytime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series and James won the award in 2007. James also earned seven NAACP Image Award nominations for Outstanding Actor in a Daytime Drama Series and he won the award in 2009.\\nIn 2011, the character would be written into more traditional soap opera plots starting with the revelation that he is the long lost grandson of the wealthy Katherine Chancellor Jeanne Cooper. However, the plot twist would only bring him closer to his adoptive father, Neil. In 2013, Devon inherits the bulk of Katherines billion dollar estate which turns his life upside. In 2014, Devon enters into an affair with Neils young wife Hilary Curtis Mishael Morgan. Devons forbidden love affair with Hilary would mark the characters first major love story and would also solidify the character as a viable romantic lead. Due to the chemistry between the characters, the pairing of Devon and Hilary quickly amassed a very active fan base and as well as critical acclaim which propelled them to supercouple status. James earned two Daytime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2016 and 2019; he won the award in 2020."

The Metal Hawk can change its altitude to allow it to either rise higher in the air or lower towards the ground. It ran on the Namco System 2 arcade board.\\nMetal Hawk was one of the first games to be developed under Namcos then-new research and development R&D video game division in Japan. The development staff focused on creating a game that was both fun to play and exhilarating, and one with powerful, impressive hardware capabilities, specifically in its motion simulator arcade cabinet. Shinji Hosoe composed the games soundtrack with assistance from Kazuo Noguchi; early versions had additional sound and instrument channels with a more upbeat vibe; these channels had to be removed later on due to a lack of hardware space. Japanese voice actress Maya Okamoto served as the voice of the operator, which provides commentary during levels.\\nMetal Hawk was produced in limited quantities due to production costs regarding the cabinet; despite this, it proved to be a commercial success, and remained one of the most popular arcade games at the time. Critics commended the game for its fast-paced gameplay, impressive graphics and immersive arcade cabinet, with one critic labeling it was Namcos next blockbuster video game. Several have also compared the game heavily to Segas Thunder Blade, with many finding Metal Hawk to be superior. A home port of the game for the Sega CD was rumored to be in development but later cancelled."

The movement reflected a desire for the creation of new forms of art, philosophy, and social organization which reflected the newly emerging industrial world, including features such as urbanization, architecture, new technologies, and war. Artists attempted to depart from traditional forms of art, which they considered outdated or obsolete. The poet Ezra Pounds 1934 injunction to Make it New was the touchstone of the movements approach.\\nModernist innovations included abstract art, the stream-of-consciousness novel, montage cinema, atonal and twelve-tone music, divisionist painting and modern architecture. Modernism explicitly rejected the ideology of realism and made use of the works of the past by the employment of reprise, incorporation, rewriting, recapitulation, revision and parody. Modernism also rejected the certainty of Enlightenment thinking, and many modernists also rejected religious belief. A notable characteristic of modernism is self-consciousness concerning artistic and social traditions, which often led to experimentation with form, along with the use of techniques that drew attention to the processes and materials used in creating works of art.While some scholars see modernism continuing into the 21st century, others see it evolving into late modernism or high modernism. Postmodernism is a departure from modernism and rejects its basic assumptions.\\n\\n"

Later work by Robert Alter employed similar examination to parts of the Hebrew Bible, in particular to the betrothal type-scene at the well in Genesis.:45 Another type scene that Alter identifies is the annunciation of the birth of the hero to a barren woman, such as the birth of Samson to Manoahs wife, or the birth of Samuel to Hannah.

They traverse side-scrolling stages while avoiding hazards such as enemies and pits with the aid of power-ups such as the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, and Starman.\\nThe game was designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka as a grand culmination of the Famicom teams three years of game mechanics and programming, drawing from their experiences working on Devil World and the side-scrollers Excitebike and Kung Fu to advance their previous work on platforming athletic games such as Donkey Kong and Mario Bros. The design of the first level, World 1-1, serves as a tutorial for platform gameplay.\\nSuper Mario Bros. is frequently cited as one of the greatest video games of all time, with praise for its precise controls.

It is credited alongside the NES as one of the key factors in reviving the video game industry after the 1983 crash, and helped popularize the side-scrolling platform game genre. Koji Kondos soundtrack is one of the earliest and most popular in video games, making music a centerpiece of game design. The game began a multimedia franchise including a long-running game series, an animated television series, an animated feature film, a live-action feature film and another upcoming animated feature film.

The double bubble theorem was formulated and thought to be true in the 19th century, and became a serious focus of research by 1989, but was not proven until 2002.\\nThe proof combines multiple ingredients. Compactness of rectifiable currents a generalized definition of surfaces shows that a solution exists. A symmetry argument proves that the solution must be a surface of revolution, and it can be further restricted to having a bounded number of smooth pieces. Jean Taylors proof of Plateaus laws describes how these pieces must be shaped and connected to each other, and a final case analysis shows that, among surfaces of revolution connected in this way, only the standard double bubble has locally-minimal area.\\nThe double bubble theorem extends the isoperimetric inequality, according to which the minimum-perimeter enclosure of any area is a circle, and the minimum-surface-area enclosure of any single volume is a sphere. Analogous results on the optimal enclosure of two volumes generalize to weighted forms of surface energy, to Gaussian measure of surfaces, and to Euclidean spaces of any dimension."

However, the console versions received lower ratings. In its first year of release it sold over 200,000 copies, accounting to $8.86 million in revenue.

It was the first game in the series to be released on CD-ROM, allowing for a full musical score, fully animated cutscenes, and the introduction of voice acting for the characters. Dominic Armato, Alexandra Boyd, and Earl Boen respectively voiced Guybrush, Elaine, and LeChuck, and would reprise these roles in later installments.\\nThe game sold well, particularly in Germany; lead background artist Bill Tiller estimated that it sold half a million units worldwide over the next several years.

Some blocks contain power-ups that have various effects, such as increasing the length of the Vaus, creating several additional balls, or turning the Vaus into a laser cannon. Other blocks may be indestructible or require multiple hits to break.\\nCreated by Taito designers Akira Fujita and Hiroshi Tsujino, Arkanoid expanded on the concept established in Ataris Breakout, a successful game in its own right that was met with a large wave of similar clone games from other manufacturers. It was part of a contest within Taito, where two teams of designers had to complete a block breaker game and determine which one was superior to the other. The film Tron served as inspiration for the games futuristic, neon aesthetic. Level designs were sketched on paper before being programmed and tested to make sure they were fun to play. The enemy and power-up designs were 3D models converted into sprite art.\\nEarly location tests for Arkanoid surpassed Taitos initial expectations. It became a major commercial success in arcades, becoming the highest-grossing table arcade cabinet of 1987 in Japan and the years highest-grossing conversion kit in the United States. The game was commended by critics for its gameplay, simplicity, addictive nature, and improvements over the original Breakout concept. The game revitalized the genre and set the groundwork for many games to follow. Arkanoid was ported to many home video game platforms, including the Commodore 64, Nintendo Entertainment System, ZX Spectrum, and years later mobile phones, and it spawned a long series of sequels and updates over the course of two decades."

            "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an American media franchise created by the comic book artists Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. It follows Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello and Raphael, four anthropomorphic turtle brothers named after Italian Renaissance artists trained in ninjutsu who fight evil in New York City. Supporting characters include the turtles rat sensei Splinter, their human friends April ONeil and Casey Jones, and enemies such as Baxter Stockman, Krang, and their archenemy, the Shredder.\\nThe franchise began as a comic book, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which Eastman and Laird conceived as a parody of elements popular in superhero comics at the time. The first issue was published in 1984 by Eastman and Lairds company Mirage Studios and was a surprise success. In 1987, Eastman and Laird licensed the characters to Playmates Toys, which developed a line of Turtles action figures. About US$1.1 billion of Turtles toys were sold between 1988 and 1992, making them the third-bestselling toy figures ever at the time.\\nThe action figures were promoted with an animated series, which premiered in 1987 and ran for almost a decade. In some European regions, the franchise was called Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles due to the violent connotations of the word ninja. Three live-action films were released; the first, released in 1990, became the highest-grossing independent film up to that point. Numerous video games have also been released. In 2009, the franchise was purchased by Viacom, now Paramount Global. Viacom commissioned a new comic series, two new live-action films, and new animated series."

He is the first tokusatsu hero launched by the Ultra Series and by extension, Tsuburaya Productions. His appearance in the entertainment world helped spawn the Kyodai Hero genre with countless shows such as Godman and Iron King.\\nUltraman first appeared as the title character alongside his human host Shin Hayata in the 1966 Japanese television series, Ultraman which ran for 39 episodes. Following Ultramans success, Tsuburaya created another Kyodai hero series still as part of their Ultra Series project, Ultraseven. While both series shared the same genre with very similar heroes, there was originally no relationship between the two. It was not until The Return of Ultraman was created four years later in 1971 that both Ultraman and Ultra Seven came together into the same story. This event cemented Tsuburaya Productions decision to have the Ultra Series continue to follow the trend of focusing on an Ultraman with each new entry. The original red-and-silver giant hero himself enjoyed a long series of popularity and has continued to appear in various works in the Ultra Series. Apart from that, he also has a lot of popularity trademarks that make him memorable to this day: his Color Timer, the Specium Ray stance, and his famous cry Shuwatch , Shuwatchi.\\nIn the series, Ultramans grunts and his iconic shout Shuwatch were provided by Masao Nakasone , Nakasone Masao, who would later voice him as an actual character in episode 33 during his fight with Alien Mefilas. His dialogue in episodes 1 and 39 was provided by Hisashi Kond , Kond Hisashi while in episode 15, he was voiced by Koji Ishizaka , Ishizaka Kji, the narrator of episodes 1 to 19. In subsequent appearances, Ultraman reuses Masaos grunt while his voice being provided by Susumu Kurobe Shin Hayatas actor or just simply being speechless during the screen time. Ultramans suit actor was Bin Furuya , Furuya Bin during the original season. He would later go on to portray Ultra Guard member Amagi, one of the characters in the later series, Ultra Seven. Ultraman appeared in later works of the Ultra Series played by various voice and suit actors. Although Susumu Kurobe did reprise his role as Hayata or provided the voice of Ultraman himself at times though his grunts were still reused from the late Masao Nakasone but there are other occasions where he was voiced by other voice actors.\\nIn Japan, The Ultraman brand generated $7.4 billion in merchandising revenue from 1966 to 1987, equivalent to more than $18 billion adjusted for inflation. Ultraman was the worlds third top-selling licensed character in the 1980s, largely due to his popularity in Asia."

Stapleton left the role and Mandy departed on-screen on 13 January 1994.\\nFollowing Mandys initial exit, Stapleton claimed that she was asked to reprise the role on several occasions; she turned these offers down until producer Bryan Kirkwood negotiated her comeback in 2011. After a 17-year hiatus, Mandy reappeared from 29 August 2011 and began a relationship with the long-running character, Ian Beale played by Adam Woodyatt. Mandys return storylines focused on her dysfunctional relationship with her mother Lorraine Victoria Alcock, her unconventional engagement to Ian, and her fuelling conflict with Ians daughter Lucy Hetti Bywater. On 4 April 2012, it was announced that Stapleton would be leaving EastEnders for a second time. Mandy and Ian were not given a happy ending; their relationship dissolved and Mandy departed in the episode broadcast on 31 May 2012."

            "Euhemerism, Euhemerism is an approach to the interpretation of mythology in which mythological accounts are presumed to have originated from real historical events or personages. Euhemerism supposes that historical accounts become myths as they are exaggerated in the retelling, accumulating elaborations and alterations that reflect cultural mores. It was named for the Greek mythographer Euhemerus, who lived in the late 4th century BC. In the more recent literature of myth, such as Bulfinchs Mythology, euhemerism is termed the historical theory of mythology.Euhemerus was not the first to attempt to rationalize mythology in historical terms: euhemeristic views are found in earlier writings including those of Sanchuniathon, Xenophanes, Herodotus, Hecataeus of Abdera and Ephorus. However, the enduring influence of Euhemerus upon later thinkers such as the classical poet Ennius b. 239 BC and modern author Antoine Banier b. 1673 AD identified him as the traditional founder of this school of thought."

The excluded games are Commando, Double Dragon, Ghostbusters, Ghostbusters II, Kung Fu Master, and Rampage, although Capcom did give Activision rights to put Commando in the PlayStation 2, Windows, and Mac OS X versions of Activision Anthology. Ghostbusters II was cancelled before Activision could release it, but Salu released it in Europe under their name in 1992. The Absolute Entertainment title Pete Rose Baseball was renamed Baseball."

It was expanded upon in 1977 by Don Woods. In the game, the player explores a cave system rumored to be filled with treasure and gold. The game is composed of dozens of locations, and the player moves between these locations and interacts with objects in them by typing one- or two-word commands which are interpreted by the games natural language input system. The program acts as a narrator, describing the players location and the results of the players attempted actions. It is the first well-known example of interactive fiction, as well as the first well-known adventure game, for which it was also the namesake.\\nThe original game, written in 1975 and 1976, was based on Crowthers maps and experiences caving in Mammoth Cave in Kentucky, the longest cave system in the world; further, it was intended, in part, to be accessible to non-technical players, such as his two daughters. Woods version expanded the game in size and increased the number of fantasy elements present in it, such as a dragon and magic spells. Both versions, typically played over teleprinters connected to mainframe computers, were spread around the nascent ARPANET, the precursor to the Internet, which Crowther was involved in developing.\\nColossal Cave Adventure was one of the first teletype games and was massively popular in the computer community of the late 1970s, with numerous ports and modified versions being created based on Woods source code. It directly inspired the creation of numerous games, including Zork 1977, Adventureland 1978, Mystery House 1980, Rogue 1980, and Adventure 1980, which went on to be the foundations of the interactive fiction, adventure, roguelike, and action-adventure genres. It also influenced the creation of the MUD and computer role-playing game genres. It has been noted as one of the most influential video games, and in 2019 was inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame by The Strong and the International Center for the History of Electronic Games."

            "African humid period",
            "African humid period, The African humid period AHP also known by other names is a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today. The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in Earths orbit around the Sun; changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon; and increased greenhouse gases.\\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, but its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,60014,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the BllingAllerd warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,0005,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the period appears to have taken place in several steps such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Deserts, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies."

            "Novelty song, A novelty song is a type of song built upon some form of novel concept, such as a gimmick, a piece of humor, or a sample of popular culture. Novelty songs partially overlap with comedy songs, which are more explicitly based on humor, and with musical parody, especially when the novel gimmick is another popular song. Novelty songs achieved great popularity during the 1920s and 1930s. They had a resurgence of interest in the 1950s and 1960s. The term arose in Tin Pan Alley to describe one of the major divisions of popular music; the other two divisions were ballads and dance music. Humorous songs, or those containing humorous elements, are not necessarily novelty songs.\\nNovelty songs are often a parody or humor song, and may apply to a current event such as a holiday or a fad such as a dance or TV programme. Many use unusual lyrics, subjects, sounds, or instrumentation, and may not even be musical. For example, the 1966 novelty song Theyre Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!, by Napoleon XIV, has little music and is set to a rhythm tapped out on a snare drum, a tambourine, and the bare sides of the musicians legs.\\nA book on achieving an attention-grabbing novelty single is The Manual How to Have a Number One the Easy Way, written by The KLF. It is based on their achievement of a UK number-one single with Doctorin the Tardis, a 1988 dance remix mashup of the Doctor Who theme music released under the name of The Timelords. It argued that at the time achieving a number one single could be achieved less by musical talent than through market research, sampling and gimmicks matched to an underlying danceable groove."

            "Lenin was a mushroom, Lenin was a mushroom Russian:  was a highly influential televised hoax by Soviet musician Sergey Kuryokhin and reporter Sergey Sholokhov. It was first broadcast on 17 January 1991 on Leningrad Television.The hoax took the form of an interview on the television program Pyatoe Koleso The Fifth Wheel. In the interview, Kuryokhin, impersonating a historian, narrated his findings that Vladimir Lenin consumed large quantities of psychedelic mushrooms and eventually became a mushroom himself. Kuryokhin arrived at his conclusion through a long series of logical fallacies and appeals to the authority of various sources such as Carlos Castaneda, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, creating the illusion of a reasoned and plausible logical chain.\\nThe timing of the hoax played a large role in its success, coming as it did during the glasnost period when the ebbing of censorship in the Soviet Union led to many revelations about the countrys history, often presented in sensational form. Furthermore, Soviet television had, up to that point, been regarded by its audience as conservative in style and content. As a result, a large number of Soviet citizens one estimate puts the number at 11.3 million audience members took the deadpan interview at face value, in spite of the absurd claims presented.\\nSholokhov has said that perhaps the most notable result of the show was an appeal by a group of party members to the Leningrad Regional Committee of the CPSU to clarify the veracity of Kuryokhins claim. According to Sholokhov, in response to the request one of the top regional functionaries stated that Lenin could not have been a mushroom because a mammal cannot be a plant. Modern taxonomy classifies mushrooms as fungi, a separate kingdom from plants."

Created by Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle, the character debuted in the pilot Crush, which premiered on June 7, 2002. After starring in each of the shows 87 episodes, Kim made her final appearance in the hour-long series finale Graduation, which originally aired on September 7, 2007. A high school cheerleader moonlighting as a teenage crime-fighter, the majority of Kims missions involve her thwarting the plans of her archenemy Dr. Drakken, a mad scientist, all-the-while coping with everyday challenges commonly associated with adolescence.\\nInspired by their own daughters, Schooley and McCorkle conceived Kim as a teenage girl capable of doing anything, basing the character on their own childhood hero James Bond. Upon noticing the relative lack of strong female leads in childrens animated television, they decided to reverse traditional gender roles by making Kim the shows action hero accompanied by a male comedic sidekick in the form of best friend-turned-boyfriend Ron Stoppable. Devoid of both superpowers and a secret identity unlike traditional superheroes, the characters crime-fighting abilities are instead drawn from her cheerleading experience, thus making her more relatable to young viewers. Originally designed as a bombshell based on video game character Lara Croft, Kims appearance was ultimately altered to resemble a teenage girl instead.\\nWhen Kim Possible premiered in 2002, Kim was instantly well-liked by both female and male audiences. The character has since been very positively received by critics, who hailed her as a positive role model for young women, while heavily comparing her to similar crime-fighting television heroines Buffy Summers from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Sydney Bristow from Alias, both of whom preceded her. Kim has also earned the respect of feminist critics, who appreciated the character for both defying gender roles and challenging negative stereotypes associated with cheerleaders. A fashion trendsetter, the characters wardrobe is also believed to have helped popularize the wearing of crop tops and cargo pants during the early 2000s. The success of the show inspired the release of two television films, Kim Possible: A Sitch in Time 2003 and Kim Possible Movie: So the Drama 2005, as well as a video game series, in all of which Kim stars."

            "Polyphony literature, In literature, polyphony Russian: is a feature of narrative, which includes a diversity of simultaneous points of view and voices. Caryl Emerson describes it as a decentered authorial stance that grants validity to all voices. The concept was introduced by Mikhail Bakhtin, using a metaphor based on the musical term polyphony.\\nBakhtins primary example of polyphony was Fyodor Dostoevskys prose. According to Bakhtin, the chief characteristic of Dostoevskys novels is a plurality of independent and unmerged voices and consciousnesses, a genuine polyphony of fully valid voices. His major characters are, by the very nature of his creative design, not only objects of authorial discourse but also subjects of their own directly signifying discourse.Polyphony in literature is the consequence of a dialogic sense of truth in combination with the special authorial position that makes possible the realization of that sense on the page. The dialogic sense of truth, as it manifests in Dostoevsky, is a radically different way of understanding the world to that of the monologic. Dostoevskys novels, according to Bakhtin, cannot be understood from within the monological tradition of western thought, a way of thinking about truth that has dominated religion, science, philosophy and literature for many centuries."

Programmed by John Lyon, it relies on a new game engine, called RapidFire, intended to make faster and easier access to wargames published by the studio. During a turn, the program selects the units each in turn and the player only has to order them to move, attack or cast a spell. The order is then executed immediately before the program selects another unit. The game offers two categories of scenarios. The first is composed of medieval-fantasy confrontation, including a free adaptation of the Battle of Gondor against the Mordor forces in the Lord of the Rings. The second is composed of historical battles of antiquity.\\nOn its release, The Shattered Alliance was hailed by the trade press, which praised its graphics and its new game engine, which made it quick and easy to handle. Retrospectively, the French magazine Jeux et Stratgie described it as a very big game by explaining that it is no coincidence that it has held the top of the bill for several years."

            "Do you know where your children are?, Do you know where your children are? is a question used as a public service announcement PSA for parents on American television especially from the late 1960s through the late 1980s. Accompanied by a time announcement, this phrase is typically used as a direct introduction for the originating stations late-evening newscast, typically at either 10:00 p.m. or 11:00 p.m. While the phrase itself had appeared in newspapers as early as the 19th century, usage of it in broadcasting started in the early 1960s following the enactment of nightly youth curfews for minors in multiple large cities.When proposing a nightly youth curfew in the state in early 1961, Massachusetts state senator William X. Wall notably urged all radio and television broadcasters to ask the question on-air, so as to remind parents to check up on their children. The first high-profile usage of the phrase was by KHJ-TV now KCAL-TV channel 9 in Los Angeles in 1964, which had the question read on-air by booth announcers during the nightly 10:00 p.m. station break. Following the adoption of a 10:30 p.m. curfew in Baltimore, WJZ-TV channel 13 began running the announcement at 11:00 p.m. in consultation with the citys mayor Thomas DAlesandro III; this followed a series of documentaries produced by the station regarding issues facing younger generations and was inspired by positive reception of the PSA on Milwaukee television. WJZ-TVs owner Westinghouse Broadcasting quickly adopted this phrase for other stations owned by the chain, including KYW-TV in Philadelphia and WBZ-TV in Boston.WNEW-TV channel 5 in New York City, along with WKBW-TV in Buffalo, New York, are two of the more notable stations to have utilized this announcement. WNEW-TV began using the phrase spoken by Mel Epstein, WNEW-TVs director of on-air promotions, in 1967 in response to the rising level of crime in the city; it is still used by the stationknown as WNYW since 1986on a nightly basis. During the COVID-19 Pandemic, the announcement was adjusted to encourage people to stay home during the pandemic with the phrase Stay home. Stay safe. Stay strong. Were all in this together.The PSA was featured on Time magazines Top 10 Public-Service Announcements list.The PSA was often parodied. The line appeared in the Simpsons episode Bart After Dark, upon which Homer Simpson responded to the television, I told you last night no!, and as the tagline for the 1999 film 200 Cigarettes.\\nMichael Jacksons compilation album Xscape, posthumously released in 2014, includes a track titled Do You Know Where Your Children Are, which was originally recorded in 1986 by Jackson during his Bad sessions, and was reworked between 2013 and 2014.

The game is centered upon two mercenaries fighting through war, political turmoil, and a conspiracy from 1993 to 2009. Focusing on cooperative strategies, Army of Twos main feature is the necessity to use coordinated teamwork to accomplish the games goals. While the game is meant to be played with another human as a partner, a Partner Artificial Intelligence PAI is also included and programmed to follow the players strategies. Dependence on a partner whether human or PAI is so pronounced that most objectives are impossible to complete without it.\\nArmy of Two is one of the first games released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles that feature region-locked online play. EA claims that the region-locking is to prevent network lag caused by players from multiple regions, and to prevent the Asian region console owners from playing the U.S. and European version of the game, as the Asian version has been censored to meet certain requirements notably, the shooting of already dead bodies in the game. Electronic Arts shut down the online multiplayer servers for the game in August 11, 2011.Critics praised its cooperative gameplay but criticized its artificial intelligence and difficulty. Army of Two debuted in positive sales at release. A sequel titled Army of Two: The 40th Day, was released on January 12, 2010."

In Greece, chariot racing played an essential role in aristocratic funeral games from a very early time. With the institution of formal races and permanent racetracks, chariot racing was adopted by many Greek states and their religious festivals. Horses and chariots were very costly. Their ownership was a preserve of the wealthiest aristocrats, whose reputations and status benefitted from offering such extravagant, exciting displays. Their successes could be further broadcast and celebrated through commissioned odes and other poetry. \\nIn standard racing practise, each chariot held a single driver and was pulled by four horses, or sometimes two. Drivers and horses risked serious injury or death through collisions and crashes; this added to the excitement and interest for spectators. Most charioteers were slaves or contracted professionals. While records almost invariably credit victorious owners and their horses for winning, their drivers are often not mentioned at all. Greek chariot races could be watched by unmarried women; married women were banned from watching any Olympic events. A Spartan noble-woman is known to have trained horse-teams for the Olympics and won two races, one of them as driver. In the ancient Olympic Games, and other Panhellenic Games, chariot racing was one of the most important equestrian events. \\nChariot racing was the most popular of Romes many subsidised public entertainments, and was an essential component in several religious festivals. Roman chariot drivers had very low social status, but were paid a fee simply for taking part. Winners were celebrated and well paid for their victories and the best could earn more than the wealthiest lawyers and senators. Racing team managers may have competed for the services of particularly skilled drivers and their horses. The drivers could compete as individuals, or under Team colours: Blue, Green, Red or White. Spectators generally chose to support a single team, and identify themselves with its fortunes. Private betting on the races raised large sums for the teams, drivers and wealthy backers. Violence between rival factions was not uncommon. Rivalries were sometimes politicized, when teams became associated with competing patrons, or social or religious ideas. Roman and later Byzantine emperors, mistrustful of private organisations as potentially subversive, took control of the teams, especially the Blues and Greens, and appointed officials to manage them.\\nChariot racing faded in importance in the Western Roman Empire after the fall of Rome. It survived much longer in the Eastern Roman Empire, where the traditional Roman chariot-racing factions continued to play a prominent role for several centuries. Supporters of the Blue teams vied with supporters of the Greens for control of foreign, domestic and religious decisions, and Imperial subsidies for themselves. Their displays of civil disobedience culminated in an indiscriminate slaughter of Byzantine citizenry by the military in the Nika riots. Thereafter, rising costs and a failing economy saw the gradual decline of Byzantine chariot racing."

One version of the game is the traditional Chinese version intended for players in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The other version uses the simplified version of the Chinese language and is intended for audiences in mainland China. Despite this minor difference, the story line of these two versions are identical. The ultimate goal of the game is to conquer all of ancient China referred to in the game as the world by defeating bandits and local rulers. Because it was an unlicensed game from Taiwan, it was never physically distributed outside of Asia. The player control the three warriors: Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei. These legends of 2nd century China have the ability to cast magical spells on enemies like tigers, barbarians, and various kinds of bosses. There are no random encounters and all encounters are visible like in EarthBound, Chrono Trigger, and Secret of Mana.However, battles can be long and tricky like in other Chinese role-playing games like the Family Computer version of Final Fantasy VII."

It does not include the temperate and polar regions of the Indian and Pacific oceans, nor the Tropical Eastern Pacific, along the Pacific coast of the Americas, which is also a distinct marine realm. The term is especially useful in marine biology, ichthyology, and similar fields, since many marine habitats are continuously connected from Madagascar to Japan and Oceania, and a number of species occur over that range, but are not found in the Atlantic Ocean.\\nThe region has an exceptionally high species richness, with the worlds highest species richness being found in at its heart in the Coral Triangle, and a remarkable gradient of decreasing species richness radiating outward in all directions. The region includes over 3,000 species of fish, compared with around 1,200 in the next richest marine region, the Western Atlantic, and around 500 species of reef building corals, compared with about 50 species in the Western Atlantic.The term first appeared in academic use in oceanography and geopolitics. Scholarship has shown that the Indo-Pacific concept circulated in Weimar Germany, and spread to interwar Japan. German political oceanographers envisioned an Indo-Pacific comprising anticolonial India and republican China, as German allies, against Euro-America. Since the late 2010s, the term Indo-Pacific has been increasingly used in geopolitical discourse. It also has a symbiotic link with the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad, an informal grouping between Australia, Japan, India, and the United States. It has been argued that the concept may lead to a change in popular mental maps of how the world is understood in strategic terms.In its widest sense, the term geopolitically covers all nations and islands surrounding either the Indian Ocean or the Pacific Ocean, encompassing mainland African and Asian nations who border these oceans, such as India and South Africa, Indian Ocean territories such as the Kerguelen Islands and Seychelles, the Malay Archipelago which is within the bounds of both the Indian Ocean and the Pacific, Japan, Russia and other Far East nations bordering the Pacific, Australia and all the Pacific Islands east of them, as well as Pacific nations of the Americas such as Canada or Mexico. ASEAN countries defined as those in Southeast Asia and the Malay Archipelago are considered to be geographically at the centre of the political Indo-Pacific."

Players gain access to more advanced units upon construction of tech buildings and research. The majority of the display screen shows the part of the territory on which the player is currently operating, and, using the small minimap, the player can select another location to view and operate on. The fog of war completely hides all territory appears black which the player has not explored: terrain that has been explored is always visible in gray tones, but enemy units remain visible only so long as they stay within a friendly units visual radius. Buildings remain displayed as the player last saw them, and do not register unobserved changes such as being built, damaged, or repaired, etc.\\nWarcraft II was a commercial hit, with global sales above 3 million units by 2001; roughly two-thirds were sold in the United States. The game strongly influenced the companys next successful RTS, the futuristic StarCraft 1998 in gameplay, and in attention to personality and storyline. In 1996, Blizzard announced Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans, an adventure game in the Warcraft universe, but canceled the project in 1998.

As a citizen of India, I am proud of our countrys rich and varied culture; we have a beautiful land. However, over 620 million people do not use a toilet and nearly as many accept this practice. The result is an unacceptable level of filth in our environment. This is why I have chosen to take a stand and raise my voice with that of many other young people. We want our sisters and brothers to survive, grow and develop as healthy individuals in a clean country. We urgently request your help. Together we can change India.\\nThe website of the campaign contains many puns and some unusual media, including a simple educational video game called Toilet Trek.

In 2011, Howarth returned to OLTL; it was disclosed Todd had been taken hostage and St. Johns version of the character was really Todds identical twin brother, Victor Lord, Jr., conditioned to assume Todds place.\\nTodd was initially a short-term villain, but his popularity with the audience and critics inspired the writers to forgo killing him or permanently sending him to prison, like most soap operas had done with rapists in the past. While keeping aspects of his personality dark or violent, they had Todd exhibit a conscience and compassion. They took steps to redeem him and made him an integral part of OLTLs canvas, despite Howarths objections to a redemption storyline. With the use of literary techniques for the redemptive arc, the writers borrowed from nineteenth-century melodrama and Gothic traditions, and literature such as Frankenstein. Todd became the product of an affair between his father, Victor Lord, and his mother, Irene Manning, which provided him a fortune and ties to other major characters, including his sisters, Tina and Victoria Lord. An important aspect of the character became his appearance, most notably the scar on his right cheek, which emerged as synonymous with him and served to remind him of his past misdeeds against Marty. Music and the use of humor were also key to Todds development. Although he formed many relationships including with his wives, Blair Cramer and Ta Delgado, and fathered children, a defining characteristic of his personality was his resistance to close relationships and sexual intimacy.\\nThe drive to redeem Todd eventually drew Howarth, who always saw Todd as a villain, to leave the show for a year; he was uncomfortable with the redemption storyline and with many fans positive reactions to Todd. Recasting Todd years later with St. John was generally considered successful by viewers and critics. St. John, instead of imitating Howarths portrayal, brought his own spin to the character. After OLTLs cancellation in 2012, Howarth brought Todd to General Hospital GH, but returned, along with St. John as Victor Jr., to the online version of OLTL in 2013, which was cancelled after one year.\\nTodd has been the subject of numerous soap opera articles, feminist studies, and inspired the creation of a doll in his likeness. He has remained a popular and controversial figure since his creation, and is considered one of soap operas breakout characters."

An event is usually considered more newsworthy if there is something unusual about it; a commonplace event is less likely to be seen as newsworthy, even if the consequences of both events have objectively similar outcomes. The result is that rarer events more often appear as news stories, while more common events appear less often, thus distorting the perceptions of news consumers of what constitutes normal rates of occurrence.\\nThe phenomenon is also described in the journalistic saying, You never read about a plane that did not crash.The phrase was coined by Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe 18651922, a British newspaper magnate, but is also attributed to New York Sun editor John B. Bogart 18481921: When a dog bites a man, that is not news, because it happens so often. But if a man bites a dog, that is news. The quote is also attributed to Charles Anderson Dana 18191897.The reasoning errors caused by this phenomenon are associated with the availability heuristic, which is the mental shortcut that relies on the immediate examples that come to mind when evaluating a specific topic. For example, because airplane crashes are frequently reported, they are easy to call to mind. This leads to people having inaccurate perceptions of how dangerous air travel is.Some consider it a principle of yellow journalism."

It features a fantasy setting and motif and 2D computer graphics for normal gameplay, while battle sequences are rendered in 3D.Taking place in the fantasy world of Filgaia, Wild Arms follows the adventures of a band of miscreants and adventurers called Dream Chasers who scour the world in search of excitement and fortune. The player assumes control of a young boy named Rudy who has the ability to operate powerful weapons called Ancient Relic Machines ARMs, forbidden remnants of a lost age that resemble firearms. Along with his companions Jack and Cecilia, the group must use their respective skills to navigate through the vast wastelands and dungeons of Filgaia and prevent an otherworldly threat from reviving their lost leader and destroying the world.Despite its release being somewhat overshadowed by hype for the upcoming Final Fantasy VII, Wild Arms was a critical and commercial success. Since the American branch of Sony Computer Entertainment had only recently lifted its policy against allowing RPGs to be released in the U.S., there were relatively few RPGs available for the system in the U.S. at that time, giving Wild Arms an added advantage in that market. In November 2003, an enhanced remake titled Wild Arms Alter Code: F was released for the PlayStation 2 in Japan, with a North American version produced in 2005. In addition to enhanced graphics, Alter Code: F also features an expanded script, remastered soundtrack, new characters, and additional gameplay scenarios."

Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time and labelled the greatest by FIFA, he was among the most successful and popular sports figures of the 20th century. In 1999, he was named Athlete of the Century by the International Olympic Committee and was included in the Time list of the 100 most important people of the 20th century. In 2000, Pel was voted World Player of the Century by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics IFFHS and was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player of the Century. His 1,279 goals in 1,363 games, which includes friendlies, is recognised as a Guinness World Record.Pel began playing for Santos at age 15 and the Brazil national team at 16. During his international career, he won three FIFA World Cups: 1958, 1962 and 1970, the only player to do so. He was nicknamed O Rei The King following the 1958 tournament. Pel is the joint-top goalscorer for Brazil with 77 goals in 92 games. At club level he is Santos all-time top goalscorer with 643 goals in 659 games. In a golden era for Santos, he led the club to the 1962 and 1963 Copa Libertadores, and to the 1962 and 1963 Intercontinental Cup. Credited with connecting the phrase The Beautiful Game with football, Pels electrifying play and penchant for spectacular goals made him a star around the world, and his teams toured internationally in order to take full advantage of his popularity. During his playing days, Pel was for a period the best-paid athlete in the world. Since retiring in 1977, Pel has been a worldwide ambassador for football and has made many acting and commercial ventures. In 2010, he was named the honorary president of the New York Cosmos.\\nAveraging almost a goal per game throughout his career, Pel was adept at striking the ball with either foot in addition to anticipating his opponents movements on the field. While predominantly a striker, he could also drop deep and take on a playmaking role, providing assists with his vision and passing ability, and he would also use his dribbling skills to go past opponents. In Brazil, he is hailed as a national hero for his accomplishments in football and for his outspoken support of policies that improve the social conditions of the poor. His emergence at the 1958 World Cup where he became the first black global sporting star was a source of inspiration. Throughout his career and in his retirement, Pel received several individual and team awards for his performance in the field, his record-breaking achievements, and legacy in the sport."

In Flicky, the player controls the eponymous blue bird and must gather all the small birds called Chirps in each round and bring them safely to the exit. There are cat and lizard enemies which can disperse the Chirps and kill the player, but Flicky can use items on the playing field to protect herself and the Chirps from danger.\\nThe idea for Flicky came from Sega senior leadership, who wanted to exceed the success of Namcos Mappy 1983. Yoji Ishii and Yoshiki Kawasaki developed Flicky at Sega over one year. Originally, the game simply had the player catch ambiguous dots in a maze. Taking inspiration from a popular song in a Japanese variety show, Kawasaki gave the game an urban theme and bird characters. The game was originally titled Busty, then Flippy, before finally settling on Flicky.\\nFlicky was first ported to the SG-1000 in Japan, and then later to other Japanese home consoles. In 1991, Flicky was released in North America and Europe on the Sega Genesis. The character has made cameo appearances in other Sega games, most notably within the Sonic the Hedgehog series."

            "Down Under, The term Down Under is a colloquialism which is differently construed to refer to Australia and New Zealand, or Pacific Island countries collectively. The term comes from the fact that these countries are in the Southern Hemisphere, below almost all other countries, on the usual arrangement of a map or globe which places cardinal north at the top.The term has been in use since the late 19th century and the persistence of the media use of the term has led to its wide acceptance and usage, especially in reference to Australia. The Men at Work song Down Under became a patriotic rallying song for Australians. The Russian-Australian boxing champion Kostya Tszyu was nicknamed The Thunder from Down Under, as is Australian snooker player Neil Robertson. When the then Miss Australia Jennifer Hawkins was crowned as Miss Universe 2004 in Quito, Ecuador, she was called by the same nickname by host Billy Bush.According to Roger Eberts tongue-in-cheek Glossary of Movie Terms, the Down Under Rule:\\n\\nNo film set in Australia is allowed to use the word Australia in its title where Down Under is an acceptable alternative. For example, we dont get The Rescuers in Australia or Quigley in Australia.\\nThe Tour Down Under is a cycling race in and around Adelaide, South Australia, and since 2009 has been the inaugural event of the UCI World Tour Ranking calendar, which culminates in the Giro di Lombardia.\\n\\n"

The voice for this character was provided by Benny Rubin.Both Joe Jitsu and Go Go Gomez, a Mexican stereotype, have been edited out of some reruns of the Dick Tracy cartoon series. Henry G. Saperstein, then the chairman of UPA, stated Its just a cartoon, for goodness sake. Others pointed out that the stereotypes included two Europeans Hemlock Holmes and Heap OCalorie, who are British and Irish respectively, and that the Joe Jitsu character was a deliberate attempt to re-introduce a sympathetic Japanese character after the passions of the last war had died down."

It is the fourth installment in the Elder Scrolls series, following 2002s The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, and was released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 in 2006, followed by PlayStation 3 in 2007. Taking place within the fictional province of Cyrodiil, the games main story focuses on the player characters efforts to thwart a fanatical cult known as the Mythic Dawn that plans to open portal gates to a demonic realm known as Oblivion.\\nThe game continues the open-world tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any time and to ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely. A perpetual objective for players is to improve their characters skills, which are numerical representations of certain abilities. Early in the game, seven skills are selected by the player as major skills for their character, with those remaining termed as minor skills.\\nDevelopment for Oblivion began in 2002, directly after the release of Morrowind, opting for tighter pacing in gameplay and greater plot focus than in past titles. To design the graphics, Bethesda used an improved Havok physics engine, high-dynamic-range lighting, procedural content generation tools that allowed developers to quickly create detailed terrains, and the Radiant AI system, which enabled non-player characters NPCs to make choices and engage in behaviors more complex than in past titles. The game features fully voiced NPCsa first for the seriesand the music of composer Jeremy Soule.\\nUpon release, Oblivion was a critical and commercial success, winning a number of industry and publication awards. It was praised for its impressive graphics, expansive game world, and schedule-driven NPCs, and is considered one of the greatest games ever made. Following a number of smaller content releases, Bethesda released two expansion packs for the gameKnights of the Nine and Shivering Isleswhich were bundled with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Game of the Year Edition in 2007, and later re-released as a fifth-anniversary edition in 2011.

The character is portrayed by actor David Boreanaz. As introduced in Buffy in 1997, Angel is a love interest for heroine Buffy Summers Sarah Michelle Gellar, a young woman whose destiny as the Slayer is to fight the forces of evil, such as vampires and demons. However, their relationship is complicated by the fact that Angel is himself a vampire cursed with remorse and a human soul, which motivates him to assist Buffy in her duties as Slayer. The characters popularity led to the production of the spin-off Angel, which follows the characters struggle towards redemption after moving to Los Angeles. In addition to the two television series, the character appears in the comic book continuations of both series, as well as much other expanded universe literature.\\nIn the characters backstory, he was born Liam in 18th-century Ireland and, after being sired, assumed the name Angelus, achieving infamy as the most sadistic vampire in European history. After angering a Romani clan, he was cursed with his human soul, leading to great personal torment and the decision to resist the evil impulses that come with being a vampire. He later assumes the shortened name Angel, and over the course of Buffy and Angel, he matures into an altruistic champion of mankind, and learns he is a central figure of several prophecies concerning an approaching apocalypse. In later editions of the comic series, Angel adopted the identity of the masked Twilight and gathered a cabal of humans and demons who had become wary of the rise of multiple Slayers.\\nAngel ended its five-year run in 2004. However, the canonical comic books Angel: After the Fall 20072009, Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight 20072011 and Angel & Faith 20112013 depict the characters continued story, in which he is caught up in events of cosmic proportion and must deal with the fallout from enormous mistakes he has made.\\nSeason two of Buffy and season four of Angel feature storylines in which, deprived of his soul, he resumes his Angelus persona and torments and kills some of his allies. He has attracted significant interest due to his dichotomous personality in the presence or absence of his soul, and the ways in which his relationship with Buffy conforms to and subverts the tropes of romantic drama and horror fiction."

The word derives from the Latin verb narrare to tell, which is derived from the adjective gnarus knowing or skilled. Narration i.e., the process of presenting a narrative is a rhetorical mode of discourse, broadly defined and paralleling argumentation, description, and exposition, is one of four rhetorical modes of discourse. More narrowly defined, it is the fiction-writing mode in which a narrator communicates directly to an audience. The school of literary criticism known as Russian formalism has applied methods that are more often used to analyse narrative fiction, to non-fictional texts such as political speeches.Oral storytelling is the earliest method for sharing narratives. During most peoples childhoods, narratives are used to guide them on proper behavior, cultural history, formation of a communal identity, and values, as especially studied in anthropology today among traditional indigenous peoples.Narrative is found in all forms of human creativity, art, and entertainment, including speech, literature, theatre, music and song, comics, journalism, film, television and video, video games, radio, game-play, unstructured recreation, and performance in general, as well as some painting, sculpture, drawing, photography, and other visual arts, as long as a sequence of events is presented. Several art movements, such as modern art, refuse the narrative in favor of the abstract and conceptual.\\nNarrative can be organized into a number of thematic or formal categories: nonfiction such as creative nonfiction, biography, journalism, transcript poetry, and historiography; fictionalization of historical events such as anecdote, myth, legend, and historical fiction and fiction proper such as literature in the form of prose and sometimes poetry, short stories, novels, narrative poems and songs, and imaginary narratives as portrayed in other textual forms, games, or live or recorded performances. Narratives may also be nested within other narratives, such as narratives told by an unreliable narrator a character typically found in the genre of noir fiction. An important part of many narratives is its narrative mode, the set of methods used to communicate the narrative through a written or spoken commentary see also Aesthetics approach below."

They should reward the first quarter and the hundredth.\\nBushnell came up with the concept based on his experience with his first game Computer Space in 1971. Its controls were based on four otherwise equivalent-looking buttons but with different functions, and Bushnell found that this had confused players that were trying to learn the game due to their lack of familiarity with these types of controls. Bushnell kept this in mind in designing their future games, such as in Pong and Asteroids, to keep the controls simple and easy to grasp while maintaining a challenging gameplay. The concept is also similar to a philosophy developed by George Parker, the founder of board game publisher Parker Brothers. Parker had said that Each game must have an exciting, relevant theme and be easy enough for most people to understand. Finally, each game should be so sturdy that it could be played time and again, without wearing out.This principle is also referred to with the sentence easy to learn, hard or almost impossible to master, which has been adopted by Blizzard Entertainment as a motto and design principle."

Balderston, and Achmed Abdullah. The setting and title come from the 1930 autobiography of the British soldier Francis Yeats-Brown.\\nThe story, which has little in common with Yeats-Browns book, tells of a group of British cavalrymen and high-ranking officers desperately trying to defend their stronghold and headquarters at Bengal against the rebellious natives during the days of the British Raj. Cooper plays Lieutenant Alan McGregor, Franchot Tone, Lieutenant John Forsythe, Richard Cromwell, Lieutenant Donald Stone, Guy Standing, Colonel Tom Stone, and Douglass Dumbrille plays the rebel leader Mohammed Khan, who reads the now often-misquoted line We have ways to make men talk.The film was produced by released by Paramount Pictures. Planning began in 1931, and Paramount had expected the film to be released that same year. However, most of the location footage deteriorated due to the high temperatures, and the project was delayed. It was eventually released in the US in 1935.\\nIt met with positive reviews and good box office results, and was nominated for seven Academy Awards, winning Assistant Director, with other nominations including Best Original Screenplay and Best Picture. The film grossed $1.5 million in worldwide theatrical rentals. Writer John Howard Reid described The Lives of a Bengal Lancer as one of the greatest adventure films of all time."

SimCity features two-dimensional graphics and an overhead perspective. The objective of the game is to create a city, develop residential and industrial areas, build infrastructure, and collect taxes for further development of the city. Importance is placed on increasing the standard of living of the population, maintaining a balance between the different sectors, and monitoring the regions environmental situation to prevent the settlement from declining and going bankrupt.\\nSimCity was independently developed by Will Wright, beginning in 1985; the game would not see its first release until 1989. Because the game lacked any of the arcade or action elements that dominated the video game market in the 1980s, video game publishers declined to release the title in fear of its commercial failure, until Broderbund eventually agreed to distribute it. Although the game initially sold poorly, positive feedback from the gaming press boosted its sales. After becoming a best-seller, SimCity was released on several other platforms, most notably on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System SNES in 1991, in which its gameplay was significantly revised with Nintendos involvement.\\nSimCity sold 300,000 units for personal computers and nearly 2 million units for the SNES. SimCity was met with critical acclaim for its innovative and addictive gameplay despite the absence of action elements. Reviewers considered the game to be instructive and helpful toward the players understanding of the basics of urban planning, politics, and economics. SimCity received numerous awards from news publishers and associations. The success of SimCity marked the beginning of the urban simulation genre of video games, as well as publisher Maxis tradition of producing non-linear simulation games, one of which The Sims would surpass all its predecessors in popularity and become one of the best-selling franchises in the video game industry."

Portrayed by actor Mark Indelicato, Justin is raised by his single mother Hilda, both of whom live with his aunt Betty and grandfather Ignacio. A musical theatre and fashion enthusiast, Ugly Betty follows adolescent Justin as he matures and navigates school, while exploring his sexual orientation. Although the character exhibits stereotypically gay interests and flamboyant mannerisms, the show does not address his sexuality until its fourth season, despite constant speculation and support from his family. \\nJustin was created by series creator Silvio Horta, who partially based the character on his own upbringing as a gay teenager raised by a single mother. The character was created to serve as a comedic foil and advisor to Betty. Deciding Justin was too young to be sexualized, the shows producers opted to leave his sexual orientation undisclosed for much of the series. Indelicato was 11 years old when he was cast as Justin, having auditioned for the role while he was performing in a school musical production. Justins coming out storyline mirrored Indelicatos personal life; the actor was confronting his own sexual orientation while his character was preparing to come out on the series. Instead of immediately coming out to his family, Justin confides in Bettys openly gay co-worker Marc St. James, who helps him cope with high school bullies and dating. Justin finally affirms that he is gay by dancing with his new boyfriend, Austin, at his mothers wedding at the end of the series. \\nBefore Justin came out, Ugly Betty fans heavily speculated about the characters sexual orientation for most of the shows duration. One of the youngest gay characters on television at the time, Justin was well-received by critics and audiences, who praised the subtlety of his coming out storyline. Critics were also very receptive towards Justins acceptance by his family, which was welcomed as a refreshing representation of a Latino American family, as well as his friendship with Marc. Several media publications have since cited Justin among the greatest LGBT characters in television history."

This period was referred to as the Hora de Sangre by Mexicans in South Texas, many of whom fled to Mexico to escape the violence.

At least 100 Mexican Americans were lynched in the 1910s, many in Texas.

The stories were initially printed in the city newspaper, The Manhattan Mercury, during the centennial and later collected into a self-published book by Filinger, who created Kaw to be Kansas answer to other heroes like Bunyan and Pecos Bill. Elmer Tomasch of the Kansas State University Art Department provided ink drawings to illustrate the stories and the book.\\nFiilingers stories related how Johnny Kaw created the Kansas landscape, geography and pioneer trails. Kaw was said to have dug the Kansas River Valley, planted wheat, invented sunflowers, and grown giant potatoes. Kaw even controlled the weather, lopping the funnels off tornadoes and wringing out the clouds to end droughts. His pets were the mascots for the two state universities: a wildcat and a jayhawk, who enjoyed a good fight. The Dust Bowl was said to be a result of their fights.\\nFilingers book was not republished after 1969, but Kansas author Jerri Garretson released a childrens picture book about Johnny Kaw in 1997. Her book was illustrated by another KSU art instructor, Diane A. Dollar. A color edition of the book was published in September 2011 and the original version was included in the 2008 anthology, Kansas Tall Tales."

His behavior is very much in line with a stereotypical oversexed lunkhead or himbo who gets through life on his good looks. He spends most of the series in a mutually parasitic relationship with the equally vapid Jackie Burkhart, whom he continues to obsess over following their numerous breakups.In spite of his stupidity, Kelso is shown on several occasions not to be immature, simply unmotivated. When he is either forced to or chooses to, Kelso displays startling intelligence unbecoming of his usual personality or hi-jinx. Near the end of the series, Kelso becomes one of the first characters to completely break away from adolescence and into adulthood when he impregnates a girl with whom he had a one-night stand.

These were all destroyed; except the one that was handed over to Government who disallowed its publication at the time. In 2000, parts of the commission report were leaked to Indian and Pakistani newspapers.The full report was thought to be declassified by the government in 2000, along with other reports concerning the year 1971.

Its Commodore 64 release was the most popular. Reviewers noted Telengards similarity to Dungeons and Dragons. RPG historian Shannon Appelcline noted the game as one of the first professionally produced computer role-playing games, and Gamasutras Barton considered Telengard consequential in what he deemed The Silver Age of computer role-playing games preceding the golden age of the late 1980s.

It was first formulated by Jim Gray and Gianfranco Putzolu in 1985, and then subsequently revised in 1997 and 2007 to reflect changes in the relative cost and performance of memory and persistent storage.\\n\\nThe rule is as follows:\\nThe 5-minute random rule: cache randomly accessed disk pages that are re-used every 5 minutes or less.\\n\\nGray also issued a counterpart one-minute rule for sequential access:\\n\\nThe 1-minute rule: cache sequentially accessed disk pages that are re-used every 1 minute or less.\\n\\nAlthough the 5-minute rule was invented in the realm of databases, it has also been applied elsewhere, for example, in Network File System cache capacity planning.The original 5-minute rule was derived from the following cost-benefit computation:\\nBreakEvenIntervalinSeconds = PagesPerMBofRAM / AccessesPerSecondPerDisk PricePerDiskDrive / PricePerMBofRAMApplying it to 2007 data yields approximately a 90-minutes interval for magnetic-disk-to-DRAM caching, 15 minutes for SSD-to-DRAM caching and 214 hours for disk-to-SSD caching. The disk-to-DRAM interval was thus a bit short of what Gray and Putzolu anticipated in 1987 as the five-hour rule was going to be in 2007 for RAM and disks.According to calculations by NetApp engineer David Dale as reported in The Register, the figures for disc-to-DRAM caching in 2008 were as follows: The 50KB page break-even was five minutes, the 4KB one was one hour and the 1KB one was five hours. There needed to be a 50-fold increase in page size to cache for break-even at five minutes. Regarding disk-to-SSD caching in 2010, the same source reported that A 250KB page break even with SLC was five minutes, but five hours with a 4KB page size. It was five minutes with a 625KB page size with MLC flash and 13 hours with a 4KB MLC page size.In 2000, Gray and Shenoy applied a similar calculation for web page caching and concluded that a browser should cache web pages if there is any chance they will be re-referenced within their lifetime.\\n\\n"

Controlling one of the six characterseach with their own abilitiesplayers complete levels to progress the story. Sonic Adventure retains many elements from prior Sonic games, such as power-ups and the ring-based health system. Outside the main game, players can play minigames like racing and interact with Chao, a virtual pet.\\nSonic Team began developing Sonic Adventure in 1997, after the cancellation of the Sega Saturn game Sonic X-treme. Led by director Takashi Iizuka and producer Yuji Naka, the team strove to reinvent Sonic for the 3D era of video games. Adventure features a stronger emphasis on storytelling and role-playing elements in contrast to previous Sonic games, while Yuji Uekawa redesigned the series characters for their transition to 3D. Sonic Team attempted to demonstrate the technical prowess of the Dreamcast with realistic graphics and drew inspiration from locations in Peru and Guatemala. The soundtrack was primarily composed by Jun Senoue, who preferred rock music over the electropop of previous Sonic games.\\nFollowing its reveal at the Tokyo International Forum in August 1998, Sonic Adventure was highly anticipated and was released in Japan in December 1998 and worldwide in September 1999. It received critical acclaim and became the Dreamcasts bestseller, with 2.5 million copies sold by August 2006. Reviewers considered Adventure a major technical advancement and praised the visuals and gameplay. Though critics noted glitches and camera problems, and reactions to the audio were mixed, they considered Sonic Adventure an exceptional game; some speculated that it could help re-establish Sega as the dominant console manufacturer after the unsuccessful Saturn.\\nJournalists have retrospectively ranked Sonic Adventure among the best Sonic games, and it is recognized as an important release in both the series and the platform genre. Many characters and concepts introduced in Adventure recur in later Sonic games. A sequel, Sonic Adventure 2, was released in 2001. Adventure was ported to the GameCube and Windows in 2003 with altered graphics and more challenges, while a high-definition version was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2010 and for Windows in 2011. Reviews for these releases were less positive; critics felt the game had not aged well and ran at an inconsistent frame rate."

It has been popularized by originators like Jaojoby and relative newcomers such as Ninie Doniah, Vaiavy Chila and Dr. J.B. and the Jaguars. The style is funky and energetic, dominated by ringing electric guitars, real or synthesized accordion, and call-and-response polyphonic vocals, propelled by heavy electric bass and a driving percussion section typically including a drum kit, djembe and shakers. The syncopated, polyrhythmic beat of salegy is rapid typically around 290BPM and features a distinctive percussion pattern performed on a Western drum kit in 68 or 124 time with accents on the 3rd or 7th beat. The melody and harmonies are often in the A minor key and feature beautiful high-life electric guitar and synthesized accordion lines. The sound of salegy can be heard at night clubs, cabarets, parties and dance floors across the island.\\nSalegy represents an electrified version of the antsa musical style that was traditionally performed at Betsimisaraka and Tsimihety rituals. In addition to their commonalities in tempo, vocal style, and tendency toward minor keys which some attribute to an Arab influence, and which stands in contrast to the major key dominance of Highland music, the salegy shares the antsas structure in that it always features a middle section called the folaka broken which is primarily instrumentalvoice serves only to urge on more energetic dancingand during which the vocalists and the audience will launch into intricate polyrhythmic hand-clapping to the beat of the music."

            "Video game, Video games, also known as computer games, are electronic games that involves interaction with a user interface or input device such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device to generate visual feedback. This feedback mostly commonly is shown on a video display device, such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual reality headset. Some computer games do not always depend on a graphics display, for example text adventure games and computer chess can be played through teletype printers. Video games are often augmented with audio feedback delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes with other types of feedback, including haptic technology.\\nVideo games are defined based on their platform, which include arcade video games, console games, and personal computer PC games. More recently, the industry has expanded onto mobile gaming through smartphones and tablet computers, virtual and augmented reality systems, and remote cloud gaming. Video games are classified into a wide range of genres based on their type of gameplay and purpose.\\nThe first video game prototypes in the 1950s and 1960s were simple extensions of electronic games using video-like output from large room-size computers. The first consumer video game was the arcade video game Computer Space in 1971. In 1972 came the iconic hit arcade game Pong, and the first home console, the Magnavox Odyssey. The industry grew quickly during the golden age of arcade video games from the late 1970s to early 1980s, but suffered from the crash of the North American video game market in 1983 due to loss of publishing control and saturation of the market. Following the crash, the industry matured, dominated by Japanese companies such as Nintendo, Sega, and Sony, and established practices and methods around the development and distribution of video games to prevent a similar crash in the future, many of which continue to be followed. Today, video game development requires numerous skills to bring a game to market, including developers, publishers, distributors, retailers, console and other third-party manufacturers, and other roles.\\nIn the 2000s, the core industry centered on AAA games, leaving little room for riskier, experimental games. Coupled with the availability of the Internet and digital distribution, this gave room for independent video game development or indie games to gain prominence into the 2010s. Since then, the commercial importance of the video game industry has been increasing. The emerging Asian markets and mobile games on smartphones in particular are altering player demographics towards casual gaming and increasing monetization by incorporating games as a service. As of 2020, the global video game market has estimated annual revenues of US$159 billion across hardware, software, and services. This is three times the size of the 2019 global music industry and four times that of the 2019 film industry."

The objective of the game is to arrange descending two-colored 22 blocks to create 22 squares of matching color. A vertical line known as the time line sweeps across the field, erases completed squares, and awards points. Each stage has a skin that affects the background, block colors, music, and the speed of the time line.\\nLumines: Puzzle Fusion is the work of video game designer Tetsuya Mizuguchi, who had worked at Sega. Katsumi Yokota contributed to the graphic designer and assisted Takayuki Nakamura with music composition. Mizuguchi originally wanted to make a music-heavy Tetris-style game, but licensing issues prevented this so he created a new concept for Lumines. Mizuguchi was inspired to make a music game on the PSP, one of the few handhelds on the market with a headphone jack. The game was released as a launch title for the PSP in Japan in December 2004, in North America in March 2005, and in Europe in September 2005. It was later ported for mobile phones, Microsoft Windows, and the PlayStation 2 PS2; a high-definition remaster was made for the PlayStation 4 PS4, the Nintendo Switch, the Xbox One, Windows, and Amazon Luna.\\nLumines: Puzzle Fusion sold over half a million copies in North America, Europe, and Japan, and was awarded Best Handheld Game of 2005 by multiple media outlets. Several publications recognized it as one of the top games of 2005 and one of the best-ever launch titles. It was praised for its music and gameplay; multiple reviewers described it as addictive and drew comparisons with Tetris. The ports received less praise than the original version; critics commended the mobile phone version for its new features but criticized its poor sound quality, while the PS2 port was criticized for omitting some songs present in the original. Reviewers complimented the remastered version for enhancing the quality of sounds and visuals but were disappointed that an online multiplayer mode was not included as a new feature. The game spawned numerous spin-offs and sequels for multiple platforms, becoming the first entry in the Lumines series."

Like other games in the series, Mega Man X7 is an action-platform game in which the player fights through an octet of selectable stages. The game differs from previous side-scrolling entries by featuring fully 3D graphics intermixed with both 3D and 2D gameplay.\\nThe development of Mega Man X7 involved a challenging transition of the well-known Mega Man X characters into 3D. However, the reinvention of the series in both graphical and gameplay respects was met with a hostile critical reception. Reviewers found the games foray into the third dimension well-intended but poorly executed."

            "Lunar Lander (video game genre)",
            "Lunar Lander video game genre, Lunar Lander is a genre of video games loosely based on the 1969 landing of the Apollo Lunar Module on the Moon. In Lunar Lander games, players generally control a spacecraft as it falls toward the surface of the Moon or other astronomical body, using thrusters to slow the ships descent and control its horizontal motion to reach a safe landing area. Crashing into obstacles, hitting the surface at too high a velocity, or running out of fuel all result in failure. In some games in the genre, the ships orientation must be adjusted as well as its horizontal and vertical velocities.\\nThe first Lunar Lander game was a text-based game published under many names, including the Lunar Landing Game, written in the FOCAL programming language for the Digital Equipment Corporation DEC PDP-8 minicomputer by Jim Storer while a high school student in the fall of 1969. Several other versions were written soon after by other programmers in FOCAL and BASIC. The original Lunar Landing Game was converted to BASIC by David H. Ahl, who included three versions in his 1973 book 101 BASIC Computer Games. By the end of the decade, the type of game was collectively known as a lunar lander game.\\nIn 1973, DEC commissioned the creation of a real-time, graphical version of Lunar Lander, which was intended to showcase the capabilities of their new DEC GT40 graphics terminals. The game, written by Jack Burness and named Moonlander, was distributed with DEC computers and displayed at trade shows. In 1979, Atari, Inc. released a vector graphics arcade game version of the concept as Lunar Lander. It has a fuel-for-money system allowing the player to purchase more fuel to continue their current game.\\nLunar Lander games were a popular concept for home computer systems. Commodore published a version called Jupiter Lander for their VIC-20 in 1981. That same year, Electronic Games wrote that sometimes it seems as though every company capable of copying a cassette is trying to sell a game on this theme."

Elliott, The Chocolate Coloured Coon; Max Miller, The Cheeky Chappie; and Billy Bennett, Almost a Gentleman.According to writer Michael Kilgarriff: The heydays for these showbiz strap-lines were the inter-war years, for prior to 1914 performers saw little need for a personalised slogan, contenting themselves with such bald descriptions as Singer, Comedian, or Dancer. By the 1950s, the use of bill matter was seen as old-fashioned."

The instructor teaches basic and advanced techniques, ranging from rudder turns to maneuvers such as the tailslide, Lomcovk and Immelmann turn.\\nFlight Unlimited was the first self-published game released by Looking Glass Technologies. It was intended to establish the company as a video game publisher and to compete with flight simulator franchises such as Microsoft Flight Simulator. Project leader Seamus Blackley, a particle physicist and amateur pilot, conceived the game in 1992. He felt that other flight simulators failed to convey the experience of real flight, and he reacted by coding a simulated atmosphere for Flight Unlimited based on real-time computational fluid dynamics. Aerobatic pilot Michael Goulian endorsed the game and assisted the team in making it more true to life.\\nFlight Unlimited received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success; its sales exceeded 780,000 copies by 2002. Reviewers lauded its realism, flight instruction, graphics and sense of flight, but some criticized its high system requirements. The game was followed by two sequels: Flight Unlimited II 1997 and Flight Unlimited III 1999. A combat-oriented successor, Flight Combat, was released in 2002 as Janes Attack Squadron after a series of setbacks. Soon after Flight Unlimiteds completion, Blackley was fired from Looking Glass.

            "Psychonauts, Psychonauts is a 2005 platform video game developed by Double Fine Productions. The game was initially published by Majesco Entertainment and THQ for Microsoft Windows, Xbox and PlayStation 2. In 2011, Double Fine acquired the rights for the title, allowing the company to republish the title with updates for modern gaming systems and ports for Mac OS X and Linux.\\nPsychonauts follows the player-character Razputin Raz, a young boy gifted with psychic abilities who runs away from the circus to try to sneak into a summer camp for those with similar powers to become a Psychonaut, a spy with psychic abilities. He finds that there is a sinister plot occurring at the camp that only he can stop. The game is centered on exploring the strange and imaginative minds of various characters that Raz encounters as a Psychonaut-in-training/Psycadet to help them overcome their fears or memories of their past, so as to gain their help and progress in the game. Raz gains use of several psychic abilities during the game that are used for both attacking foes and solving puzzles.\\nPsychonauts was based on an abandoned concept that Tim Schafer had during the development of Full Throttle, which he expanded out into a full game through his then new company Double Fine. The game was initially backed by Microsofts Ed Fries as a premiere title for the original Xbox console, but several internal and external issues led to difficulties for Double Fine in meeting various milestones and responding to testing feedback. Following Fries departure in 2004, Microsoft dropped the publishing rights, making the games future unclear. Double Fine was able to secure Majesco as a publisher a few months later allowing them to complete the game after four and a half years of development.\\nDespite being well received, Psychonauts did not sell well with only about 400,000 retail units sold at the time of release, leading to a severe financial loss for Majesco and their departure from the video game market; the title was considered a commercial failure. Psychonauts since has earned a number of industry awards, gained a cult following and has been considered one of the greatest video games ever made. Following the acquisition of the game, Double Fines republishing capabilities and support for modern platforms has allowed them to offer the game through digital distribution, and the company has reported that their own sales of the game have far exceeded what was initially sold on its original release, with cumulative sales of nearly 1.7 million as of December 2015. A sequel, Psychonauts 2, was announced at The Game Awards in December 2015 and was released on August 25, 2021."

The character is a member of the Trill species, and is formed of both a host and a symbiontreferred to as Dax. Ezri was introduced to the series following the death of the previous Dax host, Jadzia Terry Farrell at the end of season six. It had been the producers intention to introduce a new female character bearing the symbiont in order to ensure that Nana Visitor as Kira Nerys was not the only female member of the main cast. There were difficulties in casting initially, and the character changed from one who was intended to be spooky to one who was struggling to deal with all her previous personalities as a result of unexpectedly taking on the Dax symbiont. De Boer was not considered for the part until co-producer Hans Beimler suggested that she should submit an audition tape, which resulted in her invitation to meet with the producers in Los Angeles and in her gaining the role.\\nThe character made her appearance in the first episode of the seventh season, Image in the Sand. The character continued to appear throughout the final season of the series, with her final appearance in the series finale, What You Leave Behind. Her character stepped into the void left by Jadzia amongst the crew, but found that she had to redevelop those previous relationships and learn to get along with Jadzias widower, Worf Michael Dorn. During the course of the season, Ezri becomes less nervous of her role with the crew. She learns from the Dax symbiont and becomes involved romantically with Dr. Julian Bashir Alexander Siddig.\\nThe fan reaction to the character was reported as positive, but several of the Ezri-centric episodes came in for criticism, with producer Ira Steven Behr apologising to de Boer for Prodigal Daughter an episode described as just a mess by writer Ronald D. Moore. The relationship between Ezri and both Worf and Bashir was described as one of five great geek TV love triangles. The inclusion of the character was criticised on the internet, with Ezri being referred to as both an ill-conceived idea and a replacement Dax."

Cuba is located where the northern Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and Atlantic Ocean meet. Cuba is located east of the Yucatn Peninsula Mexico, south of both the American state of Florida and the Bahamas, west of Hispaniola Haiti/Dominican Republic, and north of both Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. Havana is the largest city and capital; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camagey. The official area of the Republic of Cuba is 109,884 km2 42,426 sq mi without the territorial waters but a total of 350,730 km 135,418 sq mi including the exclusive economic zone. Cuba is the second-most populous country in the Caribbean after Haiti, with over 11 million inhabitants.The territory that is now Cuba was inhabited by the Ciboney people from the 4th millennium BC with the Guanahatabey and Taino peoples until Spanish colonization in the 15th century. From the 15th century, it was a colony of Spain, and slavery was abolished in 1882, until the SpanishAmerican War of 1898, when Cuba was occupied by the United States and gained independence in 1902. In 1940, Cuba implemented a new constitution, but mounting political unrest culminated in a coup in 1952 and the subsequent dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista, which was later overthrown in January 1959 by the 26th of July Movement during the Cuban Revolution, which afterwards established communist rule under the leadership of Fidel Castro. The country was a point of contention during the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, and a nuclear war nearly broke out during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba faced a severe economic downturn in the 1990s, known as the Special Period. In 2008, Fidel Castro resigned after 49 years of leadership of Cuba and was replaced by his brother Ral Castro. \\nCuba is one of a few extant MarxistLeninist one-party socialist states, in which the role of the vanguard Communist Party is enshrined in the Constitution. Cuba has an authoritarian regime where political opposition is not permitted. Censorship of information including limits to Internet access is extensive, and independent journalism is repressed in Cuba; Reporters Without Borders has characterized Cuba as one of the worst countries in the world for press freedom.Culturally, Cuba is considered part of Latin America. It is a multiethnic country whose people, culture and customs derive from diverse origins, including the Tano Ciboney peoples, the long period of Spanish colonialism, the introduction of enslaved Africans and a close relationship with the Soviet Union in the Cold War.\\nCuba is a founding member of the United Nations, the G77, the Non-Aligned Movement, the Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States, ALBA, and the Organization of American States. It has currently one of the worlds few planned economies, and its economy is dominated by the tourism industry and the exports of skilled labor, sugar, tobacco, and coffee.

It features 64 teams countries. Each team enters a Regional Qualifying Round Final where it plays a team it actually played in the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification. For example: Spain would face Yugoslavia, an opponent it actually faced in its qualifying group. Or Italy would face Russia, an opponent Italy faced in the UEFA play-offs. If the player beats the opponent, it goes to a group much like the real life World Cup. In fact, the team faces opponents that were actually in its group. For example: Mexico would face the Netherlands, Belgium and South Korea. It is a re-make of Super Sidekicks 3. However, animations and designs were exactly the same. The only difference is teams to reflect the World Cup, kits again to reflect the World Cup, and players to resemble squads from the World Cup teams that did not qualify use line-ups from friendly games and qualifiers. Its slogan is We got the kick.\\nUnlike its arcade counterpart, the Neo Geo version tries to be more of a soccer simulation game. Differences include the Neo Geo version being more slowed down, and more realism added in shooting, passing, etc. A color version of the game was released for the Neo Geo Pocket Color as Neo Geo Cup 98 Plus Color."

It can be strongly associated with nations linked to the former Western Roman Empire and with Medieval Western Christendom.\\nThe civilizations of Classical Greece Hellenic and Roman Empire Latin as well as Ancient Israel Hebraism and early Christendom are considered seminal periods in Western history;. From Ancient Greece sprang belief in democracy, and the pursuit of intellectual inquiry into such subjects as truth and beauty; from Rome came lessons in government administration, martial organization, engineering and law; and from Ancient Israel sprang Christianity with its ideals of the brotherhood of humanity. Strong cultural contributions also emerged from the pagan Germanic, Celtic, Wendic, Finnic, Baltic and Nordic peoples of pre-Christian Europe. Following the 5th-century Fall of Rome, Europe entered the Middle Ages, during which period the Catholic Church filled the power vacuum left in the West by the fallen Roman Empire, while the Eastern Roman Empire Byzantine Empire endured for centuries."

This would occur if a whale decides to strand itself ashore. Actual explosives have also been used to assist in disposing of whale carcasses, ordinarily after towing the carcass out to sea, and as part of a beach cleaning effort. It was reported as early as 1928, when an attempt to preserve a carcass failed due to faulty chemical usages.\\nA widely reported case of an exploding whale occurred in Florence, Oregon, in November 1970, when the Oregon Highway Division now the Oregon Department of Transportation blew up a decaying sperm whale with dynamite in an attempt to dispose of its rotting carcass. The explosion threw whale flesh around 800 feet 240 metres away, and its odor lingered for some time. American humorist Dave Barry wrote about it in his newspaper column in 1990 after viewing television footage of the explosion, and later the same footage from news station KATU circulated on the Internet. It was also parodied in the 2007 American film Reno 911!: Miami and in the 2018 Australian film Swinging Safari.\\nAn example of a spontaneously bursting whale carcass occurred in Taiwan in 2004, when the buildup of gas inside a decomposing sperm whale caused it to burst in a crowded urban area while it was being transported for a post-mortem examination. Other cases, natural and artificial, have also been reported in Canada, South Africa, Iceland, Australia, Denmark, and the United Kingdom. Artificial explosions have also been imposed by governments, and approved by the International Whaling Commission in emergency situations.

Common forms include bar form, 32-bar form, versechorus form, ternary form, strophic form, and the 12-bar blues. Popular music songs traditionally use the same music for each verse or stanza of lyrics as opposed to songs that are through-composedan approach used in classical music art songs. Pop and traditional forms can be used even with songs that have structural differences in melodies. The most common format in modern popular music is introduction intro, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, bridge, and chorus. In rock music styles, notably heavy metal music, there is usually one or more guitar solos in the song, often found after the middle chorus part. In pop music, there may be a guitar solo, or a solo performed with another instrument such as a synthesizer or a saxophone.\\nThe foundation of popular music is the verse and chorus structure. Some writers use a simple verse, hook, verse, hook, bridge, hook method. Pop and rock songs nearly always have both a verse and a chorus. The primary difference between the two is that when the music of the verse returns, it is almost always given a new set of lyrics, whereas the chorus usually retains the same set of lyrics every time its music appears. Both are essential elements, with the verse usually played first exceptions include She Loves You by The Beatles, an early example in the rock music genre. Each verse usually employs the same melody possibly with some slight modifications, while the lyrics usually change for each verse. The chorus or refrain usually consists of a melodic and lyrical phrase that repeats. Pop songs may have an introduction and coda tag, but these elements are not essential to the identity of most songs. Pop songs often connect the verse and chorus via a pre-chorus, with a bridge section usually appearing after the second chorus.\\nThe verse and chorus are usually repeated throughout a song, while the intro, bridge, and coda also called an outro are usually only used once. Some pop songs may have a solo section, particularly in rock or blues-influenced pop. During the solo section, one or more instruments play a melodic line which may be the melody used by the singer, or, in blues or jazz improvised.\\n\\n"

            "Championship Manager, Championship Manager is a series of football-management simulation video games, the first of which was released in 1992.\\nThe Championship Manager brand and game was conceived by brothers Paul and Oliver Collyer. In a scenario typical of many self-made game programming teams in the early days of the industry, the original Championship Manager game was written from their bedroom in Shropshire, England. The brothers subsequently founded a development company to take the game further, Sports Interactive, and moved to Islington, North London. Championship Manager became the most popular football management sim of the later 1990s and early 2000s, regularly setting sales records.In 2003, Sports Interactive split with Eidos, the publishers of Championship Manager. Sports Interactive retained the games database and match engine, producing a new game based on these titled Football Manager. Eidos retained the name and interface, with BGS taking over the development of Championship Manager. Although the two series initially ran alongside one another, the sales of Championship Manager began to fall below those of Football Manager. The most recent full version of Championship Manager was Championship Manager 2010, with an iOS mobile game in 2011 the latest game to date released by Eidos.\\nSquare Enix Europe, owners of the brand after purchasing Eidos, revived Championship Manager under the title of Champ Man in 2013. They have released five games for iOS and Android handheld systems and mobile phones since then."

The developers received an AU $25,000 grant from the Australia Council to make the game, propelling the project to national attention, where the idea received a predominantly negative reception.

            "18-electron rule, The 18-electron rule is a chemical rule of thumb used primarily for predicting and rationalizing formulas for stable transition metal complexes, especially organometallic compounds. The rule is based on the fact that the valence orbitals in the electron configuration of transition metals consist of five n1d orbitals, one ns orbital, and three np orbitals, where n is the principal quantum number. These orbitals can collectively accommodate 18 electrons as either bonding or non-bonding electron pairs. This means that the combination of these nine atomic orbitals with ligand orbitals creates nine molecular orbitals that are either metal-ligand bonding or non-bonding. When a metal complex has 18 valence electrons, it is said to have achieved the same electron configuration as the noble gas in the period, lending stability to the complex. Transition metal complexes that deviate from the rule are often interesting or useful because they tend to be more reactive. The rule is not helpful for complexes of metals that are not transition metals. The rule was first proposed by American chemist Irving Langmuir in 1921."

However, she also suffers from intimacy and daddy issues, due to her upbringing which saw her raised by her mother following her parents separation.\\nChloe comes to Erinsborough to reconnect with her brothers Mark Brennan Scott McGregor and Aaron Brennan Matt Wilson, following their fathers death. Shortly after her introduction, writers established a romantic relationship between Chloe and her boss Leo Tanaka Tim Kano.

Each of the fallacies is concisely defined and illustrated with several relevant examples. For each fallacy, the text gives suggestions about how to address or to attack the fallacy when it is encountered. The organization of the fallacies comes from the authors own fallacy theory, which defines a fallacy as a violation of one of the five criteria of a good argument:\\n\\nthe argument must be structurally well-formed;\\nthe premises must be relevant;\\nthe premises must be acceptable;\\nthe premises must be sufficient in number, weight, and kind;\\nthere must be an effective rebuttal of challenges to the argument.Each fallacy falls into at least one of Damers five fallacy categories, which derive from the above criteria."

Tetras come from Africa, Central America, and South America, belonging to the biological family Characidae and to its former subfamilies Alestidae the African tetras and Lebiasinidae. The Characidae are distinguished from other fish by the presence of a small adipose fin between the dorsal and caudal fins. Many of these, such as the neon tetra Paracheirodon innesi, are brightly colored and easy to keep in captivity. Consequently, they are extremely popular for home aquaria.\\nTetra is no longer a taxonomic, phylogenetic term. It is short for Tetragonopterus, a genus name formerly applied to many of these fish, which is Greek for square-finned literally, four-sided-wing.\\nBecause of the popularity of tetras in the fishkeeping hobby, many unrelated fish are commonly known as tetras, including species from different families. Even vastly different fish may be called tetras. For example, payara Hydrolycus scomberoides is occasionally known as the sabretooth tetra or vampire tetra.\\nTetras generally have compressed sometimes deep, fusiform bodies and are typically identifiable by their fins. They ordinarily possess a homocercal caudal fin a twin-lobed, or forked, tail fin whose upper and lower lobes are of equal size and a tall dorsal fin characterized by a short connection to the fishs body. Additionally, tetras possess a long anal fin stretching from a position just posterior of the dorsal fin and ending on the ventral caudal peduncle, and a small, fleshy adipose fin located dorsally between the dorsal and caudal fins. This adipose fin represents the fourth unpaired fin on the fish the four unpaired fins are the caudal fin, dorsal fin, anal fin, and adipose fin, lending to the name tetra, which is Greek for four. While this adipose fin is generally considered the distinguishing feature, some tetras such as the emperor tetras, Nematobrycon palmeri lack this appendage. Ichthyologists debate the function of the adipose fin, doubting its role in swimming due to its small size and lack of stiffening rays or spines.Although the list below is sorted by common name, in a number of cases, the common name is applied to different species. Since the aquarium trade may use a different name for the same species, advanced aquarists tend to use scientific names for the less-common tetras. The list below is incomplete.\\n\\n"

The player takes on the role of a U.S. mercenary as he trots around the globe hoping to halt a terrorist nuclear weapons plot.\\nThe game, which was built with the Quake II engine, is notable for its realistic depictions of violence, made possible by the GHOUL engine, including the dismemberment of human bodies. This was the games stylistic attraction and it caused considerable controversy, especially in Canada and Germany, where it was classified as a restricted-rated film and listed on the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons, respectively. The technology creates 26 different zones on the bodies of enemies, allowing for vastly different reactions depending upon which one is targeted.\\nThe game sold well initially and critical reception was positive. Two sequels were released: Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix 2002 and Soldier of Fortune: Payback 2007. Soldier of Fortune Online, a massively multiplayer online first-person shooter game, was published in Korea in 2010, but it servers were shut down shortly after its release."

The game is the fourth entry in the Star Soldier series and shares many similarities with its predecessor Super Star Soldier, with Soldier Blade having a heavy emphasis on speed.\\nThe initial idea for Soldier Blade came from Hudson designer Uriko Uribos conversations with other employees over which game to use for the companys upcoming Caravan video game tournament. With the event only six months away, Uribo was hesitant to begin production, however executives from Hudson pushed for him to go forward with the idea. Miscommunication between Uribo and staff lead to several mechanics being altered or changed by mistake, such as several stronger enemies instead being easy to kill.\\nAlthough the game was rushed to meet its deadline, Soldier Blade was liked by critics for its gameplay, visuals and power-up system, though some thought it lacked originality and felt inferior to Hudsons previous shooters for the system, namely Blazing Lazers and Final Soldier. Retrospective reviews were much more positive, with some labeling it one of the TurboGrafx-16s definitive shooter games for its fast-paced gameplay and easy learning curve."

Scott Hawkins designed the game and programmed the original PC version of the game. Scott Hawkins worked with Tremor Entertainment to develop the Dreamcast version of the game.\\nThe game presented swirls of different colors stacked upon each other. The player would try to match up as many of the same colored swirls onscreen as possible, then, when satisfied with a combo, they would press the color, making them disappear. The more swirls one can gather together, the more points earned, as well as a reward of seeing the swirls disappear in different ways. The most rewarding way to see the swirls disappear is when they all go into the air and burst with firework-like sounds and cheers. If a swirl of a certain color is alone within a stack of other colored swirls, the player actually loses points.\\nThe Dreamcast version featured a snake in the bottom right corner of the screen, who would act pleased when the player did well and shook his head when they did poorly. If the player did nothing for an extended length of time, the snake would stare at them and then gesture to the left, towards the play field.\\nOn the Dreamcast, it could be played on Versus mode players compete with one Swirl screen with up to four players, an Email mode if you used the Dreamcast Modem, and it also allowed Split Screen four players with their own swirl play fields. On the PC, split screen is not available, and versus is up to two players. Both versions allowed one to compete with another human player via email Dreamcast players may also play against PC players through this.\\nThe Palm version of Sega Swirl includes a two player head-to-head mode that can be played in real-time over the handhelds infrared port."

The depictions range from the realistic, as in the television documentaries of the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, or the fantastic, as in the monster movies of the 1950s and 1960s.\\nThe growth in interest in dinosaurs since the Dinosaur Renaissance has been accompanied by depictions made by artists working with ideas at the forefront of dinosaur science, presenting lively dinosaurs and feathered dinosaurs as these concepts were first being considered. Cultural depictions of dinosaurs have been an important means of translating scientific discoveries to the public.\\nCultural depictions have also created or reinforced misconceptions about dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals, such as inaccurately and anachronistically portraying a sort of prehistoric world where many kinds of extinct animals from the Permian animal Dimetrodon to mammoths and cavemen lived together, and dinosaurs lived lives of constant combat. Other misconceptions reinforced by cultural depictions came from a scientific consensus that has now been overturned, such as dinosaurs being slow and unintelligent, or the use of dinosaur to describe something that is maladapted or obsolete.\\nDepictions are necessarily conjectural, because petrification and other fossilization mechanisms do not preserve all details. Any reconstruction is thereby an artists view that, in order to stay within the limits of the best knowledge at the time, must necessarily be inspired by other pictures already scientifically proved."

A high-definition port for the Nvidia Shield TV was released in China in December 2017. Like other side-scrolling Super Mario games, the player controls Mario as he travels eight worlds and fights Bowsers henchmen to rescue Princess Peach. New Super Mario Bros. Wii was the first Super Mario game to feature simultaneous cooperative multiplayer gameplay; up to four people can play in cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes, taking control of Mario as well as Luigi and one of two multicolored Toads. The game also introduces Super Guide, which allows the player to watch a computer-controlled character complete a level.\\nShigeru Miyamoto had desired to create a Super Mario game with cooperative multiplayer since the series conception. After failed attempts to integrate it into Super Mario 64 due to hardware limitations, he was able to fully explore the concept with the advent of the Wii and its more advanced hardware capabilities. Having developed New Super Mario Bros. and feeling that it was not as challenging as he hoped, Miyamoto designed New Super Mario Bros. Wii with the intent of accessibility for players of all skill levels. Features such as Super Guide and the ability to enter a floating bubble on command and opt out of doing a certain part of a level was added to cater to beginners, whereas other details, such as an award for not prompting the Super Guide block to appear in any level, were added to provide a layer of difficulty. Shiho Fujii and Ryo Nagamatsu composed the games soundtrack, whereas Koji Kondo, the series regular composer, served as sound adviser.\\nThe game was announced following a slight drop in profits, with Nintendo hoping its release would help to rejuvenate sales of the Wii. New Super Mario Bros. Wii was both critically and commercially successful, receiving particular praise for its multiplayer aspect, although some critics were disappointed by the lack of innovation compared to previous Super Mario titles. It received several honors, including the Best Wii Game award from the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards, IGN, and GameTrailers, and is the fourth-best-selling game for the Wii as of March 2021, having sold 30.32 million copies worldwide.

It has been called the most famous Gilbert and Sullivan patter song. Sung by Major-General Stanley at his first entrance, towards the end of Act I, the character introduces himself by presenting his rsum and admitting to a few shortcomings. The song satirises the idea of the modern educated British Army officer of the latter 19th century.\\nThe song is replete with historical and cultural references, in which the Major-General describes his impressive and well-rounded education in non-military matters, but he says that his military knowledge has only been brought down to the beginning of the century. The stage directions in the libretto state that at the end of each verse the Major-General is bothered for a rhyme. Interpolated business occurs here, and in each case he finds a rhyme and finishes the verse with a flourish.The piece is difficult to perform because of the fast pace and tongue-twisting nature of the lyrics."

It stars an ensemble cast consisting of Jeff Bridges, Cynthia Erivo, Dakota Johnson, Jon Hamm, Cailee Spaeny, Lewis Pullman, and Chris Hemsworth. The plot centers on six strangers and an employee at the El Royale, a hotel located along the CaliforniaNevada border, who arrive with dark personal secrets that eventually intersect on a fateful night in the late 1960s. The film explores themes on morality, faith, and redemption, with the state border and other visualizations representing the concept of right and wrong.\\nGoddard began writing the spec script for the film in November 2016, and compiled a list of songs into his screenplay. After telling major studios to avoid buying the script if they could not buy the licenses for each piece of music, he sold it to 20th Century Fox in March 2017. Principal photography started in January 2018 with cinematographer Seamus McGarvey and finished in April. The El Royale hotel was built entirely on a studio set in Burnaby, Canada, under the supervision of production designer Martin Whist, who had envisioned designing a perfectly symmetrical hotel. Additional filming took place in the United States. During post-production, editing was completed by Lisa Lassek and the musical score was composed by Michael Giacchino.\\nBad Times at the El Royales marketing efforts included posters, trailers, and television advertisements, stylized to evoke nostalgia of the noir genre and to make the movie stand out against other films in theaters. The film premiered in Los Angeles on September 22, 2018, and released on October 12 in the United States. The film underperformed at the box office, grossing $31.9 million against a $32 million budget, in part due to its competition and R-rating from the Motion Picture Association. Critics praised the film for its ensemble cast, soundtrack, and cinematography but criticized its lengthy runtime of 141 minutes. It received various awards and nominations, most notably at the 45th Saturn Awards, for its writing, acting, cinematography, and music.\\n\\n"

She comes to Erinsborough to live with her father, Gary Canning Damien Richardson, after being abandoned by her mother. Early storylines for the character saw her clash with Sheila and Kyle, reconcile with her father, and suffer from low self esteem after being bullied. Xanthe developed a romantic relationship with Ben Kirk Felix Mallard and the characters starred in their own online spin-off. Following a break-up, Xanthe was assaulted by one of her classmates. Towards the end of 2016, Xanthes mother Brooke Butler Fifi Box was introduced, causing several problems between Xanthes family and friends when she scams them out of their money.\\nDuring the following year, Xanthe found herself being manipulated by Finn Kelly Rob Mills, who plots to become Principal of Erinsborough High.

            "Hillary Clinton email controversy, During her tenure as United States Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton drew controversy by using a private email server for official public communications rather than using official State Department email accounts maintained on federal servers. After a years-long FBI investigation, it was determined that Clintons server did not contain any information or emails that were marked classified. Federal agencies did, however, retrospectively determine that 100 emails contained information that should have been deemed classified at the time they were sent, including 65 emails deemed Secret and 22 deemed Top Secret. An additional 2,093 emails were retroactively designated confidential by the State Department.Some experts, officials, and members of Congress contended that Clintons use of a private email system and a private server violated federal law, specifically 18 U.S. Code 1924, regarding the unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or materials, as well as State Department protocols and procedures, and regulations governing recordkeeping. Clinton claimed that her use complied with federal laws and State Department regulations, and that former secretaries of state had also maintained personal email accounts however Clinton was the only secretary of state to use a private server. News reports by NBC and CNN indicated that the emails discussed innocuous matters already available in the public domain. For example, the CIA drone program has been widely discussed in the public domain since the early 2000s; however, the existence of the program is technically classified, so sharing a newspaper article that mentions it would constitute a security breach, according to the CIA.The controversy was a major point of discussion and contention during the 2016 presidential election, in which Clinton was the Democratic nominee. In May, the State Departments Office of the Inspector General released a report about the State Departments email practices, including Clintons. In July, FBI director James Comey announced that the FBI investigation had concluded that Clinton had been extremely careless but recommended that no charges be filed because Clinton did not act with criminal intent, the historical standard for pursuing prosecution.On October 28, 2016, eleven days before the election, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had started looking into newly discovered emails. On November 6, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had not changed its conclusion. Comeys timing was contentious, with critics saying that he had violated Department of Justice guidelines and precedent, and prejudiced the public against Clinton. The controversy received more media coverage than any other topic during the presidential campaign. Clinton and other observers argue that the reopening of the investigation contributed to her loss in the election. Comey said in his 2018 book A Higher Loyalty that his decision may have been unconsciously influenced by the fact that he considered it extremely likely that Clinton would become the next president.On June 14, 2018, the Department of Justices Office of the Inspector General released its report on the FBIs and DOJs handling of Clintons investigation, finding no evidence of political bias and lending support for the decision to not prosecute Clinton. A three-year State Department investigation concluded in September 2019 that 38 individuals were culpable in 91 instances of sending classified information that reached Clintons email account, though it found no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information. Yet a September 2022 Fact Checker analysis by The Washington Post, which followed a tweet by Clinton claiming, I had zero emails that were classified, also quotes the same 2019 State Department report as having noted, None of the emails at issue in this review were marked as classified."

The complement of games, films and cultural references based on Dungeons & Dragons or similar fantasies, characters, and adventures became ubiquitous after the end of the 1970s.\\nDungeons & Dragons, and tabletop role-playing games in general, have exerted a deep and persistent impact on the development of all types of video games, from first-person shooters to real-time strategy games and massively multiplayer online games, which in turn play a significant and ongoing role in modern popular culture.In online culture, the term dungeon has since come to mean a virtual location where people can meet and collaborate. Hence, multi-user dungeons emerged throughout the 1970s and 1980s as a form of social networks or a social virtual reality. By creating a means for players to assemble and explore an imaginary world, the Dungeons & Dragons rules provided a transition from fantasy literary settings, such as those of author J. R. R. Tolkien, to fully virtual worlds.Public figures who play or have played Dungeons & Dragons include comedians Stephen Colbert and Chris Hardwick, musician Moby, and actors Vin Diesel, Matthew Lillard, Joe Manganiello, Mike Myers, Patton Oswalt, Wil Wheaton, and Robin Williams."

He was a caveman with the beetle brows of a Neanderthal who had fallen into a glacial crevasse, or Big Giant Hole in Ice, during the Ice Age, thus preserving his body well enough for scientists to thaw him out in 1988. He subsequently studied law at the Oklahoma City University School of Law. The character exploits his humble origins with thinly-veiled cynicism in order to manipulate others.\\nKeyrock became a defense and personal injury lawyer, and in a later sketch, a politician running for the Senate on the platform of reducing the capital gains tax. He was portrayed as a selfish, well-dressed attorney who repeatedly claimed to be a simple-minded caveman, and would employ simple folk wisdom to win his cases. He also enjoyed significant wealth, driving luxury cars like BMWs and Range Rovers, as well as owning a home on Marthas Vineyard."

Three Japanese radio dramas based on the series, titled Sentimental Night, Kaettekita Sentimental Night, and Only Sentimental Night 2 were produced. A number of non-broadcast Japanese audio dramas have also been produced. Several dojin games have been made based on the characters, including the infamous Sentimental Shooting scrolling shooter, which combines a very engaging and difficult shoot em up with provocative imagery. Its nicknames amongst fans are typically Senchi or the contraction SenchiGura.Following the 1994 hit success of Tokimeki Memorial, NEC Interchannel initiated a cooperation between Tabeta Toshio and the main staff of the Graduation series with game production house Marcus in an attempt to produce a Tokimeki-like game. While the six central characters were cast by Seiji Productions, the remaining six were considered unconventional for the time in that they were selected for public appeal. At the time, many of the staff and cast were unknown by the general public, which spurred a large media sales campaign designed to widen the games exposure and establish it as a new brand. Advertisements and articles were placed in many magazines such as Dengeki Gs Magazine as well as the TBS radio show Sentimental Night which aired in 1997. A unit entitled SG girls was formed and numerous events and concert were held. The promotion paid off, as sales of various related goods took off, the game received a positive reaction from fans, and copies became scarce.\\nIn the Sentimental Journey anime, each episode is presented like an epilogue to the game scenario, focusing on one of the girls and telling a short romantic story. The common thread among the stories is the presence of a nondescript boy possibly not even the same boy who used to be a childhood crush or best friend, or just a short acquaintance, before moving away. This boy would have an influence over the girls present life. The stories range widely from straightforward girl-gets-boy romance to friendships of various sorts and sometimes supernatural events."

            "The Masque of the Red Death, The Masque of the Red Death originally published as The Mask of the Red Death: A Fantasy is a short story by American writer Edgar Allan Poe, first published in 1842. The story follows Prince Prosperos attempts to avoid a dangerous plague, known as the Red Death, by hiding in his abbey. He, along with many other wealthy nobles, hosts a masquerade ball in seven rooms of the abbey, each decorated with a different color. In the midst of their revelry, a mysterious figure disguised as a Red Death victim enters and makes his way through each of the rooms. Prospero dies after confronting this stranger, whose costume proves to contain nothing tangible inside it; the guests also die in turn.\\nPoes story follows many traditions of Gothic fiction and is often analyzed as an allegory about the inevitability of death, though some critics advise against an allegorical reading. Many different interpretations have been presented, as well as attempts to identify the true nature of the eponymous disease. The story was first published in May 1842 in Grahams Magazine and has since been adapted in many different forms, including a 1964 film starring Vincent Price. Poes short story has also been alluded to by other works in many types of media."

Comprising three ciphertexts, the first unsolved text describes the location, the second solved ciphertext accounts the content of the treasure, and the third unsolved lists the names of the treasures owners and their next of kin.\\nThe story of the three ciphertexts originates from an 1885 pamphlet called The Beale Papers, detailing treasure being buried by a man named Thomas J. Beale in a secret location in Bedford County, Virginia, in about 1820. Beale entrusted a box containing the encrypted messages to a local innkeeper named Robert Morriss and then disappeared, never to be seen again. According to the story, the innkeeper opened the box 23 years later, and then decades after that gave the three encrypted ciphertexts to a friend before he died. The friend then spent the next twenty years of his life trying to decode the messages, and was able to solve only one of them, which gave details of the treasure buried and the general location of the treasure. The unnamed friend then published all three ciphertexts in a pamphlet which was advertised for sale in the 1880s.\\nSince the publication of the pamphlet, a number of attempts have been made to decode the two remaining ciphertexts and to locate the treasure, but all efforts have resulted in failure.There are many arguments that the entire story is a hoax, including the 1980 article A Dissenting Opinion by cryptographer Jim Gillogly, and a 1982 scholarly analysis of the Beale Papers and their related story by Joe Nickell, using historical records that cast doubt on the existence of Thomas J. Beale. Nickell also presents linguistic evidence demonstrating that the documents could not have been written at the time alleged words such as stampeding, for instance, are of later vintage. His analysis of the writing style showed that Beale was almost certainly James B. Ward, whose 1885 pamphlet brought the Beale Papers to light. Nickell argues that the tale is thus a work of fiction; specifically, a secret vault allegory of the Freemasons; James B. Ward was a Mason himself."

It originated from African-American music such as jazz, rhythm and blues, boogie woogie, gospel, as well as country music. While rock and rolls formative elements can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until 1954.According to journalist Greg Kot, rock and roll refers to a style of popular music originating in the United States in the 1950s. By the mid-1960s, rock and roll had developed into the more encompassing international style known as rock music, though the latter also continued to be known in many circles as rock and roll. For the purpose of differentiation, this article deals with the first definition.\\nIn the earliest rock and roll styles, either the piano or saxophone was typically the lead instrument. These instruments were generally replaced or supplemented by guitar in the middle to late 1950s. The beat is essentially a dance rhythm with an accentuated backbeat, almost always provided by a snare drum. Classic rock and roll is usually played with one or two electric guitars one lead, one rhythm and a double bass string bass. After the mid-1950s, electric bass guitars Fender bass and drum kits became popular in classic rock.Rock and roll had a polarizing influence on lifestyles, fashion, attitudes, and language. It is often portrayed in movies, fan magazines, and on television. Some people believe that the music had a positive influence on the civil rights movement, because both Black American and White American teenagers enjoyed it."

Placed in direct competition with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 and Fly!, the game failed to capture sufficient market share. It became one of Looking Glasss biggest commercial flops, with roughly 20,000 units sold in the United States during 1999. This contributed to the companys closure in 2000.

Referring to himself as a consulting detective in the stories, Holmes is known for his proficiency with observation, deduction, forensic science and logical reasoning that borders on the fantastic, which he employs when investigating cases for a wide variety of clients, including Scotland Yard.\\nFirst appearing in print in 1887s A Study in Scarlet, the characters popularity became widespread with the first series of short stories in The Strand Magazine, beginning with A Scandal in Bohemia in 1891; additional tales appeared from then until 1927, eventually totalling four novels and 56 short stories. All but one are set in the Victorian or Edwardian eras, between about 1880 and 1914. Most are narrated by the character of Holmess friend and biographer Dr. John H. Watson, who usually accompanies Holmes during his investigations and often shares quarters with him at the address of 221B Baker Street, London, where many of the stories begin.\\nThough not the first fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes is arguably the best known. By the 1990s, there were already over 25,000 stage adaptations, films, television productions and publications featuring the detective, and Guinness World Records lists him as the most portrayed literary human character in film and television history. Holmess popularity and fame are such that many have believed him to be not a fictional character but a real individual; numerous literary and fan societies have been founded on this pretence. Avid readers of the Holmes stories helped create the modern practice of fandom. The character and stories have had a profound and lasting effect on mystery writing and popular culture as a whole, with the original tales as well as thousands written by authors other than Conan Doyle being adapted into stage and radio plays, television, films, video games, and other media for over one hundred years."

            "Manga, Manga Japanese: maga are comics or graphic novels originating from Japan. Most manga conform to a style developed in Japan in the late 19th century, and the form has a long prehistory in earlier Japanese art. The term manga is used in Japan to refer to both comics and cartooning. Outside of Japan, the word is typically used to refer to comics originally published in the country.In Japan, people of all ages and walks of life read manga. The medium includes works in a broad range of genres: action, adventure, business and commerce, comedy, detective, drama, historical, horror, mystery, romance, science fiction and fantasy, erotica hentai and ecchi, sports and games, and suspense, among others. Many manga are translated into other languages.Since the 1950s, manga has become an increasingly major part of the Japanese publishing industry. By 1995, the manga market in Japan was valued at 586.4 billion $67 billion, with annual sales of 1.9 billion manga books and manga magazines in Japan equivalent to 15 issues per person. In 2020 Japans manga market value hit a new record of 612.6 billion due to the fast growth of digital manga sales as well as increase of print sales. Manga have also gained a significant worldwide audience. Beginning with the late 2010s manga started massively outselling American comics. In 2020 the North American manga market was valued at almost $250 million. According to NPD BookScan manga made up 76% of overall comics and graphic novel sales in the US in 2021. The fast growth of the North American manga market has been attributed to mangas wide availability on digital reading apps, book retailer chains such as Barnes & Noble and online retailers such as Amazon as well as the increased streaming of anime. According to Jean-Marie Bouissou, manga represented 38% of the French comics market in 2005. This is equivalent to approximately 3 times that of the United States and was valued at about 460 million $640 million. In Europe and the Middle East, the market was valued at $250 million in 2012.Manga stories are typically printed in black-and-whitedue to time constraints, artistic reasons as coloring could lessen the impact of the artwork and to keep printing costs lowalthough some full-color manga exist e.g., Colorful. In Japan, manga are usually serialized in large manga magazines, often containing many stories, each presented in a single episode to be continued in the next issue. Collected chapters are usually republished in tankbon volumes, frequently but not exclusively paperback books. A manga artist mangaka in Japanese typically works with a few assistants in a small studio and is associated with a creative editor from a commercial publishing company. If a manga series is popular enough, it may be animated after or during its run. Sometimes, manga are based on previous live-action or animated films.Manga-influenced comics, among original works, exist in other parts of the world, particularly in those places that speak Chinese manhua, Korean manhwa, English OEL manga, and French manfra, as well as in the nation of Algeria DZ-manga."

By extension, it is also often heard at funerals, graduations, and as a farewell or ending to other occasions; for instance, many branches of the Scouting movement use it to close jamborees and other functions.The text is a Scots-language poem written by Robert Burns in 1788 but based on an older Scottish folk song. In 1799, it was set to a traditional tune, which has since become standard. Auld Lang Syne is listed as numbers 6294 and 13892 in the Roud Folk Song Index.\\nThe poems Scots title may be translated into standard English as old long since or, less literally, long long ago, days gone by, times long past or old times. Consequently, For auld lang syne, as it appears in the first line of the chorus, might be loosely translated as for the sake of old times.\\nThe phrase Auld Lang Syne is also used in similar poems by Robert Ayton 15701638, Allan Ramsay 16861757, and James Watson 1711, as well as older folk songs predating Burns.

The beat is often defined as the rhythm listeners would tap their toes to when listening to a piece of music, or the numbers a musician counts while performing, though in practice this may be technically incorrect often the first multiple level. In popular use, beat can refer to a variety of related concepts, including pulse, tempo, meter, specific rhythms, and groove.\\nRhythm in music is characterized by a repeating sequence of stressed and unstressed beats often called strong and weak and divided into bars organized by time signature and tempo indications.\\nBeats are related to and distinguished from pulse, rhythm grouping, and meter:\\n\\nMeter is the measurement of the number of pulses between more or less regularly recurring accents. Therefore, in order for meter to exist, some of the pulses in a series must be accentedmarked for consciousnessrelative to others. When pulses are thus counted within a metric context, they are referred to as beats.\\nMetric levels faster than the beat level are division levels, and slower levels are multiple levels. Beat has always been an important part of music. Some music genres such as funk will in general de-emphasize the beat, while other such as disco emphasize the beat to accompany dance.\\n\\n"

Another definition implies the act of imitation, usually with limited knowledge and/or concern for the consequences.\\nVersions of the saying that appeared in U.S. commercial advertisements for shoes and other apparel in the 1890s suggested it was popularly established by then, and an article in Sharpes London Magazine half a century earlier had pointed to monkeys habit of mimicry: Whatever a monkey sees men do, he must affect to do the like himself. The West African folklore tale of a peddler whose wares are ransacked by monkeys that proceed to imitate his gestures of outrage has been retold by Esphyr Slobodkina in Caps for Sale A Tale of a Peddler, Some Monkeys and Their Monkey Business and by Baba Wagu Diakit in The Hatseller and the Monkeys. Diakit notes that versions of his tale also are found in Egypt, Sudan, India, and England, and indeed have existed in Europe since the Middle Ages.Jazz singer-songwriter Michael Franks used the saying as the subject and title of his song Monkey See Monkey Do on his 1976 album The Art of Tea.

Depending on context or application it can be considered a valid common-sense observation or a misunderstanding of probability. This notion can lead to the gamblers fallacy when one becomes convinced that a particular outcome must come soon simply because it has not occurred recently e.g. believing that because three consecutive coin flips yielded heads, the next coin flip must be virtually guaranteed to be tails.\\nAs invoked in everyday life, the law usually reflects wishful thinking or a poor understanding of statistics rather than any mathematical principle. While there is a real theorem that a random variable will reflect its underlying probability over a very large sample, the law of averages typically assumes that an unnatural short-term balance must occur. Typical applications also generally assume no bias in the underlying probability distribution, which is frequently at odds with the empirical evidence."

The meme is composed of a still screenshot from the movie, showing the character Willy Wonka portrayed by the American actor Gene Wilder, accompanied by a short sentence that varies based on the context the meme is used in.The meme has been used to convey sarcasm and a patronising attitude, sometimes through its combination with another meme such as Welcome to the Internet and You must be new here. Another common variation begins with the words So, tell me about. and then continues with a subordinate clause that is deemed impossible by the author. In this way, the target reader is invited to share the condescending sentiment of the memes author towards the criticized recipient. However, the scene in the movie the still is based on is actually neither patronizing nor sarcastic in tone. Some initial versions of the meme, with sexual innuendoes, were called Creepy Wonka, but eventually diminished in popularity compared to the version dubbed Condescending Wonka the name was coined in the online Reddit community. Less common variants of the name include Patronizing Wonka or Sarcastic Wonka.It has been estimated that tens if not hundreds of thousands of variants of the meme, with different captions, have subsequently been created.

Released in Germany for DOS in April 1996, and in the United Kingdom and North America in August, it is the second game in The Settlers series, following The Settlers 1993. In December, Blue Byte released an expansion, The Settlers II Mission CD, featuring new single-player campaign missions, new maps for both single-player and multiplayer modes, and a map editor. In October 1997, they released The Settlers II: Gold Edition, containing the original game, plus the Mission CD expansion, along with minor graphical enhancements and gameplay tweaks. The Gold Edition was also ported to Mac OS in 1997. In 2006, an enhanced remake, The Settlers II 10th Anniversary, was released for Microsoft Windows. In 2007, the Gold Edition was ported to the Nintendo DS, under the title The Settlers, released in Germany in July, and in the United Kingdom and North America in August. Although adapted for the dual-screen display of the DS, and with controls specifically programmed for use with the DS stylus, the gameplay, game mechanics, graphics and storyline are unaltered. In 2009, the original Gold Edition was released on GOG.com, and in 2018, it was re-released for Microsoft Windows as The Settlers II: Veni, Vidi, Vici - History Edition.\\nThe game can be played in either single-player campaign mode or in Free game mode; individual scenarios with predetermined rules set by the player, which can be played with or against either another player, the computer, or both another player and the computer. In the single-player campaign, the player controls a group of Romans who are shipwrecked on an uncharted island. Led by their captain, Octavius, they must use a series of magical portals to try to find their way back to the Empire. During their travels, they come into conflict with Nubians, Vikings and Japanese. In the single-player campaign included with the Mission CD, the player controls Octaviuss great-grandson as he attempts to conquer the entire world.\\nIn making The Settlers II, Blue Byte wanted to improve upon the first Settlers title to as much of an extent and in as many ways as they could. To this end, they sought fan feedback from the first game, and hired Thomas Huser, who had worked on quality assurance for The Settlers, as the lead designer. Although the core supply and demand-based gameplay is broadly the same as in the first game, many other aspects of the gameplay and game mechanics have been altered. For example, the sound effects and graphics have been enhanced, with more on-screen movements and more animations for the settlers themselves, and with four aesthetically distinct races; the economic system is more complex; the battle system is more strategic, with the player able to use scouts and stationary offensive weaponry; and a story-driven single-player campaign has been included.\\nThe original game received positive reviews, with critics especially praising the supply and demand gameplay, the complex economic system and the graphics. The most common criticisms were the lack of direct control during combat, and the absence of an online multiplayer mode. The game was a commercial success, selling over 600,000 units worldwide, considerably more than the original Settlers. The DS remake received negative reviews, with many critics arguing it tarnished the legacy of the original, citing unresponsive controls, a poorly implemented HUD, and, especially, game breaking bugs."

Dickson returned in 1983 and, although she stated that she would never leave the role again, she was replaced by Jess Walton in 1987, who continues in the role to present time.\\nWhen she debuted, Jill was an 18-year-old manicurist working to support her struggling family. The character is known for her rivalry with Katherine Chancellor Jeanne Cooper, which is the longest feud in the history of American soap operas. Their rivalry began when she fell in love and slept with Katherines husband Phillip Chancellor II Donnelly Rhodes and became pregnant. Following Phillips accidental death, the women fought over custody of Jills son, Phillip Chancellor III Thom Bierdz, as well as numerous of Katherines other husbands. A 2003 plot twist shockingly revealed Jill to be Katherines long lost biological daughter, although in 2009, former head writer Maria Arena Bell rewrote their history, reversing that decision. In 2010, Jill discovered she is the daughter of Neil Fenmore Jim Storm.\\nThe character is considered an icon on the soap opera, and has been described as an integral part of the series. Both Dickson and Walton have characterized her as manipulative. Walton, who classes her as a savvy businesswoman, has opined she is similar to Gone with the Wind character Scarlett OHara. Critics have described her as both vindictive and a vixen. John Goudas of The Miami News said that the show flourishes when her character takes center stage, while Nekeeta Borden of Zap2it noted that Jill has always craved a sense of belonging despite her personality.

Although definitions vary, a mountain may differ from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is usually higher than a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres 1,000 feet above the surrounding land. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in mountain ranges.Mountains are formed through tectonic forces, erosion, or volcanism, which act on time scales of up to tens of millions of years. Once mountain building ceases, mountains are slowly leveled through the action of weathering, through slumping and other forms of mass wasting, as well as through erosion by rivers and glaciers.High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level at similar latitude. These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystems of mountains: different elevations have different plants and animals. Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate, mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction, such as mining and logging, along with recreation, such as mountain climbing and skiing.\\nThe highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Asia, whose summit is 8,850 m 29,035 ft above mean sea level. The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars at 21,171 m 69,459 ft."

Warm surface water is generally saltier than the cooler deep or polar waters; in polar regions, the upper layers of ocean water are cold and fresh. Deep ocean water is cold, salty water found deep below the surface of Earths oceans. This water has a very uniform temperature, around 0-3 C. The ocean temperature also depends on the amount of solar radiation falling on its surface. In the tropics, with the Sun nearly overhead, the temperature of the surface layers can rise to over 30 C 86 F while near the poles the temperature in equilibrium with the sea ice is about 2 C 28 F. There is a continuous circulation of water in the oceans. Thermohaline circulation THC is a part of the large-scale ocean circulation that is driven by global density gradients created by surface heat and freshwater fluxes. Warm surface currents cool as they move away from the tropics, and the water becomes denser and sinks. The cold water moves back towards the equator as a deep sea current, driven by changes in the temperature and density of the water, before eventually welling up again towards the surface. \\nOcean temperature as a term is used either for the temperature in the ocean at any depth, or specifically for the ocean temperatures that are not near the surface in which case it is synonymous with deep ocean temperature.\\nIt is clear that the oceans are warming as a result of climate change and this rate of warming is increasing.:9 The upper ocean above 700 m is warming fastest, but the warming trend extends throughout the ocean."

In 2007, the inmates of Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center CPDRC, a maximum security prison in Cebu, the Philippines, imitated the zombie dance featured in the music video of Michael Jacksons Thriller. The footage, uploaded onto video-sharing website YouTube, became a viral video. The idea behind the dance came from the prisons chief, Byron F. Garcia. Garcia first conceived the idea of exercising as an enjoyable way of keeping the prisoners mentally and physically fit. Music was then added to provide additional motivation. The convicts marched and danced to several songs, including In the Navy and Y.M.C.A. by the Village People.\\nGarcia posted the prisoners dance regimes onto the internet in April 2007. The most popular of the presentations was their Thriller performance. The video showed over 1,500 male inmates emulating Michael Jacksons dance moves from the original Thriller short film. Jackson fan Crisanto Nierre played the role of the pop star, with the openly gay former pizza chef Wenjiel Resane playing his girlfriend. The video became one of the most viewed on the internet, receiving 300,000 views per day at its peak. As of November 12, 2016, the Thriller viral video has received over 57 million reported views. The clip also garnered complaints, with one professor stating that the dancing does not rehabilitate CPDRC inmates. The prison and its officers faced allegations of prisoner abuse, claims which both the officers and inmates denied.\\nThe prisoners have performed numerous other songs, including Radio Ga Ga, Together in Electric Dreams, Holding Out for a Hero, and several songs from Sister Act. One of their performances involves the inmates holding portraits of figures such as the Dalai Lama, Pope John Paul II and Mahatma Gandhi. As a result of the prisoners internet fame, many visitors come to CPDRC to view the monthly performances held by the convicts. Their presentations are seen from viewing platforms surrounding the exercise yard. At the jail, visitors can have their pictures taken with the inmates. They can also buy souvenir prison shirts."

The narrative follows archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft as she races to imprison the Egyptian god Set after accidentally setting him free. Gameplay features Lara navigating levels split into multiple areas and room complexes, fighting enemies and solving puzzles to progress.\\nProduction of The Last Revelation began in 1998. Due to the strain of developing Tomb Raider titles non-stop since 1996, and general fatigue with the character, the Core Design staff wrote the narrative to end with Laras death. While the same basic engine was used, it was extensively redesigned for better graphics and more intelligent enemy behaviour. The Dreamcast version emerged following the end of Sonys PlayStation exclusivity agreement with Eidos. The music was composed by Peter Connelly in his first major work on the series.\\nReception of the game was generally positive, with many praising it as a return to form, but noting a lack of major innovation. Several critics felt the series was becoming stale. The Dreamcast port was generally criticised for its poor technical performance compared to other platforms. As of 2009, The Last Revelation was the fourth best-selling Tomb Raider title with over five million copies sold worldwide. Eidos insisted the series continue, and two more Tomb Raider titles began production at the same time; Tomb Raider Chronicles for the same platforms as The Last Revelation, and The Angel of Darkness for the next console generation.\\n\\n"

It was the first Mega Man game for the 16-bit console and the first game in the Mega Man X series, a spin-off to the original Mega Man series that began on the SNESs predecessor, the Nintendo Entertainment System NES. Mega Man X was released in Japan on December 17, 1993 and was released in both North America and Europe the following year. Taking place a century after the original Mega Man series, Mega Man X is set in a futuristic world populated by both humans and Reploids, robots capable of thinking, feeling, and growing like their human creators. Because of these complex attributes, many Reploids are prone to destructive, renegade activity and are thereafter referred to as Mavericks. The plot of the game follows the protagonist X, an android member of a military task force called the Maverick Hunters. With the help of his partner Zero, X must thwart the plans of Sigma, a powerful Maverick leader wishing to bring about human extinction.\\nWith the transition to more advanced gaming hardware, series artist Keiji Inafune explained that the development of Mega Man X involved reinventing Mega Man through gameplay expansion and a more mature storyline while still maintaining the basic concepts on which the franchise was built. Much like the NES Mega Man games that came before it, Mega Man X is a standard action-platform game where the player takes control of the eponymous character and must complete a set of eight, initial stages in any order desired. Defeating the boss character at the end of each stage grants the player one new weapon that can then be toggled and used at will for the remainder of the game. However, Mega Man X adds a number of new features and makes radical changes to the original gameplay mechanics of previous releases in the series. These include allowing the player to dash along the ground, scale walls, and obtain armor attachments which grant special abilities.\\nMega Man X has met with positive reviews for its gameplay, sound, and graphics, as well as its attempt to augment the aging Mega Man franchise. It is considered one of the greatest video games ever made. A longterm commercial success on the SNES, Mega Man X has since been ported to personal computers PCs and mobile devices, included in the North American Mega Man X Collection for the Nintendo GameCube and PlayStation 2 PS2, and released on the Virtual Console download service for the Wii, the Wii U, and the New Nintendo 3DS. The game also received a remake on the PlayStation Portable PSP titled Mega Man Maverick Hunter X. Nintendo re-released Mega Man X in September 2017 as part of the companys Super NES Classic Edition, and a limited physical re-release for the SNES in celebration of Mega Mans 30th Anniversary due for release in September 2018 and published by iam8bit.

It was sparked by new discoveries and research indicating that dinosaurs may have been active and warm-blooded animals, rather than cold-blooded and sluggish as had been the prevailing view and description during the first half of the twentieth century.\\nThe new view of dinosaurs was championed by John Ostrom, who argued that birds evolved from coelurosaurian dinosaurs, and particularly Robert Bakker who argued passionately that dinosaurs were warm-blooded in a way similar to modern mammals and birds. Bakker frequently portrayed his ideas as a renaissance of those popular in the late nineteenth century, referring to the period in between the Dinosaur Wars and the dinosaur renaissance as the dinosaur doldrums.The dinosaur renaissance led to a profound shift in thinking on nearly all aspects of dinosaur biology, including physiology, evolution, behaviour, ecology and extinction. It also led to many depictions of dinosaurs in popular culture."

The players goal is to hold water bubbles falling on a 3D isometric landscape. To do this, enclosures are created with Uppers, which fall in a similar manner to Tetris blocks, that raise the ground. While water can be evaporated with fireballs, hazards such as Mines, Ice Cubes, and earthquakes also fall and ruin the players construction.\\nThe Pickfords conceived a Tetris-esque puzzle game out of a water demo they worked on for another one of their Zed Two games, the hack and slash Vampire Circus. For design, the biggest focus was on the basic elements interaction with each other, as well as the puzzle game styles originality; the use of falling blocks was the only similarity between Wetrix and Tetris. Zed Two signed a two-game deal with Ocean Software, a week before its merge with Infogrames. It required the brothers to turn Vampire Circus into Taz Express 2000, while allowing the brothers free rein with Wetrix. The PC version was produced from January to October 1997 by the brothers themselves, while the Nintendo 64 port was developed with three additional programmers from around June to Christmas 1997.\\nThe Nintendo 64 version sold over 105,000 units in the West, and just above 12,000 in Japan, while the PC version sold 30,000 copies.

The critical and commercial success motivated Imagineer, developers of the Game Boy Color port, to commission Zed Two to develop a sequel, the PlayStation 2 launch title Aqua Aqua, which made little alterations to the main gameplay."

Development was led by John Cook and Robin Walker, the developers of the original Team Fortress mod. Team Fortress 2 was announced in 1998 under the name Team Fortress 2: Brotherhood of Arms. Initially, the game had more realistic, militaristic visuals and gameplay, but this changed over the protracted nine years of development. After Valve released no information for six years, Team Fortress 2 regularly featured in Wired News annual vaporware list among other entries. Finally released on the Source game engine in 2007, Team Fortress 2 would preserve much of the core class-based gameplay of its predecessors while featuring an overhauled, cartoon-like visual style influenced by the works of J.

In June 2011, the game became free-to-play, supported by microtransactions for in-game cosmetics. A drop system was also added and refined, allowing free-to-play users to periodically receive in-game equipment and items.

            "Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated, Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated also known as Mystery Incorporated or Scooby-Doo! Mystery, Inc. is an American animated television series that serves as the eleventh incarnation of the Scooby-Doo media franchise created by Hanna-Barbera, as well as the first that was not originally run on Saturday mornings. The series is produced by Warner Bros. Animation for Cartoon Network UK and premiered in the United States on Cartoon Network on April 5, 2010, with the next twelve episodes continuing, and the first episode re-airing, on July 12, 2010. The series concluded on April 5, 2013, after two seasons and fifty-two episodes.\\nMystery Incorporated returns to the early days of Scooby and the gang, when they are still solving mysteries in their home town, though it makes multiple references to previous incarnations of the franchise. The series takes a tongue-in-cheek approach to the classic Scooby-Doo formula, with increasingly outlandish technology, skills and scenarios making up each villains story, and a different spin on the famous meddling kids quote at the end of every episode. Contrasting sharply with this, however, are two elements that have never been used in a Scooby-Doo series before: a serial format with an ongoing story arc featuring many dark plot elements that are treated with near-total seriousness, and ongoing relationship drama among the characters. Furthermore, it is also the first series in the franchise to make use of real ghosts and monsters since The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo.\\nThe series pays homage to the horror genre, drawing on many works from film, television and literature in both parodic and serious ways, from horror film classics like A Nightmare on Elm Street, modern films such as Saw, television series Twin Peaks, and the works of H. P. Lovecraft, alongside the classic monster horror films shown in previous series. In particular, in the second season, the central story arc evolves to heavily feature the use of Babylonian mythology, exploring the Anunnaki, the Babylonian and modern pseudo-scientific concepts of Nibiru, and the writings of Zecharia Sitchin. Other Hanna-Barbera characters occasionally guest-star, such as Captain Caveman, Jabberjaw, Speed Buggy, The Funky Phantom, and Blue Falcon and Dynomutt.\\nAs was the case with the previous three installments in the franchise, Mystery Incorporated redesigns the main characters, this time into a retro look that returns them to their original 1969 outfits, with some small changes such as Velma now wearing bows in her hair. The series is also the animated debut of Matthew Lillard as the voice of Shaggy, after he portrayed the character in two live-action films, Scooby-Doo 2002 and Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed 2004. Casey Kasem, the original voice of Shaggy, voiced Shaggys father in five episodes, albeit uncredited; this would be his last voice-acting role before his death. Linda Cardellini, who played Velma in the live-action movies, voiced Hot Dog Water, a recurring character in the series. The show also brought back characters seen in previous Scooby-Doo series such as the eco-goth rock band The Hex Girls and Vincent Van Ghoul from The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo, though his character is portrayed as a direct homage to Vincent Price, being a famous horror film actor, rather than an actual warlock.\\nIn 2019, the series was made available to stream on Netflix in the US, along with Whats New, Scooby-Doo?.\\n\\n"

Pausch had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in September 2006. On September 19, 2006, Pausch underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy to remove the malignant tumor from his pancreas. In August 2007, doctors discovered that the cancer had recurred. Pausch was given a terminal diagnosis and told to expect that three to six months of good health remained.The lecture was upbeat and humorous, alternating between wisecracks, insights on computer science and engineering education, advice on building multi-disciplinary collaborations, working together with other people, offering inspirational life lessons, and performing push-ups on stage. Pausch commented on the irony that the Last Lecture series had recently been renamed Journeys: I thought, damn, I finally nailed the venue and they renamed it. After Pausch finished his lecture, Steve Seabolt, on behalf of Electronic Arts, which was collaborating with CMU in the development of Alice 3.0, pledged to honor Pausch by creating a memorial scholarship for women in computer science, in recognition of Pauschs support and mentoring of women in CS and engineering.\\nProfessor Pauschs Last Lecture has received attention and recognition both from American media and news sources worldwide.

            "Meldrick Lewis, Meldrick Lewis is a fictional character on the television series Homicide: Life on the Street, played by Clark Johnson. The character is loosely based on Baltimore detective Donald Waltemeyer and appeared in the series for its entire run. Lewis had the very first and last lines of the series.\\nBorn on September 10, 1962, Lewis was raised in Baltimores Lafayette Court housing project. In 1996, he watched its demolition and kept a brick from the rubble as a memento. He attended Lake Clifton High School from 1976 to 1980. It is indicated he was raised Baptist, but his wedding was performed by a member of the Universal Life Church.\\nLewis joined the homicide unit in April 1990. His first partner in the series was Steve Crosetti, who occasionally irritated him with his arcane historical interests and demeanor. The two usually got along well, however, so Crosettis later suicide deeply unnerved Lewis. At first he refused to even believe it could be a suicide, reasoning that Crosetti, a devout Catholic and devoted father, would never violate his faith and abandon his child. In time he accepted Crosettis suicide but still felt a certain dismay that he had never known Crosetti was in that kind of pain and apparently felt he could not tell Lewis about his problems. Stan Bolander comforted Lewis by saying that in giving up his prized vintage yo-yo as a gift to Lewis, Crosetti was in his own way saying goodbye.\\nLewis remained without a partner for a time until partnering with Mike Kellerman, who transferred into Homicide from the arson unit at the start of Season 4. This partnership initially worked reasonably well, but had some strains as Kellerman slid toward alcoholism and humiliation when he was falsely accused of having taken bribes while in his previous position. As Kellerman kept his problems less secret than Crosetti, Lewis was able to stop a potential suicide attempt.\\nLewis and Kellerman had earlier found themselves arguing with each other over a Nation of Islam group acting as a private security force in a Baltimore City housing project. During a homicide investigation, the Muslims baited Kellerman with racial remarks, and it did not help when Lewis agreed with the Muslims presence in the projects as because of them, there were fewer homicides in the projects. Lewis nonetheless forced the Muslims leader to answer both him and Kellerman the leader would only speak to Black homicide detectives about the identity of a murder suspect during an attempt at turning the two against each other.\\nWhen Kellerman and Lewis were finally able to snare drug kingpin Luther Mahoney for drug trafficking and murder, Lewis beat up Mahoney until he grabbed Lewis gun. However, Kellerman and Terri Stivers showed up in time to prevent Mahoney from killing Lewis, and Kellerman shot and killed Mahoney during an ambiguous standoff. Although Lewis initially approved of Kellermans actions, he later decided they could no longer be partners.\\nDuring Season 6, Lewis got into an altercation with Mahoneys sister Georgia Rae and was suspended. He persuaded fellow detective Paul Falsone to feed him information about the organization, which he used to start an internal war that eventually led to a bloodbath for both the police and the criminals. Kellerman finally admitted the truth about the Mahoney shooting - that the man had not been pointing Lewis weapon at anyone when Kellerman shot him - and resigned in order to keep Lewis and Stivers from losing their jobs. Kellerman then asked to borrow Lewis gun so he could commit suicide, but Lewis refused to give it to him.\\nIn Season 7, Lewis developed problems with his new partner, Rene Sheppard, when she suffered a brutal beating and had her gun taken from her by a suspect, who shot at Lewis and nearly killed him the bullet nicked the crown of his trademark hat. Lewis refused to partner with any of the female detectives in the unit until the final episode, in which he and Sheppard achieved a reconciliation of sorts and began to work a crime scene together.\\nAccording to the Season 4 episode Ive Got a Secret, Lewis had a mentally ill brother named Anthony, who was institutionalized roughly 20 years earlier as he was a danger to himself and others. Lewis confessed to Kellerman that he did not intervene on one of Anthonys suicide attempts, and even briefly hoped it might succeed as it would end Anthonys suffering and the hardships he put on the rest of the family. Lewis estimated that he last visited Anthony in 1978; he tried to do so again during this episode, but Anthony refused to see him.\\nLewis had a harshly realistic view of the job, and was openly critical of Tim Bayliss for putting so much of his emotional energy into the unforgiving field of police work.\\nIn 1996, Lewis married Barbara Shivers on extremely short notice. The couple eventually split up. Those who knew Lewis were unsurprised at the breakup; in fact, up to the moment of the wedding many of his co-workers particularly John Munch assumed the engagement was a hoax.In October 2013, Lewis attended a roast for Munch in New York City following his retirement from the NYPD. Lewis jokingly told the audience that we Munchs former colleagues ran his butt outta B-more."

Moving to Texas, which at the time was part of Mexico, was particularly popular among debtors from the South and West.Emigrants or their abandoned neighbors often wrote the phrase on doors of abandoned houses or posted as a sign on fences.\\n\\nWhile speaking in Nacogdoches, Texas in early 1836, shortly before his death at The Alamo, Davy Crockett is quoted regarding his last campaign for Congress:\\n\\nA gentleman from Nacogdoches, in Texas, informs us, that, whilst there, he dined in public with col.

To satisfy your curiosity at once as to myself, I will tell you all about it. I was, for some years, a member of congress.

Portrayed by Indian actress Nimrat Kaur in season four 2014 and season eight 2020, Tasneem is an Inter-Services Intelligence ISI agent in Pakistan, and later the organizations Director-General.\\nKnown for her starring role in the 2013 film The Lunchbox, Kaur was cast as the season four nemesis of American Central Intelligence Agency CIA agent Carrie Mathison, the character played by series star Claire Danes. The role of Tasneem was Kaurs first time portraying a villain. She was surprised to be asked back for the shows final season, since the story had moved away from Pakistan after season four.\\nTasneem is introduced as a devious ISI agent who will do anything to advance the interests of the ISI and her secret Taliban allies, which may conflict with those of the CIA. She is presented as a villain, but showrunner Gansa explained that though Tasneem is ruthless, she has understandable motives and is only serving her country. In the final season, she has risen to leader of the ISI, a position which historically has always been held by a man in the real world. Tasneem comes into direct conflict with Carries mentor, US National Security Advisor Saul Berenson Mandy Patinkin, but becomes his reluctant ally as the interests of Pakistan and the US increasingly align.\\nIn season four, Tasneem blackmails the husband of the US ambassador to supply her with secret intelligence. Having already orchestrated the assassination of the CIA chief of station in Pakistan, Tasneem orders Sauls kidnapping by the Taliban, which prevents the new chief of station, Carrie, from capturing or killing Taliban commander Haissam Haqqani Numan Acar. Learning that Carrie has bipolar disorder, Tasneem tampers with her medication, hoping that Carries inevitable mental breakdown will get her out of Islamabad. Later, a convoy transporting Carrie and Saul is attacked, and Tasneem intentionally delays the dispatch of Pakistani military assistance. Meanwhile, Tasneem has passed along to Haqqani her discovery of a hidden tunnel into the US embassy, which he uses to invade the embassy.\\nIn season eight, Tasneem is now Director-General of the ISI, and Saul is the US National Security Advisor. Critical of US foreign policy, Tasneem is not supportive of Sauls efforts to broker peace between Afghanistan and the Taliban. Saul arranges a secret meeting in Pakistan with Haqqani, now leader of the Taliban, but Tasneem learns of it. She attempts to assassinate Haqqani and replace him with his son Jalal Elham Ehsas, but Haqqani survives. The deaths of the US president and Afghan president in a helicopter crash lead to the arrest of Haqqani, who Saul does not believe is responsible. Tasneem agrees to help Saul stall the trial, but they fail and Haqqani is executed. An empowered Jalal reinvigorates the Taliban and becomes a problem for Tasneem, who has lost the power to control him. Seeking to ease escalating tensions between the US and Pakistan, Tasneem provides Saul with intel to distract the trigger-happy new US president away from a potential invasion of Pakistan.\\nTasneem has been repeatedly called the character viewers love to hate, and Kaur has been praised for her performance."

Not all armed forces have such a rank, and in those that do the actual insignia of the five-star ranks may not contain five stars. For example: the insignia for the French OF-10 rank marchal de France contains seven stars; the insignia for the Portuguese marechal contains four gold stars. The stars used on the rank insignias of various Commonwealth of Nations are sometimes referred to colloquially as pips, but are stars of the orders of the Garter, Thistle or Bath or Eversleigh stars depending on the wearers original regiment or corps, and are used in combination with other heraldic items, such as batons, crowns, swords or maple leaves.\\nTypically, five-star officers hold the rank of general of the army, admiral of the fleet, field marshal, marshal or general of the air force, and several other similarly named ranks. As an active rank, the position exists only in a minority of countries and is usually held by only a very few officers during wartime. In times of peace, it is usually held only as an honorary rank. Traditionally, five-star ranks are granted to distinguished military commanders for notable wartime victories and/or in recognition of a record of achievement during the officers career, whether in peace or in war. Alternatively, a five-star rank or even higher ranks may be assumed by heads of state in their capacities as commanders-in-chief of their nations armed forces.\\nDespite the rarity and seniority of five-star officers, an even more-senior rank of general of the armies was adopted in the United States. Other names for highly senior ranks from the twentieth century include gnralissime France, generalissimo Spain and generalissimus USSR."

            "Assassination of Qasem Soleimani, On 3 January 2020, Qasem Soleimani, an Iranian major general, was killed by a U.S. drone strike at Baghdad International Airport. The drone targeted and killed Soleimani while he was on his way to meet Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi in Baghdad. Soleimani was commander of the Quds Force, one of five branches of Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps IRGC, and was considered the second most powerful person in Iran, subordinate to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Five Iraqi nationals and four other Iranian nationals were killed alongside Soleimani, including the deputy chairman of Iraqs Popular Mobilization Forces PMF and commander of the Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis a person designated as a terrorist by the U.S. and the United Arab Emirates UAE. The Pentagon says Soleimani and his troops were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more.The strike occurred during the 20192022 Persian Gulf crisis, which began after the U.S. withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran in 2018, reimposed sanctions, and accused Iranian elements of fomenting a campaign to harass U.S. forces in the region in 2019. On 27 December 2019, the K-1 Air Base in Iraq, which hosts Iraqi and U.S. personnel, was attacked, killing an American contractor. The U.S. responded by launching airstrikes across Iraq and Syria, reportedly killing 25 Kataib Hezbollah militiamen. Days later, Shia militiamen and their supporters retaliated by attacking the U.S. embassy in the Green Zone.\\nU.S. officials justified the Soleimani strike saying it was necessary to stop an imminent attack, though later clarifying the legal justification of the action as being taken in response to an escalating series of attacks.to protect United States personnel, to deter Iran from conducting or supporting further attacks.and to end Irans strategic escalation of attacks. Some experts, including the United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, considered the assassination as a likely violation of international law as well as U.S. domestic laws. Iran called the strike an act of state terrorism. The Iraqi government said the attack undermined its national sovereignty and considered it a breach of its bilateral security agreements with the U.S. and an act of aggression against its officials. On 5 January 2020, the Iraqi parliament passed a non-binding resolution to expel all foreign troops from its territory while, on the same day, Iran took the fifth and last step of reducing commitments to the 2015 international nuclear deal.\\nSoleimanis killing sharply escalated tensions between the U.S. and Iran. Iranian leaders vowed revenge, while U.S. officials said they would preemptively attack any Iran-backed paramilitary groups in Iraq that they perceived as a threat. Many in the international community reacted with concern and urged restraint and diplomacy. Five days after the airstrike, Iran launched a series of missile attacks on U.S. forces based in Iraq, the first known direct engagement between Iran and the U.S. since the naval battle precipitating the Vincennes incident on 3 July 1988. Following the shootdown of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 amidst the escalation, no additional actions took place."

AD 480550 for monks living communally under the authority of an abbot.\\n\\nThe spirit of Saint Benedicts Rule is summed up in the motto of the Benedictine Confederation: pax peace and the traditional ora et labora pray and work. Compared to other precepts, the Rule provides a moderate path between individual zeal and formulaic institutionalism; because of this middle ground it has been widely popular. Benedicts concerns were the needs of monks in a community environment: namely, to establish due order, to foster an understanding of the relational nature of human beings, and to provide a spiritual father to support and strengthen the individuals ascetic effort and the spiritual growth that is required for the fulfillment of the human vocation, theosis.\\nThe Rule of Saint Benedict has been used by Benedictines for 15 centuries, and thus St. Benedict is sometimes regarded as the founder of Western monasticism due to the reforming influence that his rules had on the then-current Catholic hierarchy. There is, however, no evidence to suggest that Benedict intended to found a religious order in the modern sense and it was not until the Late Middle Ages that mention was made of an Order of Saint Benedict. His Rule was written as a guide for individual, autonomous communities, and all Benedictine Houses and the Congregations in which they have grouped themselves still remain self-governing. Advantages seen in retaining this unique Benedictine emphasis on autonomy include cultivating models of tightly bonded communities and contemplative lifestyles. Perceived disadvantages comprise geographical isolation from important activities in adjacent communities. Other perceived losses include inefficiency and lack of mobility in the service of others, and insufficient appeal to potential members. These different emphases emerged within the framework of the Rule in the course of history and are to some extent present within the Benedictine Confederation and the Cistercian Orders of the Common and the Strict Observance.\\n\\n"

The game was released in North America later in 1990 and in European regions by Nintendo in 1992. Taking place after the events of Mega Man 2, the plot follows the titular hero as he helps his creator, Dr. Light, and a supposedly former enemy, Dr. Wily, collect parts for a peace-keeping robot by defeating several Robot Masters that have gone haywire.\\nAn action-platform game, Mega Man 3 follows the same format set forth by its two predecessors. The player, as Mega Man, must complete a series of stages in any order. Defeating a stages boss will earn the player its special weapon, which can be selected and used at will throughout the rest of the game. Mega Man 3 introduces new gameplay elements such as Mega Mans canine sidekick Rush and the ability to slide along the ground. Unlike the first two installments of the series, artist and designer Keiji Inafune has considered the creation of Mega Man 3 to be very stressful due to time constraints and his own increased responsibilities during its development.\\nFollowing the success of Mega Man 2 released two years earlier, Mega Man 3 has sold 1.17 million copies and has been positively received in critical reviews. Its presentation and gameplay has been especially praised, although many sources found the game to be too difficult. Like other titles in the series, Mega Man 3 has been re-released several times on other gaming platforms, on mobile phones, and as part of various Mega Man franchise compilations. A sequel, Mega Man 4, was released in 1991."

An unusual slapstick mix of film noir, black comedy, Hitchcockian suspense, B-movie and conventions, Crimewave portrays bizarre situations involving a nebbish everyman Birney entangled in a murderous plot while pursuing his love interest Wilson.\\nFollowing the commercial success of The Evil Dead 1981, Raimi and Campbell decided to collaborate on another project. Joel Coen of the Coen brothers served as one of the editors on The Evil Dead and worked with Raimi on the screenplay. Production was difficult for several members of the crew, and the production studio, Embassy Pictures, refused to allow Raimi to edit the film. Several arguments broke out during the shoot of the film due to continued interference by the studio.\\nThe film was a box-office flop and has since fallen into relative obscurity outside of fans of Campbell and Raimi. Few critics reviewed it upon release, though the little amount of critical attention it received was mostly negative. Several story and style elements found in Crimewave influenced later productions by Raimi, and its overall failure directly led to the inception of Evil Dead II 1987. Over time, the film has achieved the status of a minor cult film."

            "Binding and loosing, Binding and loosing is originally a Jewish Mishnaic phrase also mentioned in the New Testament, as well as in the Targum. In usage, to bind and to loose simply means to forbid by an indisputable authority and to permit by an indisputable authority. One example of this is Isaiah 58:56 which relates proper fasting to loosing the chains of injustice.The poseks had, by virtue of their ordination, the power of deciding disputes relating to Jewish law. Hence, the difference between the two main schools of thought in early classical Judaism were summed up by the phrase the school of Shammai binds; the school of Hillel looses. Theoretically, however, the authority of the poseks proceeded from the Sanhedrin, and there is therefore a Talmudic statement that there were three decisions made by the lower house of judgment the Sanhedrin to which the upper house of judgment the heavenly one gave its supreme sanction. The claim that whatsoever a disciple binds or looses on earth shall be bound or loosed in heaven, which the Gospel of Matthew attributes to Jesus, and is still used commonly today in prayer, an effective method on account to Christianity.This is also the meaning of the phrase when it is applied in the text to Simon Peter and the other apostles in particular when they are invested with the power to bind and loose by Christ.\\nThis also serves as the scriptural and traditional foundation for the Catholic Churchs conception of papal authority, stemming from such an investiture of St. Peter, since, according to Catholic doctrine, the Popes are the Successors of St. Peter."

Based on Alexey Pajitnovs Tetris, Atari Games version features the same gameplay as the computer editions of the game, as players must stack differently shaped falling blocks to form and eliminate horizontal lines from the playing field. The game features several difficulty levels and two-player simultaneous play.\\nIn 1989, Atari Games released a port of their arcade version under their Tengen label for the Nintendo Entertainment System, despite it not being licensed by Nintendo for the system. There were also issues with the publishing rights for Tetris, and after much legal wrangling, Nintendo itself ended up with the rights to publish console versions, leaving Atari with only the rights to arcade versions. As a result, the Tengen game was only on the shelf for four weeks before Atari was legally required to recall the game and destroy any remaining inventory of its NES version.\\nNintendo produced its own version for the NES as well as a version for the Game Boy. Both versions were commercially successful and Nintendo held the Tetris license for many years. With fewer than 100,000 copies known to exist, the Tengen release has since become a collectors item, due to its short time on the market. Various publications have since noted that Tengens Tetris was in some ways superior to the official NES release, especially since the Tengen game featured a two-player simultaneous mode not available in Nintendos version."

            "Adventure Time, Adventure Time is an American fantasy animated television series created by Pendleton Ward for Cartoon Network and distributed by Warner Bros. Domestic Television. The series follows the adventures of a boy named Finn Jeremy Shada and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake John DiMaggioa dog with the magical power to change size and shape at will. Finn and Jake live in the post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo, where they interact with Princess Bubblegum Hynden Walch, the Ice King Tom Kenny, Marceline Olivia Olson, BMO Niki Yang, and others. The series is based on a 2007 short film that aired on Nicktoons. After the short became a viral hit on the Internet, Nickelodeons executives passed on its option before Cartoon Network commissioned a full-length series from Fred Seibert and Ward, which was previewed on March 11, 2010. The same year, the series premiered on Cartoon Network on April 5, and ended its eight-year run on September 3, 2018.\\nThe series drew inspiration from a variety of sources, including the fantasy role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons and video games. It was produced using hand-drawn animation; action and dialogue for episodes are decided by storyboarding artists based on rough outlines. Because each episode took roughly eight to nine months to complete, multiple episodes were worked on concurrently. The cast members recorded their lines in group recordings, and the series regularly employed guest actors for minor and recurring characters. Each episode runs for about eleven minutes; pairs of episodes are often telecast to fill half-hour program slots. Cartoon Network announced that on September 29, 2016, the series would conclude in 2018, after the airing of its tenth season. The series finale aired on September 3, 2018, which was followed by the Distant Lands specials and the upcoming Fionna and Cake spin-off, which were released on HBO Max.\\nAdventure Time was a ratings success for Cartoon Network, with some of its episodes attracting over three million viewers, and despite being aimed primarily at children, the show has developed a following among teenagers and adults. Adventure Time has received universal acclaim from critics, with much praise geared towards its originality and worldbuilding. The show won eight Primetime Emmy Awards, a Peabody Award, three Annie Awards, two British Academy Childrens Awards, a Motion Picture Sound Editors Award, and a Kerrang! Award. The series has also been nominated for three Critics Choice Television Awards, two Annecy Festival Awards, a TCA Award, and a Sundance Film Festival Award, among others. Of the many comic book spin-offs based on the series, one received an Eisner Award and two Harvey Awards. The series has also spawned various forms of licensed merchandise, including books, video games and clothing.\\n\\n"

Goncharov was imagined by users on Tumblr as a joke, often with the tagline The greatest mafia movie ever made. It is usually described as a mafia film set in Naples, with the involvement of Martin Scorsese. Those discussing the film have devised a fictionalized cast list that includes Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, John Cazale, Gene Hackman, Cybill Shepherd and Harvey Keitel.\\nGoncharov initially originated when a Tumblr user posted a picture of a pair of boots that featured details suggesting the films existence in place of a brand label. This post was reblogged in August 2020 with the joking allusion that Goncharov was a real film; this reblog is generally regarded as the genesis of the meme. The meme went viral in November 2022, after a poster for Goncharov was created and shared online. This sparked an elaborate fiction of its narrative content and production, described in posts on Tumblr and elsewhere as if the film were real. Goncharov has inspired an online fandom, received significant coverage in the media, and garnered responses from notable individuals, including Scorsese, generally playing along with the meme."

The character debuted on-screen during the episode broadcast on 14 September 1990. Margaret is characterised as a college drop-out unsure about her future. She leaves her home town of Oldham to escape her ex-boyfriend, Kieran Andrew Shakos, and relocates to Liverpool. She takes a job working as a nanny for Max Steven Pinder and Patricia Farnham Gabrielle Glaister and becomes their lodger. Stephenson has described Margaret as a domestic and organised character but when it comes to romance she is confused and unstable.\\nWriters gave Stephenson a series of challenging storylines throughout her tenure, often involving taboo romances. In her first notable story, Margaret begins a relationship with a Catholic priest, Derek OFarrell Clive Moore. Their affair upsets various other characters, including Dereks sister, DD Dixon Irene Marot, who attempts to sabotage their happiness. The two break up when Derek moves to work in Bosnia. The story prompted both complaints and praise from various religious and casual viewers. Undeterred by the controversy Margaret had already caused, Brookside creator Phil Redmond and executive producer Mal Young created another taboo romance. This time Margaret befriends Beth Jordache Anna Friel who develops romantic feelings and this culminates in a kiss. It was the first time a same-sex kiss between two females had aired pre-watershed in the United Kingdom. The story caused controversy, made television history and set a standard for other shows to follow. The scene has gained iconic status in LGBT culture and British television history. It also became one of Brooksides defining moments. Stephenson has labelled Margaret a heterosexual but her involvement with Beth caused her confusion. Stephenson left the series in 1994 and writers created yet more drama to facilitate her departure. Margaret has an affair with a married man, Carl Banks Stephen Donald but ultimately leaves for Bosnia to reunite with Derek."

The premise of the series is that Buffy is a Slayer, a young girl endowed with superhuman powers to fight evil, which she accomplishes with the help of a small group of friends and family, called the Scooby Gang. During the shows second season, it becomes apparent that local authorities are aware of the endemic evil in the town, and either ignore it or are complicit in making it worse. The third season reveals that the Mayor is behind this conspiracy to hide and worsen Sunnydales supernatural phenomena, as part of his century-long plot to take over the world, making him the seasons primary villain, or Big Bad. His genial demeanor, promotion of family values, casual phobia of germs, and dislike of swearing belie his evil nature. The series regularly employs monsters and elements of horror to symbolize real problems, and the abuse of power in relation to the forces of darkness is a repeated theme throughout the series, as well as in its spin-off Angel.This season also marks Buffys and her friends last year in high school, and introduces a long-running character named Faith Eliza Dushku, who is also a Slayer. After many months of fighting alongside Buffy and being under the authority of Buffys Watcher, Giles, Faith becomes estranged from Buffy and aligns herself with the Mayor, who both employs her as an assassin and becomes a father figure to her while preparing to become a powerful demon that will destroy the town."

            "Nancy Wesley, Nancy Wesley is a fictional character from the American NBC soap opera Days of Our Lives, played by Patrika Darbo. Nancy was created when the serials producer Tom Langan wanted a real woman as opposed to a super-skinny actress to join the cast. Casting director Fran Bascom contacted Darbo with the offer and she accepted. Langan did not require the actress to audition for the role. Nancy is introduced as the wife of Craig Wesley Kevin Spirtas and is described as a loyal spouse. Langan liked the dynamic between the two characters; he believed that handsome Craig loved the not super-thin Nancy very much. Darbo has spoken about the characters sharing a mutual love and credits her own rapport with Spirtas to the characters popularity. Nancy has been featured in storylines involving breast cancer, a feud with Mike Horton Roark Critchlow, getting run over by a truck, and having a child to provide her leukemia stricken daughter, Chloe Lane Nadia Bjorlin with a bone marrow transplant. The character was also involved in a storyline that was part of a promotional campaign for food franchisor Mrs. Fields and charity Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.\\nThe character has been met with positive reviews. Mark Edward Wilows from the Post-Tribune reported that critics were raving about the pivotal role Nancy. Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times said that Nancy was the most notable celebration of larger-size females on daytime television. Larger female viewers have praised the character because they felt there was a place for themselves on television. For her portrayal of Nancy, Darbo has won a newcomer award at the Soap Opera Digest Awards and has been nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award."

It combines an action-adventure game with a relatively realistic first-person shooter and elements of a stealth game.\\nThe game is based on the works of H. P. Lovecraft, author of The Call of Cthulhu and progenitor of the Cthulhu Mythos. It is a reimagining of Lovecrafts 1936 novella The Shadow over Innsmouth, taking large inspiration from Chaosiums Call of Cthulhu role-playing game 1997 scenario Escape From Innsmouth. Set mostly in the year 1922, the story follows Jack Walters, a mentally unstable private detective hired to investigate in Innsmouth, a strange and mysterious town that has cut itself off from the rest of the United States.\\nIn development since 1999, the project was repeatedly delayed, going through several revisions and having some of its most ambitious and immersive features abandoned and the initially planned PlayStation 2 version cancelled. Although well received by critics, Dark Corners of the Earth was a commercial failure. At least two more Cthulhu Mythos games were planned by Headfirst Productions, including a direct sequel titled Call of Cthulhu: Destinys End, but neither were completed due to Headfirsts bankruptcy."

No one has yet proven who first used this phrase in print.\\n\\nWashington D.C. is not a place to live in. The rents are high, the food is bad, the dust is disgusting and the morals are deplorable. Go West, young man, go West and grow up with the country.\\nThe Oxford Dictionary of Quotations gives the full quotation as, Go West, young man, and grow up with the country, from Hints toward Reforms 1850 by Horace Greeley, but the phrase does not occur in that book.\\nIn 2010, Timothy Hughes of the Rare & Early Newspapers blog examined Greeleys writings and concluded that this text also does not appear in the July 13, 1865 issue of the Tribune: Here is the Tribune of that date and Ive scoured through the issue yet never found the quote. The closest I could come is in The Homestead Law article, page 4 column 4, where he mentioned: . We earnestly urge upon all such to turn their faces Westward and colonize the public lands . . See text image. The actual editorial instead encourages American Civil War veterans to take advantage of the Homestead Act and colonize the public lands.\\n\\nIn 1849, Samuel Merritt was making a name for himself as a physician in Plymouth, Mass. Merritt, originally from Harpswell, Maine, completed a difficult operation on a friend of the aging statesman Daniel Webster. Webster lived in nearby Marshfield at the time. Impressed, Webster befriended the young doctor. As they spoke, Merritt admitted his fascination with the gold rush drawing people to California. Webster advised him, Go out there, young man; go out there and behave yourself, and, free as you are from family cares, you will never regret it. Samuel took the advice. https://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/daniel-webster-tells-dr-samuel-merritt-go-west/\\nGreeley favored westward expansion. He saw the fertile farmland of the west as an ideal place for people willing to work hard for the opportunity to succeed. The phrase came to symbolize the idea that agriculture could solve many of the nations problems of poverty and unemployment characteristic of the big cities of the East. It is one of the most commonly quoted sayings from the nineteenth century and may have had some influence on the course of American history."

The game centers on former NYPD detective Max Payne, who attempts to solve the murder of his family while investigating a drug trafficking case involving a mysterious new designer drug called Valkyr. While doing so, Max becomes entangled in a large and complex conspiracy, involving a major pharmaceutical company, organized crime, a secret society, and the U.S. military. The game features a gritty neo-noir style and uses graphic novel panels with voice-overs as the primary means of telling the games story, drawing inspiration from hard-boiled detective novels by authors like Mickey Spillane. The game contains many allusions to Norse mythology, particularly the myth of Ragnark, and several of the names used in the game are allusions to Norse mythology. The gameplay is heavily influenced by the Hong Kong action cinema genre, particularly the work of director John Woo, and it was one of the first games to feature the bullet-time effect popularized by The Matrix.\\nMax Payne was originally released for Microsoft Windows in July 2001, and was later ported by Rockstar Games to the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in December 2001, and by MacSoft and Feral Interactive to the Mac OS in July 2002. A version of the game for the Game Boy Advance, featuring an isometric perspective but retaining most of the originals gameplay elements, was released by Rockstar in December 2003, and an enhanced port for mobile devices was published in 2012 to coincide with the release of Rockstars Max Payne 3. A Dreamcast version of the game was also planned, but was canceled due to the discontinuation of the console in 2001. Max Payne was also made available on Xbox 360 as part of Xbox Originals program in 2009, on PlayStation 3 as a PS2 Classic in 2012, on PlayStation 4 in 2016, and on Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S in 2021, due to consoles respective backward compatibility and emulation features.\\nThe original release of Max Payne received highly positive reviews for its exciting gunplay and use of noir storytelling devices, and has been cited as one of the best video games ever made. The game won a large number of accolades, including a BAFTA Award for Best PC Game of 2001. Its success launched the Max Payne franchise, including the sequels Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne, developed again by Remedy and published by Rockstar in October 2003, and Max Payne 3, developed solely by Rockstar and released in May 2012. A loose film adaptation of the first game was released in October 2008.

Described as a comical action game, the player controls the titular character, a bionic superhero with telescopic limbs, as he must defeat the villainous Dr. Bomb before he takes over the world. Bravoman can use his arms, legs and head to defeat enemies, and can also crouch and jump over them. The game ran on the Namco System 1 arcade board.\\nConceived by Namco composer Norio Nakagata, Bravoman is a homage to 1930s tokusatsu films, parodying common tropes found in the genre, and Nakagatas love for synthesizer music. Many former staff members from Toei Animation were hired for the project, leading to the games distinct art style influenced by anime. Bravomans real identity, known as Hitoshi Nakamura, is a caricature of Namcos then-president Masaya Nakamura, who the game was dedicated to. It is Namcos only video game to use pressure-sensitive buttons, which were reportedly easy to break. It was ported to a handful of systems, including the TurboGrafx-16, Japanese mobile phones, and the Wii Virtual Console.\\nIn Japan, Bravoman was widely successful, receiving high praise for its gameplay and humor. It received much more negative coverage from western publications, who disliked its mechanics, difficulty, and inferiority to other games in the genre. The game spawned a shooter spin-off, Pistol Daimyo no Boken, in 1990. Bravoman has since gained notoriety from its revival through the now-defunct ShiftyLook division of Namco Bandai Games, who produced a webcomic and animated series based on the game. ShiftyLook also produced an endless runner based on the comic, Bravoman: Binja Bash!, for cellular devices. A true sequel was in production towards the end of the 1980s, but was cancelled when the developers grew concerned that its concept would not work as a game."

The story follows Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy as they journey to stop Doctor Eggman from taking over the world. Controlling a character, players are tasked with completing each level, defeating Eggman and his robot army, and collecting the seven Chaos Emeralds.\\nDevelopment began after Sega shifted its focus to third-party software development, due to the poor performance of the Dreamcast console. Sega recruited Dimps to lead development, making the game the first in the franchise developed by the studio. While Sonic Advance follows a similar style of gameplay to the Sega Genesis Sonic games, certain concepts and designs were reused from newer games such as Sonic Adventure 1998. The game has been ported to Nokias N-Gage and Android devices, and is available on the Wii U via the Virtual Console in Japan.\\nSonic Advance received positive reviews for its graphics, character animations, and faithfulness to the original Genesis games, but was criticized for its short length and special stages. It was a major commercial success, selling 1.21 million copies in the United States and is among the GBAs bestselling games. The game was followed by two sequels also on the Game Boy Advance; Sonic Advance 2 2002 and Sonic Advance 3 2004."

Despite the game only being released in Japan, it grew a cult following in the West due to its exaggerated themes of American patriotism.

            "Gilgai, A gilgai is a small, ephemeral lake formed from a depression in the soil surface in expanding clay soils. Additionally, the term gilgai is used to refer to the overall micro-relief in such areas, consisting of mounds and depressions, not just the lakes themselves. The name comes from an Australian Aboriginal word meaning small water hole. These pools are commonly a few metres across and less than 30 cm 12 in deep, however in some instances they may be several metres deep and up to 100 m 330 ft across. Gilgais are found worldwide wherever cracking clay soils and pronounced wet and dry seasons are present. Gilgais are also called melonholes, crabholes, hogwallows or puff and shelf formations.\\n\\nGilgais are thought to form in vertisols through repeated cycles of swelling of the clay when wet and subsequent shrinkage upon drying. This action, known as argillipedoturbation, causes the soil to crack when dry and loose soil material then fills these cracks. When the soil swells upon subsequent re-wetting the soil pressure cannot be dispersed into the now-full cracks and the soil is forced sideways causing a mound to form between cracks and a depression to form at the location of the crack. The process is then further exaggerated by the depressions holding water and thus becoming wetter and swelling more than the mounds, causing even greater shrinkage and cracking. In addition, the cracks channel water deeply into the soil causing even greater swelling and subsequent cracking of the depression areas. Each cycle of swelling, shrinkage and cracking becomes more exaggerated and the landscape eventually becomes covered by a repeated pattern of mounds and depressions. The depressions hold surface water during the wet seasons.\\nAustralia has an abundance of cracking clay soils and a large areas dominated by very pronounced wet and dry seasons providing ideal circumstances for the formation of gilgais. Areas outside Australia that also have the necessary conditions for gilgai formation include central Russia and several parts of the United States, including South Dakota and Texas. Gilgais are structurally similar to the patterned ground of frigid regions, however periglacial soil polygons are formed by repeated freeze-thaw cycles rather than the soil moisture cycles that create gilgai.\\nGilgais were an important source of water for Indigenous Australians and enabled people to seasonally forage over areas that lacked permanent water. Similarly, they allowed the stock of early Australian pastoralists to seasonally graze these areas. The introduction of water wells and pumps has reduced the value of gilgais to humans as a source of water. Gilgais are now generally considered a nuisance by farmers. The movement of soil associated with gilgai formation damages infrastructure including building foundations, roads and railway lines and the undulations produced interfere with crop harvesting. The presence of seasonal water in grazing land makes it more difficult to control stock and provides a water supply for vermin such as feral pigs and kangaroos.\\nGilgais remain of great ecological significance as a source of water for animal and plant life. Crayfish burrow in the wet basins and ants build up the mounds, magnifying the formations through bioturbation."

American poet Marc Smith, believing the poetry scene at the time was too structured and stuffy, began experimenting by attending open-microphone poetry readings, and then turning them into slams by introducing the element of competition.The performances at a poetry slam are judged as much on enthusiasm and style as content, and poets may compete as individuals or in teams. The judging is often handled by a panel of judges, typically five, who are usually selected from the audience. Sometimes the poets are judged by audience response."

Its website stated in 2015 that it had released online 10 million documents since beginning in 2006 in Iceland. Julian Assange, an Australian Internet activist, is generally described as its founder and director and is currently fighting extradition to the United States over his work with WikiLeaks. Since September 2018, Kristinn Hrafnsson has served as its editor-in-chief.The group has released a number of prominent document caches that exposed serious violations of human rights and civil liberties to the US and international public, including the Collateral Murder footage from the 12 July 2007 Baghdad airstrike in which Iraqi Reuters journalists were among several civilians killed. WikiLeaks is known for publishing leaks such as diplomatic cables from the United States and Saudi Arabia, emails from the governments of Syria and Turkey, corruption in Kenya and at Samherji, a multinational fishing company based in Iceland. WikiLeaks has also published documents exposing surveillance by the Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency and private corporations. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign, WikiLeaks released emails from the Democratic National Committee and from Hillary Clintons campaign manager, showing that the partys national committee favoured Clinton over her rival Bernie Sanders in the primaries. These releases resulted in the resignation of Debbie Wasserman Schultz as chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee DNC and caused significant harm to the Clinton campaign. They have been cited as a possible contributing factor in Clintons loss to Donald Trump in the presidential election. During the campaign, WikiLeaks promoted conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party and the murder of Seth Rich.WikiLeaks has won a number of awards and has been commended for exposing state and corporate secrets, increasing transparency, assisting freedom of the press, and enhancing democratic discourse while challenging powerful institutions. WikiLeaks and some of its supporters say the organisations publications have a perfect authenticity record. The group has been the target of campaigns to discredit it, including aborted ones by Palantir and HBGary. WikiLeaks has also had its donation systems disrupted by problems with its payment processors. As a result, the Wau Holland Foundation helps process WikiLeaks donations.\\n\\nThe organisation has been criticised for inadequately curating its content and violating the personal privacy of individuals. WikiLeaks has, for instance, revealed Social Security numbers, medical information, credit card numbers and details of suicide attempts. Various news organisations, activists, journalists and former members have also criticised the organisation over allegations of anti-semitism, an anti-Clinton and pro-Trump bias, various associations with the Russian government, a history of buying and selling leaks, and a lack of internal transparency. Journalists have also criticised the group for promoting false flag conspiracy theories, and its exaggerated and misleading descriptions of the contents of leaks. The CIA defined the group as a non-state hostile intelligence service after the release of Vault 7."

Since 2007, Nev has starred in his own CBBC show Bear Behaving Badly, alongside Barney Harwood. His name was created from the name of his co-star Dev Griffin on Smile. He was last seen on Hacker Time when Derek puts Nev on Line 1 for Barney Harwood. Nev has patches in places on his body and is missing part of his ear. This is due to Bandit the cat, who is seen in some episodes of Bear Behaving Badly, trying to eat him. Nev often has trouble with pronunciation of certain words, he cannot sing but he can rap well. \\nNev likes ice cream, jam, dressing up, sleeping in and his snuggly ducky duck duck. When scared or intimidated, he growls, just like a real bear would. Originally on Smile, the voice of Nev was prerecorded with his limited vocabulary being played in as appropriate. When Nev took on a more significant role in Smile, puppeteer Ross Mullan, who also stars in Bear Behaving Badly, was recruited to provide the voice live. \\nOn 28 December 2007, Nev appeared on a puppet special of The Weakest Link hosted by Anne Robinson and broadcast on BBC One, but was eliminated in the fourth round of play, and as hinted in his post-elimination interview, he has a crush on both Soo and host Anne Robinson. In 2004, a soft plush Nev was released, but was only available in a few stores. \\nIn 2005, a talking Nev was released, speaking a number of catch phrases including Fwightened and No no no no. A complaint was made against the toy with regard to the word Quick, by an individual who believed she had heard a similar-sounding profanity instead. A smaller version of the soft toy has since been released."

            "Murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner, The murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner, also known as the Freedom Summer murders, the Mississippi civil rights workers murders, or the Mississippi Burning murders, refers to events in which three activists were abducted and murdered in the city of Philadelphia, Mississippi, in June 1964 during the Civil Rights Movement. The victims were James Chaney from Meridian, Mississippi, and Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner from New York City. All three were associated with the Council of Federated Organizations COFO and its member organization, the Congress of Racial Equality CORE. They had been working with the Freedom Summer campaign by attempting to register African Americans in Mississippi to vote. Since 1890 and through the turn of the century, southern states had systematically disenfranchised most black voters by discrimination in voter registration and voting.\\nThe three men had traveled from Meridian to the community of Longdale to talk with congregation members at a black church that had been burned; the church had been a center of community organization. The trio was arrested following a traffic stop for speeding outside Philadelphia, Mississippi, escorted to the local jail, and held for a number of hours. As the three left town in their car, they were followed by law enforcement and others. Before leaving Neshoba County, their car was pulled over. The three were abducted, driven to another location, and shot to death at close range. The bodies of the three men were taken to an earthen dam where they were buried.The disappearance of the three men was initially investigated as a missing persons case. The civil rights workers burnt-out car was found near a swamp three days after their disappearance. An extensive search of the area was conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI, local and state authorities, and four hundred United States Navy sailors. Their bodies were not discovered until seven weeks later, when the team received a tip. During the investigation it emerged that members of the local White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, the Neshoba County Sheriffs Office, and the Philadelphia Police Department were involved in the incident.The murder of the activists sparked national outrage and an extensive federal investigation, filed as Mississippi Burning MIBURN, which later became the title of a 1988 film loosely based on the events. In 1967, after the state government refused to prosecute, the United States federal government charged eighteen individuals with civil rights violations. Seven were convicted and received relatively minor sentences for their actions. Outrage over the activists disappearances helped gain passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\\nThe trio were shot and murdered by the Ku Klux Klan because Chaney was African-American and Goodman and Schwerner were both Jewish.\\nForty-one years after the murders took place, one perpetrator, Edgar Ray Killen, was charged by the state of Mississippi for his part in the crimes. In 2005 he was convicted of three counts of manslaughter and was given a 60-year sentence. On June 20, 2016, federal and state authorities officially closed the case, ending the possibility of further prosecution. Killen died in prison in January 2018."

He argued that, instead, Its better to create an ecology that gets all the worlds smartest people toiling in your garden for your goals. If you rely solely on your own employees, youll never solve all your customers needs. Core to this principle is the definition of smart within the context of the quotation.

            "Petrica Kerempuh, Petrica Kerempuh is a literary character who appears in a number of Croatian and former Yugoslav works, but is most famous for his appearance in the critically lauded The Ballads of Petrica Kerempuh by Croatian author Miroslav Krlea, who wrote in the Kajkavian dialect. Petrica Kerempuh is a prophet of the people and a cynical commentator on contemporary events.The name is derived from the dialectical word kerempuh, meaning belly or abdomen, with a figurative meaning suggesting a person of cunning or a merrymaker. The earliest origins appear to be from Jakob Lovrenis printing of the book Petrica Kerempuh iliti ini i ivljenje loveka prokenoga Petrica Kerempuh or the Life of a Prodigal Man in 1834, which is a translation of a German book on the travels and adventures of Till Eulenspiegel. In 1936, Krlea published The Ballads of Petrica Kerempuh in Ljubljana and it was received very well. The book went on to be considered an important moment in 20th-century Central European literature, emblematic of the best the region had to offer. Through the character, Krlea voiced his opposition to the centuries-old oppression of the people. Kerempuh is often considered to be a Zagorje version of the original Till Eulenspiegel tales, as well as the Hungarian tales of Mtys Garaboncis Dik, which was worked on by Titu Brezovaki.\\nAnother example of the character appears in Dragutin Domjanis little-known puppet game Petrica Kerempuh i spametni osel Petrica Kerempuh and the Smart Ass, in which he critically and satirically describes Croatian intellectuals of the 1920s. Apart from being a literary character, Petrica Kerempuh has also come to life in the theater. There is a sculpture of Petrica Kerempuh by the sculptor Vanja Radau, erected in 1955, located at the Dolac Market in Zagreb. North of Dolac is Petrica Kerempuhs Square, where flowers are sold."

It is a reboot of Nintendos Donkey Kong franchise and follows the gorilla Donkey Kong and his nephew Diddy Kong as they set out to recover their stolen banana hoard from the crocodile King K. Rool and his army, the Kremlings. The single-player traverses 40 side-scrolling levels as they jump between platforms and avoid obstacles. They collect items, ride minecarts and animals, defeat enemies and bosses, and find secret bonus stages. In multiplayer modes, two players work cooperatively or race each other.\\nAfter developing Nintendo Entertainment System games in the 1980s, Rare, a British studio founded by Tim and Chris Stamper, purchased Silicon Graphics workstations to render 3D models. Nintendo sought a game to compete with Segas Aladdin 1993 and commissioned Rare to revive the dormant Donkey Kong franchise. Rare assembled 12 developers to work on Donkey Kong Country over 18 months. Donkey Kong Country was inspired by the Super Mario series and was one of the first home console games to feature pre-rendered graphics, achieved through a compression technique that allowed Rare to convert 3D models into SNES sprites with little loss of detail. It was the first Donkey Kong game neither produced nor directed by the series creator Shigeru Miyamoto, though he contributed design ideas.\\nFollowing its announcement at the Consumer Electronics Show in June 1994, Donkey Kong Country was highly anticipated and backed by a major marketing campaign that cost $16 million in America alone. It was released in November 1994 to acclaim; critics hailed its visuals as groundbreaking and praised its gameplay and music. Its quality and design were favourably compared to the Super Mario series. Donkey Kong Country received several year-end accolades and set the record for the fastest-selling video game at the time. With 9.3 million copies sold worldwide, it is the third-bestselling SNES game and the bestselling Donkey Kong game. Following the success, Nintendo purchased a large minority stake in Rare, which became a prominent second-party developer for Nintendo during the late 1990s.\\nDonkey Kong Country re-established Donkey Kong as a popular Nintendo franchise and is credited for helping Nintendo win the console war of the 1990s and maintaining the SNESs popularity into the fifth generation of video game consoles. It is considered one of the greatest video games of all time and has been ported to platforms such as the Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, and digital distribution services. Rare followed it with two sequels for the SNES, Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddys Kong Quest 1995 and Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kongs Double Trouble! 1996, and the Nintendo 64 game Donkey Kong 64 1999. After a hiatus, during which Rare was acquired by the Nintendo competitor Microsoft, Retro Studios revived the series with Donkey Kong Country Returns 2010 for the Wii and Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze 2014 for the Wii U."

Music that was popularized by MTV in the early 1980s and the nostalgia behind it is a major driver to the format. It is considered the successor to the oldies format, a collection of top 40 songs from the late 1950s through the late 1970s that was once extremely popular in the United States and Canada. The term is sometimes incorrectly used as a synonym for the adult hits format, which uses a slightly newer music library stretching from all decades to the present with a major focus on 1990s and 2000s pop, rock and alternative songs. In addition, adult hits stations tend to have larger playlists, playing a given song only a few times per week, compared to the tighter libraries on classic hits stations. For example, KRTH, a classic hits station in Los Angeles, and KLUV, a classic hits station in Dallas, both play power songs up to 30 times a week or more, which is another differentiator compared to other formats that share songs with classic hits libraries.\\nThe classic hits format has become extremely popular in the last few years with stations like KRTH, WCBS-FM in New York, WLS-FM in Chicago, and WROR-FM in Boston, having successful ratings with this model. Classic hits was named format of the summer of 2018 by Nielsen Audios research team emphasizing the huge popularity of the format. In addition, the Millennial generation is listening to this format in record numbers, according to a Nielsen report. As of December 2019 there are now over 1,100 classic hits stations in the United States, the largest amount in format history."

The game was later ported to the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable PSP with the adult content removed. The Windows version was released in English by MangaGamer in 2012. The story follows the life of Mizuho Miyanokouji, an androgynous male high school student, who transfers into an all-girls school due to his grandfathers will.\\nThe gameplay in Otoboku follows a branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the six female main characters by the player character. The game ranked as the second best-selling PC game sold in Japan for the time of its release, and charted in the national top 50 several more times afterwards. Caramel Box went on to produce two fan discs released in 2005 and 2007 in Caramel Box Yarukibako and Caramel Box Yarukibako 2, respectively. Caramel Box later produced a sequel to Otoboku titled Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru: Futari no Elder, released on June 30, 2010 playable on Windows PCs. Futari no Elder was ported to the PSP with the adult content removed. The story follows Chihaya Kisakinomiya, an androgynous male, who transfers into the all-girls school that was the setting of Otoboku.

The Otoboku anime was generally panned in reviews at Anime News Network where the series was described as cruelly unimaginative with obnoxious quirks and technical shortcomings. In a review of the anime by Mania Entertainment, the series is thought to be very predictable and bland. A three-episode OVA adaptation of Futari no Elder produced by Silver Link was released between August and October 2012. An OVA adaptation of Trinkle Stars produced by EXNOA with animation by Blue Bread was released in January 2022."

            "Sweep puppet, Sweep is a British puppet and television character popular in the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and other countries.\\nSweep is a grey glove puppet dog with long black ears who joined The Sooty Show in 1957, as a friend to fellow puppet Sooty. He is a smart dog but chooses to be dim-witted with a penchant for bones and sausages. Sweep is notable for his method of communication which consists of a loud high-pitched squeak that gains its inflection from normal speech and its rhythm from the syllables in each word.\\nThe rest of the cast, namely Soo and the presenter, could understand Sweep perfectly, and would albeit indirectly translate for the viewer. The sound of Sweeps voice was achieved using a saxophone reed. Versions of the puppet later sold as toys had an integral squeaker connected to an air bulb that was squeezed by hand.\\nSweeps family first appeared on the Sooty Show in an episode called Sweeps Family. He has his mother and father, a twin brother Swoop, two cousins Swipe and Swap and another seven brothers in the litter all of whom look exactly like him, except that they each wear different coloured collars to tell each other apart. However Swipe and Swap are stated to be Sweeps brothers in the Sooty & Co. episode Sweeps Family and the Sooty Heights episode the Hounds of Music."

            "Kim Fox, Kim Fox also Fox-Hubbard is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Tameka Empson. She is the half-sister of Denise Fox Diane Parish, and aunt to Chelsea Fox Tiana Benjamin/Zaraah Abrahams and Libby Fox Belinda Owusu. She first appeared as a guest character on 24 November 2009, and was reintroduced in 2010 as a regular character after piquing the interest of new executive producer Bryan Kirkwood. Empson took maternity leave in October 2013 and after appearing several times during her break via webcam, Kim returned to Albert Square on 30 December 2014. It was announced on 16 July 2019 that Empson would be taking a break from the show but will return at some point in the future. She departed on 23 July 2019. Kim made a special appearance via webcam on 25 December 2019. Empson returned following her maternity break in the episode broadcast on 16 November 2020.\\nKim is described as viscous and bubbly on the outside, but hiding vulnerability and low self-esteem. The EastEnders website describes Kim as having big hair, a loud personality, hyperactive and a big heart. She is sharp, family-orientated and cares about her appearance, having a loud dress sense and being the life and soul of any party. She chooses the wrong men to have relationships with, but knows what she wants when it comes to love. Kim makes her first appearance for Denises wedding to Lucas Johnson Don Gilet. She briefly returns after Denise is presumed dead, but makes a more permanent return when she separates from her boyfriend Dexter Mulholland Robbie Gee. Kim kisses Ricky Butcher Sid Owen, sparking a brief feud with his wife, Bianca Patsy Palmer. She establishes a short-lived speakeasy and later opens a bed and breakfast. Kim also goes through a HIV scare and has a relationship with Ray Dixon Chucky Venn. Kim gave birth to a baby girl, Pearl, prematurely during EastEnders Live Week, which celebrated EastEnders 30th anniversary. In later storylines, Kim has suffered a miscarriage and had to cope with becoming a single mother to her and Vincent Hubbards Richard Blackwood children, Pearl and Mica, following Vincents mysterious disappearance in April 2018.\\nKim is often shown in a comedic light and as a result, Empson earned a nomination for Best Comedy Performance at the 2011 British Soap Awards. That same year she won the Funniest Performance award at the Inside Soap Awards and again the following year. Ruth Deller from entertainment website Lowculture praised the character during her guest appearance in 2009 and later said Kim is a big, ballsy, whirlwind, who provides some light relief to the show. Daniel Maier from The Guardian has criticised Kims B&B venture, calling it a holding pen for characters who are between homes within Albert Squares hermetically sealed biosphere."

It reflects on the temporary nature, or ephemerality, of the human condition that neither the bad, nor good, moments in life ever indefinitely last. The general sentiment is often expressed in wisdom literature throughout history and across cultures, but the specific phrase seems to have originated in the writings of the medieval Persian Sufi poets.\\nIt is known in the Western world primarily due to a 19th-century retelling of Persian fable by the English poet Edward FitzGerald. It was also notably employed in a speech by Abraham Lincoln before he became the sixteenth President of the United States."

In particular, it refers to policies imposed by an internet service provider in order to limit customers usage of their services; typically, exceeding a data cap would require the subscriber to pay additional fees based on whether they have exceeded this limit. Implementation of a data cap is sometimes termed a fair access policy, fair usage policy, or usage-based billing by ISPs.U.S. ISPs have asserted that data caps are required in order to provide a fair service to their respective subscribers. The use of data caps has been criticized for becoming increasingly unnecessary, as decreasing infrastructure costs have made it cheaper for ISPs to increase the capacity of their networks to keep up with the demands of their users, rather than place arbitrary limits on usage. It has also been asserted that data caps are meant to help protect pay television providers that may also be owned by an ISP from competition with over-the-top streaming services.\\nAlthough often referred to as a bandwidth cap, it is not the actual bandwidth bits per second that is limited, but the total amount of data downloaded per month."

            "Trout Mask Replica, Trout Mask Replica is the third studio album by the American band Captain Beefheart and his Magic Band, released as a double album on June 16, 1969, by Straight Records. The music was composed by Captain Beefheart Don Van Vliet and arranged by drummer John Drumbo French. Combining elements of R&B, garage rock, and blues with free jazz and avant-garde composition, the album is regarded as an important work of experimental rock. Its unconventional musical style, which includes polyrhythm, multi-octave vocals, and polytonality, has given the album a reputation as one of the most challenging recordings in the 20th century musical canon. \\nThe album was produced by Frank Zappa and recorded in March 1969 at Whitney Studios in Glendale, California, following eight months of intense rehearsals at a small rented communal house in Los Angeles. The lineup of the Magic Band at this time consisted of Bill Zoot Horn Rollo Harkleroad and Jeff Antennae Jimmy Semens Cotton on guitar, Mark Rockette Morton Boston on bass guitar, Victor The Mascara Snake Hayden on bass clarinet, and John Drumbo French on drums and percussion. Beefheart played several brass and woodwind instruments, including saxophone, musette, and natural horn, and contributed most of the vocal parts, while Zappa and members of the band provided occasional vocals and narration. The well-rehearsed Magic Band recorded all instrumental tracks for the album in a single six-hour recording session; Beefhearts vocal and horn tracks were laid down over the next few days.\\nTrout Mask Replica sold poorly upon its initial release in the United States, where it failed to appear in any charts. It was more successful in the United Kingdom, where it spent a week at number 21 on the UK Albums Chart. In recent years, however, Trout Mask Replica has been widely regarded as the masterpiece of Beefhearts musical career, as well as an important influence on many subsequent artists. It was ranked number 60 on Rolling Stones 2012 edition of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list, and has appeared on the best of lists of many other publications."

Almost immediately after the games release, Sega published an updated version titled Galaxy Force II which added two new levels and other minor additions.\\nGalaxy Force was critically acclaimed, being praised for its graphics, gameplay, presentation, music and hardware capabilities, considered to be visually impressive for the time period. It was ported to several platforms, including the Master System, Sega Mega Drive/Genesis and Commodore 64, as well as being released under several different Sega classic game re-release labels such as Sega Ages.

In some tellings the creature has elongated fingernails, and green, slimy skin.The Qallupilluit were the subject of the book A Promise Is A Promise by Robert Munsch and Michael Kusugak.

The concept has been present in science fiction for almost a century and became widespread in the 1960s. Real jet packs have been developed using a variety of mechanisms, but their uses are much more limited than their fictional counterparts because of the challenges of the Earths atmosphere, gravity, the low energy density of utilisable fuels, and the human body not being suited to flight, and they are principally used for stunts. A practical use for the jet pack has been in extra-vehicular activities for astronauts because of the apparent weightlessness and lack of friction-creating atmosphere in orbit. The term jet suit is used for a system incorporating a jet pack and associated jets attached to the arms to increase manoeuvrability e.g. the Daedalus Flight Pack."

            "Planets in astrology, In astrology, planets have a meaning different from the astronomical understanding of what a planet is. Before the age of telescopes, the night sky was thought to consist of two very similar components: fixed stars, which remained motionless in relation to each other, and moving objects/wandering stars Ancient Greek: , romanized: asteres planetai, which moved relative to the fixed stars over the course of the years.\\nTo the Ancient Greeks who learned from the Babylonians - the earliest astronomers/astrologers - this group consisted of the five planets visible to the naked eye and excluded Earth, plus the Sun and Moon. Although the Greek term planet applied mostly to the five wandering stars, the Ancients included the Sun and Moon as the Sacred 7 Luminaires/7 Heavens sometimes referred to as Lights, making a total of 7 planets. The ancient Babylonians, Greeks, Persians, Romans and others thought of the 7 Classical Planets as gods and named their 7 days of the week after them. Astrologers retain this definition of the 7 Classical Planets today.\\nTo ancient astrologers, the planets represented the will of the deities and their direct influence upon human affairs. To modern astrologers, the planets can represent basic drives or urges in the subconscious, or energy flow regulators representing dimensions of experience. They express themselves with different qualities in the 12 signs of the zodiac and in the 12 houses. The planets are also related to each other in the form of aspects.\\nModern astrologers differ on the source of the correlations between planetary positions and configurations, on the one hand, and characteristics and destinies of the natives, on the other. Hone writes that the planets exert it directly through gravitation or another, unknown influence. Others hold that the planets have no direct influence in themselves, but are mirrors of basic organizing principles in the universe. In other words, the basic patterns of the universe repeat themselves everywhere, in fractal-like fashion, and As Above, So Below. Therefore, the patterns that the planets make in the sky reflect the ebb and flow of basic human impulses. The planets are also associated, especially in the Chinese tradition, with the basic forces of nature.\\nListed below are the specific meanings and domains associated with the astrological planets since ancient times, with the main focus on the Western astrological tradition. The planets in Hindu astrology are known as the Navagraha literally nine planets, with the addition of two shadow bodies Rahu and Ketu. In Chinese astrology, the planets are associated with the life forces of Yin & Yang and the five elements, which play an important role in the Chinese form of geomancy known as Feng Shui. Astrologers differ on the signs associated with each planets exaltation.\\n\\n"

The film was directed by George Roy Hill, who had directed Newman and Redford in the western Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Created by screenwriter David S. Ward, the story was inspired by real-life cons perpetrated by brothers Fred and Charley Gondorff and documented by David Maurer in his 1940 book The Big Con: The Story of the Confidence Man.\\nThe title phrase refers to the moment when a con artist finishes the play and takes the marks money. If a con is successful, the mark does not realize he has been cheated until the con men are long gone, if at all. The film is played out in distinct sections with old-fashioned title cards drawn by artist Jaroslav Jerry Gebr, the lettering and illustrations rendered in a style reminiscent of the Saturday Evening Post. The film is noted for its anachronistic use of ragtime, particularly the melody The Entertainer by Scott Joplin, which was adapted along with others by Joplin for the film by Marvin Hamlisch and a top-ten chart single for Hamlisch when released as a single from the films soundtrack. The films success created a resurgence of interest in Joplins work.Released on Christmas Day of 1973, The Sting was a massive critical and commercial success and was hugely successful at the 46th Academy Awards, being nominated for ten Oscars and winning seven, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Film Editing and Best Writing Original Screenplay; Redford was also nominated for Best Actor. The film also rekindled Newmans career after a series of big screen flops. Regarded as having one of the best screenplays ever written, in 2005, The Sting was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry of the Library of Congress as being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."

As of 2015, the price had already reached about 14 billion US dollars.Rocks law can be seen as the economic flip side to Moores first law that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles every two years. The latter is a direct consequence of the ongoing growth of the capital-intensive semiconductor industry innovative and popular products mean more profits, meaning more capital available to invest in ever higher levels of large-scale integration, which in turn leads to the creation of even more innovative products.\\nThe semiconductor industry has always been extremely capital-intensive, with ever-dropping manufacturing unit costs. Thus, the ultimate limits to growth of the industry will constrain the maximum amount of capital that can be invested in new products; at some point, Rocks Law will collide with Moores Law.It has been suggested that fabrication plant costs have not increased as quickly as predicted by Rocks law indeed plateauing in the late 1990s and also that the fabrication plant cost per transistor which has shown a pronounced downward trend may be more relevant as a constraint on Moores Law."

Milligan was later asked back every couple of months to do a few weeks filming. After eighteen months of playing Kyle on a part-time basis, Milligan was given a full-time contract deal and he and his character were promoted to the regular cast. Milligan said he was ecstatic about his promotion and looked forward to developing his character further. In August 2011, Milligan had to be written out of Neighbours temporarily so he could recover from an injury he sustained off screen. \\nKyle was initially portrayed as an immature bad boy, whose physical presence made him fall into the role of a bully. However, his low academic intelligence made him vulnerable to people smarter than himself. A traumatic accident and his struggle to secure employment changed Kyles ways. The character has been described as a larrikin, good hearted and laid back. Following his promotion to the regular cast, the shows writers gave Kyle some character traits similar to Henry Ramsay Craig McLachlan. Like Henry, Kyle becomes the handyman of Ramsay Street and he later opens his own business, which brings him into contact with many of the streets residents.\\nKyles storylines have often focused on his various relationships and jobs. Kyle engaged in a brief relationship with Natasha Williams Valentina Novakovic and developed a crush on Kate Ramsay Ashleigh Brewer. He later entered into a casual relationship with Jade Mitchell Gemma Pranita, which turned serious. Following Jades departure, Kyle began dating Georgia Brooks Saskia Hampele and they later married. Other storylines for Kyle have seen him blackmailed by a corrupt police officer and temporarily damaging his eyesight by looking at the sun during an eclipse. Milligan chose to leave Neighbours in 2015 and Kyle departed on 8 April 2016 with Georgia. He made a brief return from 15 to 20 September 2016, and returned to the cast full-time on 2 April 2019.

One fundamental problem is that it is often unclear when the war is over. Simon Jenkins, Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, said that Never, ever, should a government use war as a metaphor in a time of peace.The Cultural Revolution in China 19661976, which initially was launched as a War against Revisionism, is a discouraging example of a metaphorical war against -isms."

The term has been explored in post-structuralism as that which inherently disturbs conventional identity and cultural concepts. Julia Kristeva explored an influential and formative overview of the concept in her 1980 work Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection, where she describes subjective horror abjection as the feeling when an individual experiences or is confronted by the sheer experience of what Kristeva calls ones typically repressed corporeal reality, or an intrusion of the Real in the Symbolic Order.Kristevas concept of abjection is used commonly to analyze popular cultural narratives of horror, and discriminatory behavior manifesting in misogyny, homophobia and genocide. The concept of abjection builds on the traditional psychoanalytic theories of Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan, whose studies often narrowed in on the experience of the disintegration of personal distinctions, through neurosis in Freud and psychosis in Lacan."

Its dimensions and markings are defined by Law 1 of the Laws of the Game, The Field of Play. The pitch is typically made of natural turf or artificial turf, although amateur and recreational teams often play on dirt fields. Artificial surfaces are allowed only to be green in colour.\\nAll line markings on the pitch form part of the area which they define. For example, a ball on or above the touchline is still on the field of play, and a foul committed over the line bounding the penalty area results in a penalty. Therefore, a ball has to completely cross the touchline to be out of play, and a ball has to wholly cross the goal line between the goal posts in order for a goal to be scored; if any part of the ball is still on or above the line, a goal is not scored and the ball is still in play.\\nThe field descriptions that apply to adult matches are described below. Because of the role of the British football associations in the history of the game, the dimensions of the field of play were originally formulated and expressed in imperial units. Since 1997, the Laws of the Game have preferred metric units, with imperial equivalents given only in brackets. Because the actual values have, in general, not changed since the early twentieth century, they tend to be round numbers in imperial units for example the width of the goal, unchanged since 1863, is 8 yards or 7.32 metres. Use of the imperial values remains common, especially in the United Kingdom."

The coast is formed by the Arabian Sea on the southeast, and the Gulf of Oman on the northeast. The Madha and Musandam exclaves are surrounded by the United Arab Emirates on their land borders, with the Strait of Hormuz which it shares with Iran and the Gulf of Oman forming Musandams coastal boundaries. Muscat is the nations capital and largest city.\\nFrom the 17th century, the Omani Sultanate was an empire, vying with the Portuguese and British empires for influence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. At its peak in the 19th century, Omani influence and control extended across the Strait of Hormuz to Iran and Pakistan, and as far south as Zanzibar. When its power declined in the 20th century, the sultanate came under the influence of the United Kingdom. For over 300 years, the relations built between the two empires were based on mutual benefit. The UK recognized Omans geographical importance as a trading hub that secured their trading lanes in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean and protected their empire in the Indian sub-continent. Historically, Muscat was the principal trading port of the Persian Gulf region.\\nOman is an absolute monarchy led by a Sultan, with power passed down through the male line. Qaboos bin Said was the Sultan from 1970 until his death on 10 January 2020. Qaboos bin Said, who died childless, had named his cousin, Haitham bin Tariq, as his successor in a letter, and the family confirmed him as the new Sultan of Oman.Formerly a maritime empire, Oman is the oldest continuously independent state in the Arab world. It is a member of the United Nations, the Arab League, the Gulf Cooperation Council, the Non-Aligned Movement and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. It has oil reserves ranked 22nd globally. In 2010, the United Nations Development Programme ranked Oman as the most improved nation in the world in terms of development during the preceding 40 years. A portion of its economy involves tourism and trading fish, dates and other agricultural produce. Oman is categorized as a high-income economy and, as of 2022, ranks as the 64th most peaceful country in the world according to the Global Peace Index."

At one of the two maternity wards at the university hospital where Semmelweis worked, physicians performed autopsies on every deceased patient. Semmelweiss procedure saved many lives by stopping the ongoing contamination of patients mostly pregnant women with what he termed cadaverous particles, twenty years before germ theory was discovered. Despite the overwhelming empirical evidence, his fellow doctors rejected his hand-washing suggestions, often for non-medical reasons. For instance, some doctors refused to believe that a gentlemans hands could transmit disease.While there is uncertainty regarding its origin and generally accepted use, the expression Semmelweis Reflex had been used by the author Robert Anton Wilson. In Wilsons book The Game of Life, Timothy Leary provided the following polemical definition of the Semmelweis reflex: Mob behavior found among primates and larval hominids on undeveloped planets, in which a discovery of important scientific fact is punished.\\nIn the preface to the fiftieth anniversary edition of his book The Myth of Mental Illness, Thomas Szasz says that Semmelweiss biography impressed upon him at a young age, a deep sense of the invincible social power of false truths."

However, pressing Alt twice while playing the game will cause the mouse cursor to show up.

The game is over when time runs out, or when a ball enters a hole of the wrong color. However, gray is a neutral color and therefore if a gray ball goes into the hole of a different color or if any ball goes into a gray hole nothing will happen. Some blocks have special properties, such as breaking when hit, opening and closing at intervals, changing the balls color or making the ball accelerate. InkBall has a variety of difficulty levels, ranging from Beginner, to Novice, to Intermediate, to Advanced and finally to Expert.

            "Second Temple period, The Second Temple period in Jewish history lasted approximately 600 years 516 BCE - 70 CE, during which the Second Temple existed. It started with the return to Zion and the construction of the Second Temple, while it ended with the First JewishRoman War and the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE.\\nIn 587/6 BCE, the Kingdom of Judah was conquered by the Neo-Babylonian Empire. The Judeans lost their independence and monarchy, and their holy city was destroyed. Part of the Judean population was exiled to Babylon; it was eventually allowed to return following a proclamation by the Persian king Cyrus the Great that was issued after the fall of Babylon to the Achaemenid Empire. Under Persian provincial governance c. 539 c. 332 BCE, the returned Jewish population in Judah was allowed to self-govern and rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem. In 332 BCE, Judea was conquered by Alexander the Great, and later incorporated into the Ptolemaic Kingdom c. 301-200 BCE and the Seleucid Empire c. 200167 BCE.\\nThe Maccabean revolt against Seleucid rule led to the establishment of an independent Hasmonean Kingdom 14037 BCE, which later, via a series of military campaigns expanded over much of modern Israel and parts of Jordan and Lebanon. In 63 BCE, the kingdom was conquered by the Roman Republic, and in 37 BCE, the Romans appointed Herod the Great as king of a vassal Judea. In 6 BCE, it was fully incorporated into the Roman Empire as the province of Judaea. Growing dissatisfaction with Roman rule eventually led to the First Jewish-Roman War 66-73 CE, which resulted in the destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple, bringing an end to the Second Temple period.\\nAs Second Temple Judaism developed, multiple religious currents emerged and extensive cultural, religious, and political developments occurred. The development of the Hebrew Bible canon, the synagogue and Jewish eschatology can be traced back to the Second Temple period. According to Jewish tradition, prophecy ceased during the early Second Temple period; this left the Jews without their version of divine guidance at a time when they felt most in need of support and direction. Under Hellenistic rule, the growing influence of Hellenism in Judaism became a source of dissent for those Jews who clung to their monotheistic faith; this was a major catalyst for the Maccabean revolt. A number of messianic ideas developed during the later Second Temple period. From c. 170 BCE to 30 CE, five successive generations of zugot pairs of leaders headed the Jews spiritual affairs. It was during this period that the sects of the Pharisees, Sadducees, Essenes, Zealots, and early Christianity were formed.\\nThe destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple in 70 CE is considered one of the most cataclysmic events in Jewish history. The loss of mother-city and temple necessitated a reshaping of Jewish culture to ensure its survival. Judaisms Temple-based sects, most notably the Sadducees, diminished in importance and disappeared. Rabbinic Judaism, centered around communal synagogue worship and Torah study, eventually evolved out of the Pharisaic school and became the mainstream form of the religion. During the same period, Christianity gradually separated from Judaism, becoming a predominantly Gentile religion. A few decades after the First Jewish-Roman War, the Bar-Kokhba Revolt 132-135 CE erupted; it further dwindled the Jewish population in Judea and enhanced the role of Jewish diaspora, relocating the Jewish demographic center to Galilee and Babylon, with smaller communities across the Mediterranean."

During the War of 1812, the town was the site of the Battle of York and suffered heavy damage by American troops. York was renamed and incorporated in 1834 as the city of Toronto. It was designated as the capital of the province of Ontario in 1867 during Canadian Confederation.

Lil Nas X also recorded a remix with American country singer Billy Ray Cyrus, which was released on April 5, 2019. Both were included in Lil Nas Xs second EP, 7 2019.\\nThe song has been widely labeled as country rap, a genre that had not often reached the mainstream prior to its release. Dutch record producer YoungKio composed the instrumental and made it available for purchase online in 2018. It features a sample of 34 Ghosts IV by the American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails. The sample was placed behind trap-style Roland TR-808 drums and bass. Lil Nas X purchased the instrumental for US$30 and recorded Old Town Road in one day. At the time, he had been living with his sister after dropping out of college; his real-world struggles were an influence on some of the lyrics.\\nThe song initially gained popularity on the social video sharing app TikTok and eventually entered the Billboard charts in March 2019. The song reached number 19 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart before the magazine disqualified it from the chart on the grounds that it did not fit the genre, sparking a debate on the definition of country music. Though it was not re-entered onto the overall country charts, both versions of the song collectively peaked at number one on the general Billboard Hot 100, for a record-breaking nineteen consecutive weeks. One or more versions of Old Town Road have topped the national singles charts in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, and have charted in the top 10 in various other markets.\\nThe song was certified diamond by the RIAA in October 2019 for selling ten million total units in the United States, the fastest song to be certified diamond. At the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards, the remix featuring Billy Ray Cyrus was nominated for Record of the Year and won Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and Best Music Video. In October 2019, Nas Xs label Columbia Records/Sony Music Entertainment, won the Music & Sound Recordings Award from SAG-AFTRA for work that exemplifies equal access of LGBTQ and other misrepresented or underrepresented groups.\\nIn September 2021, the song set the record as the second highest certified song ever by the RIAA with 16-times platinum status in the United States, meaning it accumulated 16 million equivalent song units. It has sold over 18 million records worldwide, making it one of the best-selling singles of all time. Rolling Stone named it the 490th greatest song of all time in its 2021 list.\\n\\n"

Psychic numbing can be a response to threats as diverse as financial and economic collapse, the risk of nuclear weapon detonations, pandemics, and global warming. It is also important to consider the neuroscience behind the phenomenon, which gives validation to the observable human behavior. The term has evolved to include both societies as well as individuals, so psychic numbing can be viewed from either a collectivist or an individualist standpoint. Individualist psychic numbing is found in rape survivors and people who have post-traumatic stress disorder."

Traditionally, Aesops fables were arranged alphabetically, which is not helpful to the reader. Perry listed them by language Greek then Latin, chronologically, by source, and then alphabetically; the Spanish scholar Francisco Rodrguez Adrados created a similar system.

The flower is 5 to 8 centimetres 2 to 3 in in diameter and has two slightly overlapping upper petals, two side petals, and a single bottom petal with a slight beard emanating from the flowers center. These petals are usually white or yellow, purplish, or blue. The plant may grow to 23 cm 9 in in height, and prefers sun to varying degrees and well-draining soils."

As Carnac, Carson wore a large feathered turban and a cape. The character would emerge from behind the shows curtain accompanied by Indian music, and make his way towards the desk, where he would invariably stumble on the step in front of the desk and lose his balance. On one occasion frequently rebroadcast on anniversary shows, Carsons desk was replaced with a lightweight balsa-wood version; this allowed Carson to trip and smash through it.\\nThe character was taken from Steve Allens essentially identical Answer Man segment, which Allen performed during his tenure as host of The Tonight Show in the 1950s. As Allen acknowledged in his book The Question Man, this bit had been created in Kansas City in 1951 by Bob Arbogast and used on The Tom Poston Show in New York where it eventually ended up on The Steve Allen Show, much to the surprise of both Arbogast and Allen. The Carnac character and routine also closely resemble Ernie Kovacs Mr. Question Man. As a more serious device, the concept had served as the basis for several game shows including the CBS Television Quiz, Thats the Question and the still-running Jeopardy!, which aired on NBC for much of Carsons run on Tonight."

The game was published by Midway Games for PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The PC version was published by Encore in North America and by Zoo Digital Publishing in Europe. In North America, the game was released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in March 2004, and for PC in June of the same year. In Europe, it was released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in May, and for PC in July. A port was also planned for the GameCube, but was cancelled. In 2017, the game was released on GOG.com by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, the current owner of the IP after acquiring publisher Midway Games assets following the latter companys bankruptcy in 2009.\\nThe Suffering centers on the story of Torque, a prisoner on death row for murdering his ex-wife and two children, a crime that he possesses no memory of committing. Shortly after he arrives in Abbot State Penitentiary on Carnate Island, off the coast of Maryland, an earthquake hits the island, resulting in the prison being attacked by supernatural threats from the islands past. After being freed, Torque attempts to fight his way to freedom while confronting his own personal demons, all while attempting to remember what really happened to his family. The game features three endings which depend on the players gameplay choices throughout, each of which reveals a different version of the murder of Torques family.\\nThe Suffering received primarily positive reviews. Some critics felt the blend of action with horror didnt work, and that the game was not sufficiently scary, although game designer Richard Rouse III has stated several times that the game is action horror as opposed to survival horror like Resident Evil, Silent Hill and Fatal Frame. Many also lauded the creature design, the tone, and the games morality system, which determines both the ending, and how certain characters interact with Torque during the game. The Suffering was a commercial success, selling over 1.5 million units worldwide across all platforms. In 2005, a sequel was released, The Suffering: Ties That Bind."

It has a twelve bar blues progression, using only three chords until the coda.\\nThe eleven cries of Batman! are sung by a chorus of four tenors and four sopranos performed by The Ron Hicklin Singers. A common misconception is that the chorus is actually a horn section, a rumor began shortly after the TV series ended its initial run in 1968, and gained attention from Adam Wests 1994 book Back to the Batcave, in which he incorrectly recalled that the theme featured horns rather than vocals. Neal Hefti, the writer of the theme, stated that the chorus was made up of eight singers, one of whom jokingly wrote on his part, word and music by Neal Hefti. According to TVs Biggest Hits by Jon Burlingame, which includes an interview with Hefti about the creation of the song, the song consists of bass guitar, low brass and percussion to create a driving rhythm, while an eight-voice chorus sings Batman! in harmony with the trumpets.In addition to Neal Heftis original version, and the television soundtrack version by Nelson Riddle, versions were covered by The Marketts single Batman Theme and album The Batman Theme by The Marketts, The Ventures The Ventures Play the Batman Theme, Dolton BST8042, 3/1966, Al Hirt, The Standells and actor/musician David McCallum.\\nThe song has been parodied in the more than half-a-century since its debut.

Shortly after the arcade game launch, Super Monaco GP was ported to Segas video game consoles, the Genesis, Game Gear, and Master System. British developer U.S. Gold published ports for home computers.\\nThe arcade game was a major worldwide hit; in Japan, it was the third highest-grossing arcade game of 1989 and then the highest-grossing dedicated arcade game of 1990.

From there Dubroc goes on a quest to destroy The eYe. Many elements of the story were adapted into the Queen musical We Will Rock You.\\nQueen: The eYe came on five CDs, each of which includes several of the Queen tracks in the Red Book audio format used by audio CD players, though some songs can only be heard by playing the game.

The order is usually placed through a 1-800 number call center and the payment by credit card formerly C.O.D. The selling point of this approach is that the item is too cutting edge for a store. Conversely, the not sold in stores label can be interpreted to be a detriment, if one takes it to mean that no established retailers are willing to give their imprimatur to the merchandise.\\nIn the last ten years, products not sold in stores have expanded from advertising on television almost exclusively to advertising on the Internet. Selling on the Internet also has reduced both the transaction costs of the selling through the automation of check-out and payment no more paid phone operators and the cost of the products themselves due to exemption from sales taxes. This trend of advertising on the Internet has further distinguished the not sold in stores genre from that of As seen on TV!.\\nDespite the increased Internet activity, advertising on television remains the primary means that products marketed in this fashion reach the public eye. Since 1993, both the not sold in stores and the as seen on TV factions have moved from simple sixty-second commercials on late-night or cable television to one to three-hour long infomercials.\\nNot sold in stores is beginning to be an advertising research tool. Items that do not actually exist are sold and the number of reactions determines whether the product might make a profit."

They traveled in PT boats through stormy seas patrolled by Japanese warships and reached Mindanao two days later. From there, MacArthur and his party flew to Australia in a pair of Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses, ultimately arriving in Melbourne by train on 21 March. In Australia, he made a speech in which he declared, I came through and I shall return.\\nMacArthur was a well-known and experienced officer with a distinguished record in World War I, who had retired from the United States Army in 1937 and had become a defense advisor to the Philippine government. He was recalled to active duty with the United States Army in July 1941, a few months before the outbreak of the Pacific War between the United States and the Empire of Japan, to become commander of United States Army Forces in the Far East USAFFE, uniting the Philippine and United States Armies under one command.\\nBy March 1942, the Japanese invasion of the Philippines had compelled MacArthur to withdraw his forces on Luzon to Bataan, while his headquarters and his family moved to Corregidor. The doomed defense of Bataan captured the imagination of the American public. At a time when the news from all fronts was uniformly bad, MacArthur became a living symbol of Allied resistance to the Japanese.\\nFearing that Corregidor would soon fall, and MacArthur would be taken prisoner, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered MacArthur to go to Australia. A submarine was made available, but MacArthur elected to break through the Japanese blockade in PT boats under the command of Lieutenant junior grade John D. Bulkeley. The staff MacArthur brought with him became known as the Bataan Gang. They would become the nucleus of his General Headquarters GHQ Southwest Pacific Area SWPA."

The story is of a smith who makes a pact with a malevolent beingcommonly the Devil in later times, Death, a demon or a genieselling his soul for some power, then tricks the devil out of his prize. In one version, the smith gains the power to weld any material, he then uses this power to stick the devil to an immovable object, allowing the smith to renege on the bargain. It is indexed as ATU330.The tale was collected by Giambattista Basile in Lo cunto de li cunti of 1634, then the Brothers Grimm in their Childrens and Household Tales published in two volumes in 1812 and 1815, although they removed it in editions of 1822 and later, substituting Brother Lustig and relegating references to it to the notes for Gambling Hansel, a very similar tale. Edith Hodgetts 1891 book Tales and Legends from the Land of the Tsar collects a Russian version, while Ruth Manning-Sanders included a Gascon version as The Blacksmith and the Devil in her 1970 book A Book of Devils and Demons. Richard Chase presents a version from the Southern Appalachians, called Wicked John and the Devil.According to George Monbiot, the blacksmith is a motif of folklore throughout and beyond Europe associated with malevolence the medieval vision of Hell may draw upon the image the smith at his forge, and several variant tales tell of smiths entering into a pact with the devil to obtain fire and the means of smelting metal.According to research applying phylogenetic techniques to linguistics by folklorist Sara Graa da Silva and anthropologist Jamie Tehrani, The Smith and the Devil may be one of the oldest European folk tales, with the basic plot stable throughout the Indo-European speaking world from India to Scandinavia, possibly being first told in Indo-European 6,000 years ago in the Bronze Age. Folklorist John Lindow, however, notes that a word for smith may not have existed in Indo-European, and if so the tale may not be that old. However, according to historical linguist Vclav Blaek: The apparent fact, that there is no common designation of smith in the Indo-European lexicon, could be disappointing at first sight, but the same may be said about other crafts, including those using more archaic technologies than smithery. According to Blaek, the inherited designations for smith attested in the mythological context are a witness of a remarkably important role of the institution of smithery in the period of disintegration of the Indo-European dialect continuum."

Players have three health canisters, and every hit diminishes one of them. After three hits, the player counts as dead and has to respawn after a delay.\\nThe game is based on a heavily modified Quake engine, and despite being a budget-title, features some elements that were unique at the time of release. For example, the game models Lasertag Grenades which emit a vast number of shots in all directions, tagging every player in the vicinity.\\nThe Mega Target game mode is rather novel in that it requires players to hit three targets strewn across the playing arena, before they are allowed to enter a core in which they shoot a final target to score a point. As an added element, automated defense turrets shoot at enemy players, and some can be converted to fight for your team by shooting at a sensor above the turret. This disables the turret for a few seconds and, if its a convertible turret, makes it fight for your side until an enemy deactivates/converts it again.\\nThe game does not feature different weapons, instead the player can collect powerups that increase the firing rate or the hit damage thus reducing an enemys energy canisters by two instead of one for a limited time.\\nThe graphics engine offers Glide, OpenGL, and software rendering. Multiplayer supports up to 8 players either competitively or against bots via LAN or GameSpy. Although not officially supported, the game is moddable, and a single mod named LaserArena Enhanced exists, improving textures and sounds as well as adding some useful keybinds that were not available in the original game."

            "Flight Assignment: A.T.P., Flight Assignment: A.T.P. Airline Transport Pilot or simply ATP was an amateur flight simulator released in 1990 by the Sublogic Corporation. It runs on DOS based PCs. The simulation models the Boeing 737, 747, 767, Airbus A320 and Shorts 360. It features most major aviation beacons in the United States and about 30 major airports. It also includes a multi-voiced air traffic control simulator.\\nThe games July 1990 release was snarled by a lawsuit from Microsoft, which claimed ownership of some of Sublogics source code rights, and it was settled with a number of concessions on the part of Sublogic, most notably dropping the phrase flight simulator from all of its products. This allowed the release of ATP in December 1990. Releases and updates continued through 1993, and the software remained on the market until December 13, 1995.In late 1994, Italian company LAGO and Austrian company Nomissoft released a plugin for ATP entitled 3D Advanced Graphics System. The companies went on to purchase rights to portions of the ATP code from Sierra, which had acquired Sublogic in 1995. Although Sierras own plans for a re-release of ATP on the Windows platform never came to fruition, LAGO and Nomissoft gave new life to the ATP code with the release of their own product, Airline Simulator in September 1996.In April 1997, LAGO and Nomissoft showed a successor. Airline Simulator 2 Pro was demonstrated at a conference in Europe, but by that December development was halted, as the two companies parted due to fundamental disagreements about the way forward. In March 1998, Nomissoft announced that it had secured the necessary rights to Airline Simulator 2 code, and by August 4, 1999, the grandchild of Sublogic ATP hit retail.\\nDevelopment of another followup, Airline Simulator 3, had long been teased by Nomissoft founder Simon Hradecky in parallel with Airline Simulator 2s development, but within weeks of AS2s release, AS3s development had been taken over by Aerosoft, a German company. Again, development stagnated, and finally in January 2013, the company confirmed that development had been ceased and the project written off."

The player controls an employee of FizzCo, who has to fight off the OD, short for Overcharge Drinkers: humans who have turned into mutants after drinking FizzCos energy drink beverage. In the dystopian Sunset City, the player character can wall-run, use zip-lines, and grind rails to swiftly navigate through it, with a large arsenal of weapons to use. The game also has a cooperative multiplayer mode called Chaos Squad, which tasks players to complete a series of missions with seven players. As the game puts emphasis on momentum, the game does not feature any cover system.\\nThe development of the game began in 2011 when Insomniac completed Resistance 3. After the project was green-lit internally, the studio partnered with Microsoft Studios, which helped fund the game and allowed Insomniac to keep the rights to the franchise. Insomniac described the game as a celebration of games, as the team took inspiration from different sources, including Prince of Persia, Jet Set Radio and Tony Hawks Pro Skater, though at its early stage of development the team took inspirations from DayZ instead. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic future, but the team depicted it as an awesomepocalypse that turns the games initial world depiction into a playground for players. Sunset Overdrive uses Insomniacs internal engine, previously used in Fuse.\\nIt was announced at E3 2013, and released worldwide for Xbox One in October 2014. A Windows version, developed by Blind Squirrel Games, was released in November 2018. The game received generally positive reviews, with praise for its visuals, traversal system, combat system, and humor. However, the game was criticized for the lack of a compelling story or innovative quest design. It received numerous nominations, including Best Xbox Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. The game was supported with multiple pieces of downloadable content, including the story-based The Mystery of the Mooil Rig and Dawn of the Rise of the Fallen Machine, after the games release."

He then proceeded to impact his reign through several other characters in the square by going to extreme lengths in order to maintain his control over those around him most notably in the case of his intense feud against the Mitchell Brothers that consist of both the squares undisputed top-dog Phil Mitchell Steve McFadden and his younger brother Grant Ross Kemp.\\nThe characters story arc began with Johnny usurping fellow mob boss Andy Hunter Michael Higgs from his position as the squares reigning crime kingpin, which ultimately leads Andy to try and swindle 750,000 from Johnny in his requested job; however, this fails after Johnny intercepts his plan thanks to Andys bodyguard Eddie Daren Elliott Holmes and he ends up killing Andy by throwing him off a motorway bridge during the shows 20th anniversary episode. Soon afterwards, Johnny proceeded to force the local Ferreira family out of Walford before going on to establish an unlikely friendship with his old acquaintance Pat Harris Pam St Clement; exile his errand boy Danny Moon Jake Maskall from the square in retribution for Danny burning down his house; become enemies with Phil and Grants mother, Peggy Barbara Windsor, after she turns his daughter Ruby Louisa Lytton against him; destroy his own relationship with former mistress Tina Stewart Charlotte Avery; hire Peggys nephew Billy Perry Fenwick to become Dannys replacement until he later fires him for conspiring with his family; develop a conflict with Rubys best-friend, Stacey Slater Lacey Turner, over the way how their rebellious friendship strains his daughters education; blackmail Dannys brother Jake Joel Beckett with the discovery that his girlfriend Chrissie Watts Tracy-Ann Oberman murdered her estranged husband Den Leslie Grantham and framed Peggys daughter Sam Kim Medcalf for the crime; constantly torment Rubys boyfriend Juley Smith Joseph Kpobie upon learning that he is the reason she lost her virginity to him; and arrange for popular hardman Dennis Rickman Nigel Harman to be fatally stabbed on New Years Eve 2005 after being attacked by the latter in retaliation for threatening his adoptive sister-turned-recent wife Sharon Letitia Dean.\\nTowards the end of March 2006, Johnny represented the titular Get Johnny Week scenario in which Phil and Grant, who were both Sharons ex-lovers, sought to avenge her loss and Dennis murder by bringing Johnny to justice.

            "Social distancing",
            "Social distancing, In public health, social distancing, also called physical distancing, is a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions or measures intended to prevent the spread of a contagious disease by maintaining a physical distance between people and reducing the number of times people come into close contact with each other. It usually involves keeping a certain distance from others the distance specified differs from country to country and can change with time and avoiding gathering together in large groups.By minimising the probability that a given uninfected person will come into physical contact with an infected person, the disease transmission can be suppressed, resulting in fewer deaths. The measures may be used in combination with others, such as good respiratory hygiene, face masks and hand washing. To slow down the spread of infectious diseases and avoid overburdening healthcare systems, particularly during a pandemic, several social-distancing measures are used, including the closing of schools and workplaces, isolation, quarantine, restricting the movement of people and the cancellation of mass gatherings. Drawbacks of social distancing can include loneliness, reduced productivity and the loss of other benefits associated with human interaction.Social distancing measures are most effective when the infectious disease spreads via one or more of the following methods, droplet contact coughing or sneezing, direct physical contact including sexual contact, indirect physical contact such as by touching a contaminated surface, and airborne transmission if the microorganism can survive in the air for long periods. The measures are less effective when an infection is transmitted primarily via contaminated water or food or by vectors such as mosquitoes or other insects. Authorities have encouraged or mandated social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic as it is an important method of preventing transmission of COVID-19. COVID-19 is much more likely to spread over short distances than long ones. However, it can spread over distances longer than 2 m 6 ft in enclosed, poorly ventilated places and with prolonged exposure.Although the term social distancing was not introduced until the 21st century, social-distancing measures date back to at least the 5th century BC. The Bible contains one of the earliest known references to the practice in the Book of Leviticus 13:46: And the leper in whom the plague is. he shall dwell alone; outside the camp shall his habitation be. During the Plague of Justinian of 541 to 542, Emperor Justinian enforced an ineffective quarantine on the Byzantine Empire, including dumping bodies into the sea; he predominantly blamed the widespread outbreak on Jews, Samaritans, pagans, heretics, Arians, Montanists and homosexuals. In modern times, social distancing measures have been successfully implemented in several epidemics. In St. Louis, shortly after the first cases of influenza were detected in the city during the 1918 flu pandemic, authorities implemented school closures, bans on public gatherings and other social-distancing interventions. The influenza fatality rates in St. Louis were much less than in Philadelphia, which had fewer cases of influenza but allowed a mass parade to continue and did not introduce social distancing until more than two weeks after its first cases.The World Health Organization WHO has suggested using the term physical distancing instead of social distancing because it is physical separation which prevents transmission; people can remain socially connected by meeting outdoors at a safe distance when there is no stay-at-home order and by meeting via technology."

The ideal bullseye has the entire postmark inside the margins, although this is not always possible, because the stamp may be too small or the postmark too large. The colloquial expression Socked on the nose does not seem to be used in Europe: the terms Oblitration centrale in French or luxus in German are in common usage.\\nAustria introduced ca 1868 a set of cancellations of small diameter < 20 mm, so that they could be seen entirely on all stamps.Some philatelists and collectors of cancellations have a special interest in bullseyes primarily because the date, time, and place the stamp was used, or postmarked, can be identified by the cancellation. This allows specialised collectors to collect, for example, all of the postmarks of a particular country, state, city, county, date range, etc., without collecting entire covers.There can be some confusion with the term Bullseye as it can mean both the type of cancel, such as the early American concentric ring cancel as well as other countries that used them and to have a cancel positioned right in the center of a stamp. So while an SON cancel is always near the centre of a stamp and can be an example of a Circular Date Stamp CDS or a Bullseye cancel or other shapes that were used as cancelling devices, Square, Oval etc. strictly speaking a Bullseye Cancel literally is a cancel that looks like a bullseye. \\nBecause modern machine cancellations are normally arranged so that the wavy lines, slogans, or other killers are applied to the stamp, leaving the postmark clear, dealers and collectors desiring SONs will position the stamp on the cover so as to fall under the postmark."

Colin Baird at the University of Western Ontario in 1972.The lowest triplet state of an annulene is, according to Bairds rule, aromatic when it has 4n -electrons and antiaromatic when the -electron count is 4n + 2, where n is any positive integer. This trend is opposite to that predicted by Hckels rule for the ground state, which is usually the lowest singlet state S0. Bairds rule has thus become known as the photochemical analogue of Hckels rule.Through various theoretical investigations, this rule has also been found to extend to the lowest lying singlet excited state S1 of small annulenes."

Targets of the supposed espionage included elected officials including the four presidents of the Generalitat of Catalonia since 2010, two presidents of the Parliament of Catalonia, and MEPs, activists, lawyers, and computer scientists; in some cases, families of the main targets were also purportedly targeted.The scandal was unleashed by the publication of an article in the New Yorker magazine, quoting studies by the University of Torontos Citizen Lab, in which they examined the use of Pegasus spyware by different countries Pegasus is only sold to governments who, according to Israels own government, follow rule of law, and alleged to have found evidence of its use in phones owned by several Catalan separatist politicians and their entourage. The study completely overlooked the publicly-known fact that many of those politicians had recently been involved in and tried for, and in some instances found guilty of several crimes and misdemeanors, from embezzlement to sedition, and were in fact under judicially-approved government surveillance. The domain catalangate.cat was registered by mnium Cultural on 28 January 2022 - months before the espionage scandal which came to be known as CatalanGate came to light. and the CatalanGate name itself was coined by separatist politician Ernest Maragall, as reported by a book written by leading separatist activist see quotes below in which he relates how Citizen Lab produced tailored research to build judiciary evidence for large technology companies targeting NSO Group in the US courts; evidence of indirect funding by Apple and others has already been found. Together with alleged deficiencies in the research methodology including the fact that the lead evidence gatherer on behalf of Citizen Lab was a known separatist activist, but also including deficient methodology, this has founded accusations from several instances most notably the Foro de Profesores collective that the scandal is essentially a publicity stunt to discredit the Spanish governments investigations into past and continuing criminal activity by the surveilled people, and to cover earlier surveillance by the regional secessionist government of opposition politicians.According to Spanish defense officials and to ex-president of the Generalitat Carles Puigdemont himself the subject of a suspended Euro detention order for his alleged actions, he and his inner circle had been aware of CitizenLabs findings for over a year and pushed to release the findings against the wishes of CitizenLab which sought to gather additional evidence before revealing their findings to try to deflect attention from Puigdemonts ties with Russia and Putin as well as to influence the upcoming CJEU ruling regarding Puigdemonts immunity.The Citizen Lab report was published on April 18, 2022. The report identified up to 65 alleged victims, consummated or attempted. The number of targets exceeded previous cases of espionage studied by Citizen Lab, far surpassing those of Al Jazeera 36 victims and El Salvador 35 victims. Citizen Lab did not definitively attribute the responsibility for the attacks to a particular perpetrator, however, it went on to state that circumstantial evidence strongly suggests the perpetrator to be the Spanish Government. The term CatalanGate was used as title of the Citizen Lab report. Despite the scandals dissemination as CatalanGate, it also allegedly affected two prominent Basque pro-independence figures."

As its name suggests, it is most commonly eaten at lunchtime. It is particularly associated with pubs, and often served with beer.Beer, bread, and cheese have been combined in the English diet since antiquity, and have been served together in inns for centuries. However, the specific term ploughmans lunch is believed to date from the 1950s, when the Cheese Bureau, a marketing body, began promoting it in pubs as a way to increase the sales of cheese, which had recently ceased to be rationed. Its popularity increased as the Milk Marketing Board promoted the meal nationally throughout the 1960s."

The rumour began circulating in 1967, gaining broad popularity in September 1969 following reports on American college campuses. \\nAccording to the theory, McCartney died in a car crash, and to spare the public from grief, the surviving Beatles replaced him with a McCartney look-alike, subsequently communicating this secret through subtle details of their albums. Proponents perceived clues among elements of Beatles songs and cover artwork; clue-hunting proved infectious, and by October 1969 had become an international phenomenon. Rumours declined after Life magazine published an interview with McCartney in November 1969. \\nThe phenomenon was the subject of analysis in the fields of sociology, psychology, and communications during the 1970s. McCartney parodied the hoax with the title and cover art of his 1993 live album, Paul Is Live. The legend was among ten of the worlds most enduring conspiracy theories according to Time magazine in 2009."

For the purposes of the documentary, the team of scientists divides two hypothetical examples of realistic worlds on which extraterrestrial life could evolve: A tidally locked planet dubbed Aurelia orbiting a red dwarf star and a large moon dubbed Blue Moon orbiting a gas giant in a binary star system.

Josh is characterised as a charming, confident, energetic and cheeky foundation doctor F1. He starts his rotation at Holby City Hospital alongside F1s Jeong-Soo Han Chan Woo Lim and Skylar Bryce Phoebe Pryce; they often feature together in their early stories.\\nMost of Joshs stories revolve around his relationship with consultant Ange Godard Dawn Steele, which is marred by the ethics of a junior doctor-mentor romance and the age difference between them. Light relief scenes were created through the secretive nature of the relationship. Blackwood-Cambridge and Steele filmed close contact scenes for the pair after isolating for a week before filming. The relationship was challenged through the introduction of Joshs mother, Elaine Hudson Carol Walton, and Ange becoming pregnant with twins. Writers coincided the twins premature birth with a bomb explosion at the hospital, leaving the lives of Josh, Ange and his new family unit in danger.\\nProducers used the character to explore the issue of bulimia nervosa over several months. Josh begins struggling after becoming a father and beginning a new rotation on the cardiothoracic unit. A friendship with clinical lead Eli Ebrahimi Davood Ghadami was established as Josh struggles to tell Ange. The story develops when he begins therapy, where he meets Claudia Blaise Lottie Tolhurst.

The essay and the term caused criticism from liberal intelligentsia, such as Solzhenitsyns long-time opponent Grigory Pomerants and Boris Shragin, as well as being among the reasons of the bitter contention between Solzhenitsyn and the Russian third wave of emigration of dissidents.Wyksztaciuchy is a similar term used in Poland, a country that shares the concept of intelligentsia with Russia.Solzhenitsyn defines obrazovanshchina as the category of people who refer to themselves as intelligentsia solely on the basis of having a higher than middle education. Solzhenitsyn explains the selection of the term by reference to Vladimir Dahls dictionary, which distinguished the terms to educate and to enlighten, the former concept having a superficial character, external gloss.A similar criticism of Russian intelligentsia came from Nikolai Berdyaev, who coined the ironic word intelligentshchina for the part of intelligentia locked in their own world, isolated from the rest of the Russian society."

The film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Jack Slater, a Los Angeles police detective within the Jack Slater action film franchise, while Austin OBrien co-stars as Danny Madigan, a boy magically transported into the Slater universe, and Charles Dance as Mr. Benedict, a ruthless assassin from the Slater universe who escapes to the real world. Schwarzenegger also served as the films executive producer and plays himself as the actor portraying Jack Slater.\\nLast Action Hero failed to meet the studios expectations at the box office, and was both a critical and commercial disappointment.

Directed by Niki Caro from a screenplay by Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Lauren Hynek, and Elizabeth Martin, it is a live-action adaptation of Disneys 1998 animated film of the same name, itself based on the Chinese folklore story Ballad of Mulan. The film stars Yifei Liu in the title role, alongside Donnie Yen, Tzi Ma, Jason Scott Lee, Yoson An, Ron Yuan, Gong Li, and Jet Li in supporting roles. In the film, Hua Mulan, the eldest daughter of an honored warrior, masquerades as a man to take her ailing fathers place during a general conscription to counter the Rouran army in Imperial China.\\nPlans for a live-action remake began in 2010 but the project stalled in development hell for most of the decade. Filming took place in New Zealand and China from August to November 2018. Over the course of production, the film was the subject of several controversies, including changes to the source material and filming in Xinjiang in light of the Uyghur genocide and Xinjiang internment camps. The film also received criticism for its production team largely consisting of people of non-Chinese descent. This included the hiring of Caro, rather than an Asian director.\\nMulan held its world premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood on March 9, 2020. The film was originally scheduled for a wide theatrical release later that month, but was cancelled in the United States after being delayed several times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Subsequently, the film was released on September 4, 2020 by Disney+ for a premium fee known as Premier Access in countries where the service had launched. The film had a traditional theatrical release in countries without Disney+ where theaters had re-opened.\\nDue to its overall limited theatrical release as a result of the pandemic, the film grossed just under $70 million not including revenue from Disney+ Premier Access against a production budget of $200 million. The film received generally positive reviews from Western, non-Asian critics, who praised the action sequences, costumes, and performances, but was criticized for the screenplay and editing. However, it received unfavorable reviews from fans of the original animated film, Chinese diaspora, and Chinese critics, who criticized the character development, its cultural and historical inaccuracies, and its depiction of Chinese people. At the 93rd Academy Awards and 26th Critics Choice Awards, the film received nominations for its costume design and visual effects, as well as a Best Special Visual Effects nod at the 74th British Academy Film Awards. A sequel is in development."

The earliest mention of a sea swine can be traced to ancient Greece. In this context, the name has been interpreted to mean porpoise, as a porpoise and pig have similar round body shapes. However, this is disputed by some classical scholars who believe that the porcus section of the name referred instead to grunts emitted from fish in question, not any physical similarities to the pig.The creatures appeared in the Carta marina, and were depicted in accompanying wood carvings, as fantastical beasts with four dragons feet and a single eye at the navel. The map placed the creatures as living in the waters south of Iceland.Additional accounts from the 16th and 17th century delineated the sea swine from more mundane sea creatures. The animals were described as headed like a Hog, toothed, and tusked like a Boar. The Sea Hogs were reported as travelling in packs with hundreds of individuals. However, contemporary naturalist John Ray was explicit in stating that the sea swine and porpoise were one and the same."

It is the sixth game in the Terra Cresta series, following the 1992 game Terra Cresta II for the PC-Engine. The player assumes control of three starships as they must complete six stages while destroying enemies and avoiding collision with them and their projectiles. By collecting small F icons the player can merge the three ships into one and gain access to new, more destructive weapons.\\n3D is the second entry in the series to have no involvement with creator Shigeki Fujiawara, who several years prior departed from Nichibutsu to work on the Bomberman series for Hudson Soft. This left the company struggling to produce any successful action-oriented titles, shifting focus towards pornographic mahjong arcade games instead. Terra Cresta 3D was negatively received for its gameplay, level design and inferiority to similar games on the platform, although its graphics and soundtrack were praised by some. It is one of Nichibutsus final games, as they ceased their video game operations in the early 2000s."

Players assume the role of a space marine, popularly known as Doomguy, fighting their way through hordes of invading demons from hell. Id began developing Doom after the release of their previous FPS, Wolfenstein 3D 1992. It emerged from a 3D game engine developed by John Carmack, who wanted to create a science fiction game inspired by Dungeons & Dragons and the films Evil Dead II and Aliens. The first episode, comprising nine levels, was distributed freely as shareware; the full game, with two further episodes, was sold via mail order. An updated version with an additional episode and more difficult levels, The Ultimate Doom, was released in 1995 and sold at retail.\\nDoom is one of the most significant games in video game history, frequently cited as one of the greatest games ever made. It sold an estimated 3.5 million copies by 1999; between 10 and 20 million people are estimated to have played it within two years of launch, and in late 1995, it was estimated to be installed on more computers worldwide than Microsofts then-new operating system, Windows 95. Along with Wolfenstein 3D, Doom helped define the FPS genre and inspired numerous similar games, often called Doom clones. It pioneered online distribution and technologies including 3D graphics, networked multiplayer gaming, and support for custom modifications via packaged WAD files. Its graphic violence and supposed hellish imagery drew controversy from different groups, such as parents and the news.\\nDoom has been ported to numerous platforms. The Doom franchise continued with Doom II: Hell on Earth 1994 and expansion packs including Master Levels for Doom II 1995. The source code was released in 1997 under a proprietary license, and then later in 1999 under the GNU General Public License v2.0 or later. Doom 3, a horror game built with the id Tech 4 engine, was released in 2004, followed by a 2005 Doom film. id returned to the fast-paced action of the classic games with the 2016 game Doom and the 2020 sequel Doom Eternal."

            "Zero-tolerance policies in schools, A zero-tolerance policy in schools is a strict enforcement of regulations and bans against behaviors or the possession of items deemed undesirable by said schools. Public criticism against the enforcement of such policies has arisen due to potential negative consequences when acts deemed intolerable are done in ignorance, by accident, or under extenuating circumstances, in addition to its connection to educational inequality in the United States. In schools, common zero-tolerance policies concern possession or use of illicit drugs or weapons. Students, and sometimes staff, parents, and other visitors, who possess a banned item for any reason are always if the policy is followed to be punished.\\nIn the United States and Canada, zero-tolerance policies have been adopted in various schools and other education venues. Zero-tolerance policies in the United States became widespread in 1994, after federal legislation required states to expel for one year any student who brought a firearm to school, or lose all federal funding.These policies are promoted as preventing drug abuse and violence in schools. Critics say zero-tolerance policies in schools have resulted in punishments that have been criticized as egregiously unfair against students and teachers, especially in schools with poorly written policies. Consequently, critics describe these policies as zero-logic policies because they treat juveniles the way that adults would be treated or more harshly, given that children are seldom granted full permission to speak up in their own defense to adults with authority over them. Many people have been critical of zero-tolerance policies, claiming that they are draconian, provide little if any benefit to anyone, contribute to overcrowding of the criminal justice system, and/or disproportionately target people of color, particularly people of African-American and Hispanic descent.\\n\\n"

This investigation resulted in making available to the public tax rulings for over three hundred multinational companies based in Luxembourg.\\nThe LuxLeaks disclosures attracted international attention and comment about tax avoidance schemes in Luxembourg and elsewhere. This scandal contributed to the implementation of measures aiming at reducing tax dumping and regulating tax avoidance schemes beneficial to multinational companies.\\nThe judicial aspects of this case concern the persons charged by Luxembourg justice for participating in the revelations. No multinational company was charged. The LuxLeaks trial took place in spring 2016 and led to the condemnation of the two whistleblowers. The appeal trials judgment delivered in March 2017 confirmed their condemnation. Following a new appeal, the Luxembourg higher Court rendered in January 2018 a distinct judgment for the two defendants and fully granted the whistleblower status for one of them."

It stars Humphrey Bogart, Walter Brennan and Lauren Bacall; it also features Dolores Moran, Hoagy Carmichael, Sheldon Leonard, Dan Seymour, and Marcel Dalio. The plot, centered on the romance between a freelancing fisherman in Martinique and a beautiful American drifter, is complicated by the growing French resistance in Vichy France.\\nErnest Hemingway and Howard Hawks were close friends and, on a fishing trip, Hawks told Hemingway, who was reluctant to go into screenwriting, that he could make a great movie from his worst book, which Hawks admitted was To Have and Have Not. Jules Furthman wrote the first screenplay, which was set in Cuba like the novel. However, the screenplay was altered to be set in Martinique instead of Cuba because the portrayal of Cubas government was believed to be in violation of the United States Good Neighbor policy with Latin American countries. Hawkss other good friend, William Faulkner, was the main contributor to the screenplay, including and following the revisions. Because of the contributions from both Hemingway and Faulkner, it is the only film story on which two winners of the Nobel Prize for Literature worked. Filming began on February 29, 1944, while Faulkner continued to work on the script, and ended on May 10.\\nThe film premiered in New York City on October 11, 1944. Audience reception was generally good. Critic reviews were mixed, with many claiming the film was a remake of Casablanca 1942. Critics specifically mentioned Lauren Bacalls performance or the chemistry between Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall on screen. Bogart and Bacall began an off-screen relationship during production and married in 1945, after the films release. To Have and Have Not was one of the top 10 grossing films of 1944 and received an award from the National Board of Review."

For unimodal distributions, the probability of being within the interval is at least 95% by the VysochanskijPetunin inequality. There may be certain assumptions for a distribution that force this probability to be at least 98%."

The predominant worldwide usage of the term in English is in the discipline of anthropology. This definition is contested, in part due to conflicting theoretical understandings of social and kinship structures, and also reflecting the problematic application of this concept to extremely diverse human societies. The concept is often contrasted by anthropologists with other social and kinship groups, being hierarchically larger than a lineage or clan, but smaller than a chiefdom, nation or state. These terms are equally disputed. In some cases tribes have legal recognition and some degree of political autonomy from national or federal government, but this legalistic usage of the term may conflict with anthropological definitions. \\nIn the United States, Native American tribes are legally considered to have domestic dependent nation status within the territorial United States, with a government-to-government relationship with the federal government."

            "Franklin D. Roosevelt, Franklin Delano Roosevelt ; ROH-z-velt, -vlt; January 30, 1882 April 12, 1945, often referred to by his initials FDR, was an American politician and attorney who served as the 32nd president of the United States from 1933 until his death in 1945. As the leader of the Democratic Party, he won a record four presidential elections and became a central figure in world events during the first half of the 20th century. Roosevelt directed the federal government during most of the Great Depression, implementing his New Deal domestic agenda in response to the worst economic crisis in U.S. history. He built the New Deal Coalition, which defined modern liberalism in the United States throughout the middle third of the 20th century. His third and fourth terms were dominated by World War II, which ended in victory shortly after he died in office.\\nBorn into the prominent Roosevelt family in Hyde Park, New York, he graduated from both Groton School and Harvard College, and attended Columbia Law School, which he left after passing the bar exam to practice law in New York City. In 1905, he married his fifth cousin once removed, Eleanor Roosevelt. They had six children, of whom five survived into adulthood. He won election to the New York State Senate in 1910, and then served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under President Woodrow Wilson during World War I. Roosevelt was James M. Coxs running mate on the Democratic Partys 1920 national ticket, but Cox was defeated by Republican Warren G. Harding. In 1921, Roosevelt contracted a paralytic illness diagnosed as polio and his legs became permanently paralyzed. While attempting to recover from his condition, Roosevelt founded a polio rehabilitation center in Warm Springs, Georgia. Although unable to walk unaided, Roosevelt returned to public office after his election as governor of New York in 1928. He served as governor from 1929 to 1933, promoting programs to combat the economic crisis besetting the United States.\\nIn the 1932 presidential election, Roosevelt defeated Republican incumbent Herbert Hoover and began his presidency in the midst of the Great Depression. During the first 100 days of the 73rd U.S. Congress, he spearheaded unprecedented federal legislative productivity. Roosevelt called for the creation of programs designed to produce relief, recovery, and reform. Within his first year, he began implementing these policies through a series of executive orders and federal legislation collectively called the New Deal. Many New Deal programs provided relief to the unemployed such as the National Recovery Administration. Several New Deal programs and federal laws such as the Agricultural Adjustment Act provided relief to farmers. Roosevelt also instituted major regulatory reforms related to finance, communications, and labor. In addition to the economy, Roosevelt sought to find a compromise on Prohibition with the urban and rural wings of the Democratic Party. After campaigning on a platform to repeal it, Roosevelt implemented the Beer Permit Act of 1933 and enforced the 21st amendment. Tax revenue collected from alcohol sales would go to public works as part of the New Deal. Roosevelt frequently used radio to speak directly to the American people, giving 30 fireside chat radio addresses during his presidency and became the first American president to be televised. The economy improved rapidly during Roosevelts first term and he won re-election in 1936, in one of the most lopsided victories in American history.\\nDespite the popularity of the New Deal among supporters of Roosevelt, from 1936 onwards, New Deal legislation was frequently struck down by the US Supreme Court, which maintained a conservative bent. The dispute between Roosevelt and the Court resulted in Roosevelt lobbying for the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937 or court packing plan, which would have expanded the size of the Supreme Court. The bill was blocked by the newly formed bipartisan Conservative Coalition, which also sought to prevent further New Deal legislation. During the recession of 19371938, Roosevelt launched a rhetorical campaign against big business and monopoly power in the United States. Other major 1930s legislation and agencies implemented under Roosevelt include the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Labor Relations Act, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Social Security, and the Fair Labor Standards Act.\\nRoosevelt was re-elected in 1940 for his third term, making him the only U.S. president to serve for more than two terms. By 1939 another World War was on the horizon which prompted the United States to respond by passing a series of laws affirming neutrality and rejecting intervention. Despite this, President Roosevelt gave strong diplomatic and financial support to China, the United Kingdom, and eventually the Soviet Union. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, an event he called a date which will live in infamy, Roosevelt obtained a congressional declaration of war against Japan. On December 11 Japans allies, Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy declared war on the United States. In response, the US formally joined the Allies and entered the European theater of war. Assisted by his top aide Harry Hopkins and with very strong national support, he worked closely with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Soviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin, and Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in leading the Allied Powers against the Axis Powers. Roosevelt supervised the mobilization of the U.S. economy to support the war effort and implemented a Europe first strategy, initiating the Lend-Lease program and making the defeat of Germany first a priority over that of Japan. Domestically, his administration co-ordinated massive wartime efforts such as the construction of the Pentagon and the Manhattan Project, which saw the creation of the atomic bomb. His foreign policy mirrored Wilsonian ideals which prompted Roosevelt to make his highest postwar priority being the establishment of the United Nations. Roosevelt expected the United Nations to replace the now defunct League of Nations and to be led by Washington, Moscow, London, and Nanjing. These states collectively called the Big Four would work to resolve all major world problems. It was under his wartime leadership that the United States became a superpower on the world stage.Roosevelt won re-election in the 1944 presidential election on his post-war recovery platform. His physical health began declining during the later war years, and less than three months into his fourth term, Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945. Vice President Harry S. Truman assumed office as president and oversaw the acceptance of surrender by the Axis powers. Since his death, several of Roosevelts actions have come under substantial criticism, such as the relocation and internment of Japanese Americans in concentration camps. Nevertheless, he is consistently ranked by scholars, political scientists and historians as one of the greatest presidents in American history.\\n\\n"

Scott Fitzgerald, Sinclair Lewis, Ezra Pound, Sherwood Anderson and Henri Matisse, would meet.In 1933, Stein published a quasi-memoir of her Paris years, The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, written in the voice of Alice B. Toklas, her life partner. The book became a literary bestseller and vaulted Stein from the relative obscurity of the cult-literature scene into the limelight of mainstream attention. Two quotes from her works have become widely known: Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose, and there is no there there, with the latter often taken to be a reference to her childhood home of Oakland.\\nHer books include Q.E.D. 1903, about a lesbian romantic affair involving several of Steins friends; Fernhurst, a fictional story about a love triangle; Three Lives 190506; The Making of Americans 19021911; and Tender Buttons 1914.\\nHer activities during World War II have been the subject of analysis and commentary. As a Jew living in Nazi-occupied France, Stein may have only been able to sustain her lifestyle as an art collector, and indeed to ensure her physical safety, through the protection of the powerful Vichy government official and Nazi collaborator Bernard Fa. After the war ended, Stein expressed admiration for another Nazi collaborator, Vichy leader Marshal Ptain."

The first season was released on Netflix on March 20, 2020.

The series focuses on the small but deeply interconnected society of big cat conservationists such as Carole Baskin, owner of Big Cat Rescue, and collectors such as Exotic, whom Baskin accuses of abusing and exploiting wild animals.\\nSeason 1 received positive reviews from critics, and according to Nielsen ratings, was watched by 34.3 million people over its first ten days of release, ranking as one of Netflixs most successful releases to date, partly due to its release amid the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, and also inspired several memes online. Despite its success and popularity, the season received criticism from conservation and animal rights groups for its framing and inaccuracies related to private breeding and wildlife conservation issues. A special aftershow hosted by Joel McHale was released on April 12, 2020, with McHale interviewing several of its subjects about Exotic and the series itself. The second and third seasons in contrast received mostly negative reviews from fans and critics, and the former was subject of a lawsuit by Carole and Howard Baskin over footage used in the series. There is no indication there will be another season."

It was first released in North America in 2008, and then in Europe the following year.\\nPong Toss has had a substantially negative reaction from critics by critics; it holds an aggregate score of 18/100 on Metacritic. One common complaint was its controls, which critics found cumbersome. It received negative reception from parents, activist groups, and Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal over its premise before its release due to its connection to alcohol as well as what they considered a lax Entertainment Software Rating Board ESRB content rating. In response, JV Games removed references to drinking alcohol from the game and its title, which caused the ESRB to lower the content rating.

Laura, originally played by Stacey Baldwin, was introduced in 1974 as the illegitimate daughter of Lesley Webber Denise Alexander. The character was written out in the summer of 1976. In early 1977, Genie Francis took over the role of the rebellious teenage Laura. In 1978, thanks to the efforts of executive producer Gloria Montys plan to entice younger viewers, the characters popularity skyrocketed in the late 1970s and early 1980s due to her pairings with Scott Baldwin Kin Shriner and, most famously, Luke Spencer Anthony Geary; the latter became a popular supercouple among soap opera fans and viewers. Luke and Lauras 1981 wedding which featured a guest appearance from Elizabeth Taylor was viewed by 30 million people. In 1981, Francis quit the show, claiming unequal treatment compared to Geary, and the character was written out as having disappeared the following January. Francis returned for a brief stint in late 1983 to reunite Luke and Laura, and then again in late 1984 when Laura was revealed to be pregnant.\\nIn 1993, Laura was re-introduced by producer Wendy Riche, along with Luke and their young son Lucky Spencer Jonathan Jackson. Their stories consisted of their struggle to hide from mobster Frank Smith, the 1994 birth of their daughter Lulu Spencer and the introduction of Lauras illegitimate son Nikolas Cassadine Tyler Christopher, who comes to town to save an ailing Lulu. Francis quit the series in 2002, and Laura was written out after suffering a psychotic breakdown, after believing to have killed her adoptive father Rick Webber Chris Robinson. Francis returned in 2006 to celebrate Luke and Lauras 25th wedding anniversary. The return stint, which only lasted a month, featured Lauras reunions with her children, Nikolas, Lucky Greg Vaughan, and Lulu Julie Marie Berman, and Lauras renewal of her wedding vows with Luke on their anniversary date. The return garnered Francis the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series. Francis returned to the series again in 2008 to help Lulu, who had also been institutionalized. In 2013, in honor of the shows 50th anniversary celebration, Francis reprised the role of Laura when the writers revisited the iconic Ice Princess plot, and Laura was briefly remarried to Scott. Although initial reports said the actress would stick around, Francis left the role again that August. Francis returned to the series in 2015, this time as part of Lukes exit storyline. Francis later signed a deal for her to remain with the series indefinitely."

            "Hunting",
            "Hunting, Hunting is the human practice of seeking, pursuing, capturing, or killing wildlife or feral animals. The most common reasons for humans to hunt are to harvest food i.e. meat and useful animal products fur/hide, bone/tusks, horn/antler, etc., for recreation/taxidermy see trophy hunting, to remove predators dangerous to humans or domestic animals e.g. wolf hunting, to eliminate pests and nuisance animals that damage crops/livestock/poultry or spread diseases see varminting, for trade/tourism see safari, or for ecological conservation against overpopulation and invasive species.\\nRecreationally hunted species are generally referred to as the game, and are usually mammals and birds. A person participating in a hunt is a hunter or less commonly huntsman; a natural area used for hunting is called a game reserve; an experienced hunter who helps organize a hunt and/or manage the game reserve is known as a gamekeeper.\\nMany non-human animals also hunt see predation as part of their feeding and parental behaviors, sometimes in quantities exceeding immediate dietary needs. The one that does the hunting is the predator, and the one being hunted is the prey.\\n\\nHunting activities by humans arose in Homo erectus or earlier, in the order of millions of years ago. Hunting has become deeply embedded in various human cultures and was once an important part of the rural economiesclassified by economists as part of primary production alongside forestry, agriculture and fishery. Modern regulations see game law distinguish lawful hunting activities from illegal poaching, which involves the unauthorized and unregulated killing, trapping or capture of animals.\\n\\nApart from food provision, hunting can be a means of population control. Hunting advocates state that regulated hunting can be a necessary component of modern wildlife management, for example to help maintain a healthy proportion of animal populations within an environments ecological carrying capacity when natural checks such as natural predators are absent or insufficient, or to provide funding for breeding programs and maintenance of natural reserves and conservation parks. However, excessive hunting has also heavily contributed to the endangerment, extirpation and extinction of many animals. Some animal rights and anti-hunting activists regard hunting as a cruel, perverse and unnecessary blood sport. Certain hunting practices, such as canned hunts and ludicrously paid/bribed trophy tours especially to poor countries, are considered unethical and exploitative even by some hunters.\\n\\nMarine mammals such as whales and pinnipeds are also targets of hunting, both recreationally and commercially, often with heated controversies regarding the morality, ethics and legality of such practices. The pursuit, harvesting or catch and release of fish and aquatic cephalopods and crustaceans is called fishing, which however is widely accepted and not commonly categorised as a form of hunting, even though it essentially is. It is also not considered hunting to pursue animals without intent to kill them, as in wildlife photography, birdwatching, or scientific-research activities which involve tranquilizing or tagging of animals, although green hunting is still called so. The practices of netting or trapping insects and other arthropods for trophy collection, or the foraging or gathering of plants and mushrooms, are also not regarded as hunting.\\n\\nSkillful tracking and acquisition of an elusive target has caused the word hunt to be used in the vernacular as a metaphor for searching and obtaining something, as in treasure hunting, bargain hunting, hunting for votes and even hunting down corruption and waste."

In the context of traditional Chinese tea production terminology, fermentation refers to microbial fermentation called wet piling, and is typically applied after the tea leaves have been sufficiently dried and rolled. As the tea undergoes controlled microbial fermentation, it also continues to oxidize, which is also controlled, until the desired flavors are reached. This process produces tea known as hich lit. black tea which is different from the English-language black tea that is called hngch lit. red tea in Chinese. Puer falls under a larger category of fermented teas commonly translated as dark teas.\\nTwo main styles of puer production exist: a traditional, longer production process known as shng raw puer; and a modern, accelerated production process known as shu ripe puer. Puer traditionally begins with a raw product called rough mo ch , lit. fuzzy/furry tea and can be sold in this form or pressed into a number of shapes and sold as shng ch , lit. raw tea. Both of these forms then undergo the complex process of gradual fermentation and maturation with time. The wdu fermentation process developed in 1973 by the Kunming Tea Factory created a new type of puer tea. This process involves an accelerated fermentation into shu or sh ch , lit. ripe tea that is then stored loose or pressed into various shapes. The fermentation process was adopted at the Menghai Tea Factory shortly after and technically developed there. The legitimacy of shu ch is disputed by some traditionalists when compared to the traditionally, longer-aged teas, such as shng ch. \\nPuer can be stored and permitted to age and to mature, like wine, in non-airtight containers before consumption. This is why it has long been standard practice to label all types of puer with the year and region of production."

            "Western world, The Western world, also known as the West, primarily refers to the various nations and states in the regions of Europe, North America, and Oceania. The Western world is also known as the Occident from the Latin word occidns setting down, sunset, west in contrast to the Eastern world known as the Orient from the Latin word orins origin, sunrise, east. Following the Discovery of America in 1492, the West came to be known as the world of business and trade; and might also mean the Northern half of the NorthSouth divide, the countries of the Global North often equated with capitalist developed countries.\\n\\nModern-day Western world encompasses much of the nations and states where civilizationis based on the Western culturerooted in the ancient Greco-Roman world. A theological concept of the West emerged in the aftermath of 1054 EastWest Schism of the Western Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. The contemporary Western world is politically rooted in the revolutionary fervour of the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in much of Europe and the Americas; the following twentieth century saw populist dictatorships in Europe leading to two World Wars with the aftermath of the Cold War, which led to the formation of the Western Bloc that adopted the model of liberal democracy with capitalist and free market economy. The West is also known for its gendered identities, and various antireligious sentiments; following the Age of Enlightenment and the French Revolution, inquisitions were abolished in the 19th and 20th centuries, leading to separation of church and state, and the establishment of secular states.\\nHome to an array of diverse people in present-day, many countries in the West were once envisioned as homelands for whites. Women in the West are considered as the liberated, independent subjects that women from other cultures are yet to become. Feminism is often criticized for being inherently white and western.\\nThe transition from 1800s industrialization to 1900s mass production, consumerism and computing revolution was trailed with a fundamental shift from physical to intellectual labor, permitting the 1960s-80s development of revolution in gender roles and providing an irreligious but more woman-centered Western world after former male-dominancy.Used to develop national identities, the overarching concept of the West was forged in opposition to ideas such as the East, the Orient, Eastern barbarism, Oriental despotism, or the Asiatic mode of production by Karl Marx. Depending on the context and the historical period in question, Russia has sometimes been seen as a part of the West, and at other times, juxtaposed with it. Transformed from a directional concept to a socio-political concept and with the backdrop of the perception of an increasing acceleration of time, the idea of the West was temporalized and rendered as a concept of the future German: Zukunftsbegriff bestowed with notions of progress and modernity.Running parallel to the rise of the United States as a great power, and the development of communication and transportation technologies shrinking the distance between both the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, the aforementioned country became more prominently featured in conceptualizations of the West. In modern usage, the term Western world sometimes refers to Europe and to areas whose populations have large presence of European ethnic groups since the 15th century Age of Discovery. This is most evident by the inclusion of Australia and New Zealand in the modern definitions of the Western world: despite being part of the South Seas of the Eastern Hemisphere; these regions and those like it are included due to its significant British influence deriving from the colonisation of British explorers and the immigration of Europeans in the 20th century which has since grounded both the countries to the Western world politically and culturally.\\n\\n"

It stars Craig Sheffer, Anne Bobby, David Cronenberg, Charles Haid, Hugh Quarshie, and Doug Bradley. The film follows an unstable mental patient named Aaron Boone who is falsely led to believe by his doctor that he is a serial killer. Tracked down by the police, his doctor, and his girlfriend Lori, Boone eventually finds refuge in an abandoned cemetery called Midian among a tribe of monsters and outcasts known as the Nightbreed who hide from humanity.\\nAt the time of its release, the film was a commercial and critical failure. In several interviews, Barker protested that the film company tried to sell it as a standard slasher film, and that the powers-that-be had no real working knowledge of Nightbreeds story. Since its initial theatrical release, Nightbreed has become a cult film.Over time, Barker expressed disappointment with the final cut approved by the studio and always longed for the recovery of the reels so the film might be re-edited. In 2014, original film elements for the cut material were re-obtained and were edited into a directors cut, released through Scream Factory."

It follows college sophomore Jadusable, who, after acquiring a haunted Nintendo 64 video game cartridge of Majoras Mask, is plagued over the course of a single week by the presence of a seemingly omniscient being called BEN. The second arc, titled Moon Children and taking place from late 2010 to early 2011, follows the public emergence of a mysterious cult known as The Moon Children, who worshipped the Moon by way of human sacrifice, or in their words, ascension. The third arc, titled Awakening, began in March 2020, following new and returning characters who have become involved in multiple events of the current year. This arc introduced new scenarios detailing the aftermath of an in-universe event in 2018 that caused the collapse of civilized society, as well as continuing stories established in the previous arcs with the intent of tying them together.\\nThe series is one of the most popular web serials on the internet, with a viewership in the hundreds of thousands, and has been widely recognized as both an example of a modern urban legend and a major influence in helping to establish and legitimize creepypasta as a literary genre, creating many of the recognizable tropes that are now seen today in modern internet horror stories."

The term is a neologism combination of two Chinese characters: f Chinese: , meaning Buddha; and x Chinese: , meaning series or school. Young people who uphold the Buddha-like mindset are referred to as Buddha-like youths Chinese: or Generation Zen.The term originated in a 2014 issue of the Japanese womens fashion magazine Non-no to refer to Japanese men who had progressed from being herbivore men to being monk-like men who consider it too exhausting to even bother interacting with women and enjoy being by themselves. The term has been also applied to numerous areas such as parenting, employment, online shopping, fandom, dating and interpersonal relationships. Although the word is inspired by the Buddhist doctrine of becoming spiritually satisfied through giving up anything tied to avarice, it is not a Buddhist principle.\\nThe Buddha-like label is primarily adopted by young Chinese men from the post-90s and post-00s generations referring to their less-than-optimistic life outlook, although some post-80s experiencing quarter life crises also admit subscribing to the mindset. Stressed out by poor job prospects, decreased life satisfaction, increasingly stagnant social mobility, disappointing romantic life, familial complications of the one-child policy and soaring housing prices, youths have adopted the term to maintain their fortitude and as a backlash against societys high expectations. For example, the adherents of Buddha-like parenting would say that there are not that many kids who will really amount to much, so why give them an exhausting childhood? Advertisers have also used the term to market their products. In the technology industry, the Buddha-like mindset is seen as promoting worklife balance and thus the polar opposite of the 996 working hour system. The Buddha-like mindset has been compared to the sang and diaosi subcultures in being a softer, more moderate instance of counterculture.\\nThe term gained attention on 11 December 2017, when the WeChat account Xin Shixiang Chinese: , New World Scenes, which is operated by a media company, posted an article titled The first group of post-90s generation who have become monks Chinese: 90. The article went viral and led to the terms widespread adoption in Chinese society as youth consider it in vogue. It summarised the Buddha-like mindset as Its okay to have, and its okay not to have; no competition, no fight, no winning or losing. The Chinese Communist Party has denounced the mindset as being unproductive, unpatriotic and possibly becoming an impediment to the countrys ambition of becoming a superpower. Proponents have praised the mindset as relieving youths stress and reducing resentments."

Fridman is the co-founder of LetterOne, an international investment business, and first publicized the idea in early 2016. The word indigo was initially chosen based on the term indigo children, which has been used to describe people with unusual and innovative abilities.\\nFridman describes the Indigo Era as a disruptive era driven by extraordinary levels of human creativity, where abnormally talented individuals and entities are able to realize new levels of human potential and economic achievement. It is a new economic era where the main source of national wealth is no longer resource rent but the socio-economic infrastructure that allows every person to realise his or her intellectual or creative potential. But, according to Fridman based on his observations of recent economic indicators, political and market volatility, and historical patterns it is also an era that will generate winners and losers as lagging countries and groups fail to adapt quickly enough.\\nIn late 2016 LetterOnes Global Perspectives journal published an Indigo Index, ranking 152 countries on their ability to compete and grow as economies move away from being powered by natural resources to being powered by ideas, creativity, and digital skills. In 2017 it launched the Indigo Prize, to award new concepts of economic measurement beyond mere GDP as countries in the 21st century transition into economies where innovation, creativity, and digital skills are economic drivers. The competition is intended to stimulate debate about factors currently measured, given evolving economies, technology and skill bases, and what should now be taken into consideration in official economic statistics that measure the health, size and growth of a modern economy."

Very broadly, it dates to between 50,000 and 12,000 years ago the beginning of the Holocene, according to some theories coinciding with the appearance of behavioral modernity in early modern humans, until the advent of the Neolithic Revolution and agriculture.\\nAnatomically modern humans i.e. Homo sapiens are believed to have emerged in Africa around 300,000 years ago, it has been argued by some that their ways of life changed relatively little from that of archaic humans of the Middle Paleolithic, until about 50,000 years ago, when there was a marked increase in the diversity of artefacts found associated with modern human remains.\\nThis period coincides with the most common date assigned to expansion of modern humans from Africa throughout Asia and Eurasia, which contributed to the extinction of the Neanderthals.\\nThe Upper Paleolithic has the earliest known evidence of organized settlements, in the form of campsites, some with storage pits. Artistic work blossomed, with cave painting, petroglyphs, carvings and engravings on bone or ivory. The first evidence of human fishing is also found, from artefacts in places such as Blombos cave in South Africa. More complex social groupings emerged, supported by more varied and reliable food sources and specialized tool types.

It was later ported to other home computers and consoles. The goal of the game varies per level but usually revolves around bringing at least one of the player-controlled humans to the designated end area marked by a colored tile. Doing this requires players taking advantage of the tribes ability to build a human ladder and use tools such as spears, torches, wheels, ropes and a witch doctor in later levels.\\nThe Humans was conceived by Rodney Humble during his time working with Imagitec Design as a project for the Atari Lynx spawning a trilogy based upon the human evolution inspired by Psygnosis Lemmings, creating and drawing his ideas before transferring the design work to Imagitec programmers in developing them further, serving as the first game to be published by MicroProse offshoot Mirage, while Atari Corporation liked the title and commissioned two additional conversions for their platforms.\\nThe Humans was very well received by video game magazines and garnered praise for the originality, presentation and audio upon its initial Amiga launch. Other versions of the game have been met with a more mixed reception from critics and reviewers alike. It was followed by three sequels: The Humans: Insult to Injury in 1992, Humans 3: Evolution - Lost in Time in 1995, and The Humans: Meet the Ancestors! in 2009."

The twenty-one sketches were published in a collection entitled The Clockmaker or, also known as, the Sayings and Doings of Samuel Slick of Slicksville First Series in 1836 and supplemented by an additional 12 unpublished or new sketches. The book was Canadas first international bestseller and was hugely popular not only in Nova Scotia, but also in Britain and the United States.\\nSlicks wise-cracking commentary on the colonial life of Nova Scotia and relations with the U.S. and Britain struck a note with readers, which lead to a second series in 1838 and a third in 1840. The satirical sketches, mocking both Canadians and Americans, made Haliburton one of the most popular writers of comic fiction in English of that era. The Clockmaker, which was also translated into German, established Haliburton as one of the founders of North American humour. As Arthur Scobie notes in The Canadian Encyclopedia, The Clockmaker stories, proved immensely popular and, ironically, have influenced American humour as much as Canadian."

The original Folk Theorem concerned the payoffs of all the Nash equilibria of an infinitely repeated game. This result was called the Folk Theorem because it was widely known among game theorists in the 1950s, even though no one had published it. Friedmans 1971 Theorem concerns the payoffs of certain subgame-perfect Nash equilibria SPE of an infinitely repeated game, and so strengthens the original Folk Theorem by using a stronger equilibrium concept: subgame-perfect Nash equilibria rather than Nash equilibria.The Folk Theorem suggests that if the players are patient enough and far-sighted i.e. if the discount factor \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  1\\n  \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle \\\\delta \\\\to 1}\\n , then repeated interaction can result in virtually any average payoff in an SPE equilibrium. Virtually any is here technically defined as feasible and individually rational.\\nFor example, in the one-shot Prisoners Dilemma, both players cooperating is not a Nash equilibrium. The only Nash equilibrium is that both players defect, which is also a mutual minmax profile. One folk theorem says that, in the infinitely repeated version of the game, provided players are sufficiently patient, there is a Nash equilibrium such that both players cooperate on the equilibrium path. But if the game is repeated a known finite number of times, backward induction shows that both players will play the one-shot Nash equilibrium in each period, i.e. they will defect each time."

Ethan is a Specialist registrar in emergency medicine and is an excellent medic who had worked hard to achieve his position in the profession. He is characterised as a shy, socially awkward person with a serious and attentive attitude. Throughout his inclusion in the show Ethan has shared an on-screen friendship with like minded Lily Chao Crystal Yu. He has had romantic stories alongside the character Honey Wright Chelsee Healey.

Writers created more romance for Ethan with Cals girlfriend Alicia Munroe Chelsea Halfpenny, their affair causes a sibling feud. When Winsor departed the show in 2017, Cal was murdered by Scott Ellisson Will Austin. Writers used the incident to create a story of revenge and unethical behaviour to coincide with Ethans grief. Ethans morals were permanently compromised when he allows Scott to die under the hospitals care. Writers continued to portray Ethan as unethical through romance stories with his patients Leigh-Anne Carr Cassie Bradley and Effie Laurence Abigail Hardingham. In 2019, producers gave Rainsford a posttraumatic stress disorder story to portray. Ethan is involved in an explosion which kills a colleague. Survivors guilt and stress lead Ethan into yet more unethical behaviour.\\nOther stories include Ethan being involved in a mini-bus crash, being promoted to clinical lead and becoming disillusioned with the NHS system over-working staff. For his portrayal of Ethan, Rainsford won Best Drama Star at the 2017 Inside Soap awards. Ethan has generally been well received by critics of the genre. In 2020, Emma Bullimore from the Radio Times stated that Ethan had become one of the shows best characters from the shows entire duration; Robert Hiley from Whats on TV branded Ethan a brilliant character.\\nIn November 2022, it was confirmed that Ethan Hardy would be leaving Casualty, with actor Rainsford leaving the role after nine years on the program.

The character was introduced alongside his twin brother David Tanaka Takaya Honda, and they arrive in Erinsborough to find their long-lost biological father. Both Kano and Honda auditioned for both Tanaka roles and were later awarded their respective parts. The shows producer Jason Herbison had planned their stories months in advance. The shows writing team meticulously researched the shows history to find a way to introduce the two characters into the shows long-standing Robinson family. Leo and Davids search ended in the revelation that the shows villainous character, Paul Robinson Stefan Dennis was their father.\\nLeo is characterised as a flirtatious and charming businessman who takes entrepreneurial risks. He is portrayed as both ruthless and driven, which Kano believed was his characters personality flaw. He thought Leo was an interesting addition to the Neighbours cast because his attitude clashes with the shows moralistic female residents. Leos stories have focused on business decisions and romance. He arrives in Erinsborough to start a new business. Despite a history in bar management he decides to open a new hostel for backpackers. Romance stories feature a near incestuous relationship with his half-sister Amy Williams Zoe Cramond and more prominent relationships with Mishti Sharma Scarlet Vas and Terese Willis Rebekah Elmaloglou. \\nOther storylines include Leo getting crushed under concrete, feuds with other characters, and Kano filming overseas in London. Leo and Amys near romance attracted some media attention, with Alex McCarthy from TV Week branding it awkward and a Metro reporter viewing it as gross. In 2019, Kanos management confirmed he would be leaving the serial and he filmed his final scenes in June. Leos departure aired on 10 September 2019, but he made a guest appearance from 11 December 2019 to 1 January 2020.

His return storyline sees his ex-girlfriend, Britney Barnes Montana Cox, give birth to Leos daughter. Kanos last appearance is in the final episode of the show, which aired on 28 July 2022."

            "Alex Bennett Home and Away, Alex Bennett is a fictional character from the Australian television soap opera Home and Away, played by Nick Freedman. The serials producers thought of Freedman for the role of easy-going hippy Alex, having seen his previous work in other television dramas. Freedman was hesitant about accepting the role due to his career as a musician, so he only signed a year-long contract. He found the demands of filming the weekly serial intense, especially as he was used to late nights while performing with his band. He made his first appearance during the episode broadcast on 16 October 1995.\\nIn addition to his hippy ways, Alex was portrayed as laid-back and a real romantic at heart. Freedman said he was a good guy, who had endured a difficult childhood and had become a bit of a drifter. Alex is a cartoonist and painter, who becomes a have-a-go hero when he saves Shannon Reed Isla Fisher and Selina Cook Tempany Deckert from a group of youths. He later saves Selina from his fathers religious cult. Writers soon established a romantic relationship between Alex and Shannon, as they share the same interests and outlook on life. Fisher thought that viewers could resonate with the couple, as Shannon was vulnerable, while Alex was gentle and submissive. Fisher and Freedmans height difference caused difficulty while filming their romantic scenes. Freedman also disliked the writing for the couple and tried to make his characters position in the relationship more realistic. On-screen, the age gap between Alex and Shannon causes issues for them, and they briefly break-up after a big argument.\\nThe character was used to explore the effects of temporary blindness and brain injury, after a grenade explodes in his face. The incident seriously challenges Alexs relationship with Shannon, as he experiences personality changes. He kisses another woman and almost causes Angel Parrishs Melissa George daughter to drown. His strange behaviour also sees him accused of raping Chloe Richards Kristy Wright and he is later seen with Chloes bracelet, which convinces Shannon and the Bays residents of his guilt. After the real culprit is caught, Alex reconsiders his future in the Bay and decides to move to Paris. Off-screen, Freedman rejected a new contract with the show in order to pursue his music career. His final scenes aired on 16 August 1996."

It represents the first advanced and distinctively Greek civilization in mainland Greece with its palatial states, urban organization, works of art, and writing system. The Mycenaeans were mainland Greek peoples who were likely stimulated by their contact with insular Minoan Crete and other Mediterranean cultures to develop a more sophisticated sociopolitical culture of their own. The most prominent site was Mycenae, after which the culture of this era is named. Other centers of power that emerged included Pylos, Tiryns, Midea in the Peloponnese, Orchomenos, Thebes, Athens in Central Greece and Iolcos in Thessaly. Mycenaean settlements also appeared in Epirus, Macedonia, on islands in the Aegean Sea, on the south-west coast of Asia Minor, Cyprus, while Mycenaean-influenced settlements appeared in the Levant, and Italy.The Mycenaean Greeks introduced several innovations in the fields of engineering, architecture and military infrastructure, while trade over vast areas of the Mediterranean was essential for the Mycenaean economy. Their syllabic script, the Linear B, offers the first written records of the Indo-European Greek language, and their religion already included several deities that can also be found in the Olympic Pantheon. Mycenaean Greece was dominated by a warrior elite society and consisted of a network of palace-centered states that developed rigid hierarchical, political, social and economic systems. At the head of this society was the king, known as a wanax.\\nMycenaean Greece perished with the collapse of Bronze Age culture in the eastern Mediterranean, to be followed by the Greek Dark Ages, a recordless transitional period leading to Archaic Greece where significant shifts occurred from palace-centralized to de-centralized forms of socio-economic organization including the extensive use of iron. Various theories have been proposed for the end of this civilization, among them the Dorian invasion or activities connected to the Sea Peoples. Additional theories such as natural disasters and climatic changes have also been suggested. The Mycenaean period became the historical setting of much ancient Greek literature and mythology, including the Trojan Epic Cycle."

Because of childhood trauma, she has developed a competitive and outgoing character, to get noticed by other people and affirm her own self. In the Rebuild of Evangelion films, her Japanese surname is changed to Shikinami and she differs significantly in her background and characterization from her TV series incarnation.\\nSeries creator and director Hideaki Anno originally proposed her as the main protagonist of the series. Character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto asked Anno to include a male main character instead, downgrading her to the role of co-protagonist with Shinji Ikari. Anno based her psychology on his personality, bringing his moods into the character, acting instinctively and without having thought about how the character would evolve. During the first broadcast of the series, he changed his plans, creating an evolutionary parable in which Asuka becomes more dramatic and suffers, intentionally going against the expectations of the fans. The Japanese voice actress Miyamura was also influential, deciding some details and some of Asukas lines.\\nAsuka maintained a high ranking in every popularity poll of the series and has appeared in surveys to decide the most popular anime characters in Japan. Merchandising based on her has also been released, particularly action figures, which became highly popular. Some critics took issue with her hubris and her personality, judging these as tiresome and arrogant; others appreciated the seriess realism and her complex psychological introspection. Asuka is also one of the most successful and influential examples of the tsundere stereotype, characteristic of grumpy and arrogant characters with a fragile hidden side, helping to define its characteristics."

An updated form as Genma Onimusha Japanese:  for the Xbox was released in 2002. The original Warlords version was ported to Microsoft Windows, although it was only available in China and Russia. A remaster for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One was released in 2018. A Windows version followed in 2019.\\nThe games plot is set in the Sengoku period and focuses on the samurai Samanosuke Akechi who fights against the forces of Nobunaga Oda. After Nobunagas death in battle, Samanosuke goes on a quest to save Princess Yuki from demons working alongside Nobunagas forces. The player controls Samanosuke and his partner, a female ninja Kaede, in their fight against demons.\\nWhile the game borrows elements from Capcoms own Resident Evil survival horror series, such as solving puzzles and a fixed camera, the game is focused more on the action game genre with Samanosuke possessing multiple weapons that can be upgraded by defeating several enemies. Capcom originally wanted to release the game for the original PlayStation but the close release of its next generation version resulted in the project being scrapped.\\nFollowing its release, Onimusha: Warlords achieved high popularity becoming the first PlayStation 2 game to reach one million sales. Its sales eventually surpassed two million units worldwide. The game has been well-received by video game publications and has been recognized as one of the best titles on the system. It was followed by two direct sequels for the same console and another three games within the franchise."

            "Carson bandwidth rule, In telecommunication, Carsons bandwidth rule defines the approximate bandwidth requirements of communications system components for a carrier signal that is frequency modulated by a continuous or broad spectrum of frequencies rather than a single frequency. Carsons rule does not apply well when the modulating signal contains discontinuities, such as a square wave. Carsons rule originates from John Renshaw Carsons 1922 paper.Carsons bandwidth rule is expressed by the relation:\\n\\n \\n \\n  \\n  C\\n  B\\n  R\\n  =\\n  2\\n  \\n  \\n  f\\n  +\\n  \\n   f\\n   \\n   m\\n   \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle CBR=2\\\\Delta f+f_{m}}\\n \\nwhere:\\n\\n \\n \\n  \\n  C\\n  B\\n  R\\n  \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle CBR}\\n is the bandwidth requirement;\\n\\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  f\\n  \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle \\\\Delta f}\\n is the peak frequency deviation;\\n\\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n   f\\n   \\n   m\\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle f_{m}}\\n is the highest frequency in the modulating signal.For example, a typical VHF/UHF two-way radio signal using FM mode, with 5 kHz peak deviation, and a maximum audio frequency of 3 kHz, would require an approximate bandwidth of 2 * 5kHz + 3kHz = 16 kHz.\\nStandard broadcast stereo FM, with a peak deviation of 75 kHz, has a highest modulating frequency which combines L+R and L-R of 53 kHz. Most of the energy therefore falls within an approximate bandwidth of 2 * 75 + 53 = 256 kHz. Geographically close FM broadcast transmitters are almost always assigned nominal center frequencies at least 400 kHz apart.\\nCarsons bandwidth rule is often applied to transmitters, antennas, optical sources, receivers, photodetectors, and other communications system components.\\nAny frequency modulated signal will have an infinite number of sidebands and hence an infinite bandwidth but, in practice, all significant sideband energy 98% or more is concentrated within the bandwidth defined by Carsons rule. It is a useful approximation, but setting the arbitrary definition of occupied bandwidth at 98% of the power still means that the power outside the band is about \\n \\n \\n  \\n  10\\n  log\\n  \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n    0.98\\n    0.02\\n   \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n  17\\n  \\n  \\n   d\\n   B\\n  \\n  \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle 10\\\\log \\\\left{\\\\frac {0.98}{0.02}}\\\\right\\\\approx 17\\\\;\\\\mathrm {dB} }\\n less than the carrier inside, therefore Carsons Rule is of little use in spectrum planning.\\n\\n"

The character debuted on 9 November 1998 and became one of the shows central protagonists until he was killed-off on 25 December 2002.\\nDuring his time on the programme, Jamies story arc mostly revolved on his close relationships with his godfather Phil Mitchell Steve McFadden and on-off girlfriend Sonia Jackson Natalie Cassidy. The character was originally Phils second cousin once removed, but later became his surrogate son after it transpired that Jamie had been regularly abused by uncle and guardian Billy Perry Fenwick who himself debuted on the show a week before Jamies first appearance. Elsewhere, Jamies romance with Sonia faced many complications ever since she gave birth to Chloe Jade Sharif at the age of 15; Jamie always knew he was never the father of Sonias child and never knew who the father was, until it was revealed that his friend, Martin Fowler James Alexandrou, was actually Chloes father after they had a previous one night stand prior to her dating Jamie.\\nAs such, Jamie was involved in some highly-profiled storylines that his family were often involved in. This includes Jamie getting protection from Phil and his brother Grant Ross Kemp when Billy ends up moving into the square; nursing Phil back to health after his criminal job with Grant ended with the Mitchell Brothers plunging their getaway car in the River Thames; losing his virginity to Phils troublesome stepsister Janine Charlie Brooks before his romance with Sonia emerged; sparking friendships with both Sonias brother Robbie Dean Gaffney and Phils employee Garry Hobbs Ricky Groves; temporarily dating Sonias neighbour Zoe Slater Michelle Ryan after their relationship nearly collapses; getting embroiled in feuds with Phils two archenemies, Steve Owen Martin Kemp and Dan Sullivan Craig Fairbrass, that escalated in the Who Shot Phil? scenario; clashing with both Steves widow Mel Healy Tamzin Outhwaite and Martins older brother Mark Todd Carty over the circumstances behind Phils shooting; comforting Phil and Grants sister Sam Kim Medcalf over her failed relationship with Billys sworn nemesis Trevor Morgan Alex Ferns; and helping reclaim the stolen purse that belonged to Phils mother Peggy Barbara Windsor.\\nIn the follow-up of Who Shot Phil? and its aftermath, Jamies conflict with Billy improves after the source behind their hostility was disclosed due to Billy having been previously abused in orphanage. At the same time, however, Jamies relationship with Phil deteriorates after he helps his former girlfriend Lisa Shaw Lucy Benjamin escape to Portugal with their daughter Louise. This resulted in Phil beating Jamie up in October 2002, a moment that issued thirty-one complaints to the Broadcasting Standards Commission. Two months later, the characters exit was presented when Jamie after getting engaged to Sonia is hospitalized after Martin runs him over in his car; Jamie consequently spends his last days in hospital until he eventually dies of spleen damage on Christmas Day.\\nWhen Ryder decided to quit his role, executive producer John Yorke said that the door would be left open for Jamie to return. This was later overturned when Yorke was succeeded by Louise Berridge, who made the choice to kill Jamie off. The decision was highly criticized, and Ryder said it was a shock for him though he stated that if he had not been killed off, he would not have returned anyway. In 1999, Ryder was nominated three times for Best Newcomer and for his exit storyline was nominated for Best Exit in 2003 at The British Soap Awards."

She is the Captains yeoman on board the USS Enterprise NCC-1701, and first appeared in the episode The Man Trap. She had significant roles in the episodes The Enemy Within, where she fights off an evil version of Captain James T. Kirk; Charlie X where a young man with god-like powers falls in love with her; and Miri where she is infected with a deadly disease while on an away mission and is kidnapped by jealous children.\\nRand was portrayed by American actress Grace Lee Whitney, who had previously worked with Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry in both The Lieutenant and a pilot for a show he created called Police Story. Whitney as Rand was involved in promoting Star Trek before it aired, but did not appear in the first two pilots. Roddenberry set out the role of Rand to Whitney, saying that she and Kirk were meant to have feelings for one another, but should never act on them. Part way through the first season, Whitney was released from her contract. The official explanation was that the production team wanted to free up Kirk to have relationships with other women, but it was actually necessitated because the series was over budget and was looking to cut costs. It is unclear who suggested that her contract should be terminated, or who made the final decision. Roddenberry later blamed NBC for her release and said he regretted it.\\nAfter Whitney was reintroduced to Star Trek through conventions, she came back into contact with Roddenberry, who wanted to include her in the new series in development at the time, Star Trek: Phase II. This was subsequently cancelled, but Rand did reappear in Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Whitney made further appearances as Rand in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, as well as scenes in the Star Trek: Voyager episode Flashback set during the events of the latter film. Whitney made further appearances as Rand in the fan series Star Trek: New Voyages and Star Trek: Of Gods and Men, and Rand was also portrayed by Meghan King Johnson in New Voyages.\\nPrior to the start of The Original Series, Whitney was used to promote the series and was popular with the media. Critics later called the character a stereotype in her initial appearances, but the expansion of the role in Flashback was praised."

More specifically, it entails international cooperation through multilateral institutions like the United Nations, World Trade Organization and International Monetary Fund and is constituted by human equality freedom, rule of law and human rights, open markets, security cooperation, promotion of liberal democracy, and monetary cooperation. The order was established in the aftermath of World War II, led in large part by the United States.The nature of the liberal international order LIO, as well as its very existence, has been debated by scholars. The LIO has been credited with expanding free trade, increasing capital mobility, spreading democracy, promoting human rights, and collectively defending the West from the Soviet Union. The LIO facilitated unprecedented cooperation among the states of North America, Western Europe and Japan. Over time, the LIO facilitated the spread of economic liberalism to the rest of the world, as well as helped consolidate democracy in formerly fascist or communist countries.Origins of the LIO have commonly been identified as the 1940s, usually starting in 1945. with some scholars pointing to earlier agreements between the WWII-era Allies such as the Atlantic Charter in 1941. John Mearsheimer has dissented with this view, arguing that the LIO only arose after the end of the Cold War. Core founding members of the LIO include the states of North America, Western Europe and Japan; these states form a security community. The characteristics of the LIO have varied over time. Some scholars refer to a Cold War variation of the LIO largely limited to the West, and a post-Cold War variation having a more widespread scope and giving international institutions more powers.Aspects of the LIO are challenged internally within liberal states by populism, protectionism and nativism. Scholars have argued that embedded liberalism or the logics inherent in the Double Movement are key to maintaining public support for the planks of the LIO; some scholars have raised questions whether aspects of embedded liberalism have been undermined, thus leading to a backlash against the LIO.Externally, the LIO is challenged by authoritarian states, illiberal states, and states that are discontented with their roles in world politics. China, Russia, Iran and North Korea have been characterized as prominent challengers to the LIO. Some scholars have argued that the LIO contains self-undermining aspects that could trigger backlash or collapse."

It is an intentional distraction or obfuscation.\\nAs a Chewbacca defense distracts and misleads, it is an example of a red herring. It is also an example of an irrelevant conclusion, a type of informal fallacy in which one making an argument fails to address the issue in question. Often an opposing counsel can legally object to such arguments by declaring them irrelevant, character evidence, or argumentative.\\nThe name Chewbacca defense comes from Chef Aid, an episode of the American animated series South Park. The episode, which premiered on October 7, 1998, satirizes the O. J. Simpson murder trial, particularly attorney Johnnie Cochrans closing argument for the defense. In the episode, Cochran bases his argument on a false premise about the 1983 film Return of the Jedi. He asks the jury why a Wookiee like Chewbacca would want to live on Endor with the much smaller Ewoks when it does not make sense. He argues that if Chewbacca living on Endor does not make senseand if even mentioning Chewbacca in the case does not make sensethen the jury must acquit.\\nIn the Simpson murder trial, the real Johnnie Cochran tried to convince jurors that a glove found at the crime scene, alleged to have been left by the killer, could not be Simpsons because it did not fit Simpsons hand. Because the prosecution relied on the glove as evidence of Simpsons presence at the scene, Cochran argued that the lack of fit proved Simpsons innocence: It makes no sense; it doesnt fit; if it doesnt fit, you must acquit. If it doesnt fit, you must acquit was a refrain that Cochran also used in response to other points of the case.\\n\\n"

It followed the Migration Period and the Germanic Iron Age. The Viking Age applies not only to their homeland of Scandinavia but also to any place significantly settled by Scandinavians during the period. The Scandinavians of the Viking Age are often referred to as Vikings as well as Norsemen, although few of them were Vikings in sense of being engaged in piracy.Voyaging by sea from their homelands in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, the Norse people settled in the British Isles, Ireland, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Greenland, Normandy, and the Baltic coast and along the Dnieper and Volga trade routes in eastern Europe, where they were also known as Varangians. They also briefly settled in Newfoundland, becoming the first Europeans to reach North America. The Norse-Gaels, Normans, Rus people, Faroese, and Icelanders emerged from these Norse colonies. The Vikings founded several kingdoms and earldoms in Europe: the kingdom of the Isles Sureyjar, Orkney Norreyjar, York Jrvk and the Danelaw Danalg, Dublin Dyflin, Normandy, and Kievan Rus Gararki. The Norse homelands were also unified into larger kingdoms during the Viking Age, and the short-lived North Sea Empire included large swathes of Scandinavia and Britain. In 1021, the Vikings achieved the feat of reaching North Americathe date of which was not specified until a millennium later.Several things drove this expansion. The Vikings were drawn by the growth of wealthy towns and monasteries overseas and weak kingdoms. They may also have been pushed to leave their homeland by overpopulation, lack of good farmland, and political strife arising from the unification of Norway. The aggressive expansion of the Carolingian Empire and forced conversion of the neighboring Saxons to Christianity may also have been a factor. Sailing innovations had allowed the Vikings to sail further and longer to begin with.\\nInformation about the Viking Age is drawn largely from primary sources written by those the Vikings encountered, as well as archaeology, supplemented with secondary sources such as the Icelandic Sagas.\\n\\n"

It was first described in his non-fiction book The War of Art and elaborated in the follow-up books Do The Work and Turning Pro, and in other essays. It is also a recurring theme in some of his fiction novels such as The Legend of Bagger Vance and The Virtues of War.Resistance is described in a mythical fashion as a universal force that has one sole mission: to keep things as they are. Pressfield claims that Resistance does not have a personal vendetta against anyone, rather it is simply trying to accomplish its only mission. It is the force that will stop an individuals creative activity through any means necessary, whether it be rationalizing, inspiring fear and anxiety, emphasizing other distractions that require attention, raising the voice of an inner critic, and much more. It will use any tool to stop creation flowing from an individual, no matter what field the creation is in.Pressfield goes on to claim that Resistance is the most dangerous element to ones life and dreams since its sole mission is to sabotage aspirations. He explains steps that human beings can take to overcome this force and keep it subdued so that they can create to their fullest potential, although Resistance is never fully gone.Pressfields concept of Resistance has been cited by authors such as Seth Godin, David M. Kelley and Tom Kelley, Eric Liu and the Lincoln Center Institute, Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, and Gina Trapani."

After the first Germans climbed up the Acropolis, an officer ordered him to surrender, give up the Greek flag and raise the Nazi swastika flag in its place. Koukidis instead supposedly chose to stay loyal to his duty by hauling down the flag, wrapping it around his body and jumping from the Acropolis rock to his death. A commemorative plaque near the spot marks the event.\\nDuring a television programme on 26 April 2000, the then mayor of Athens Dimitris Avramopoulos, stated that there was no specific documentary evidence on Koukidis or his deed. It was noted that a heroic legend of this nature had been important in maintaining national morale under a harsh occupation. On the same occasion, Lieutenant General Ioannis Kakoudakis, Director of the Department of the History of the Army, reported that an investigation had failed to confirm the existence of this soldier. The Daily Mail original article about Koukidis in 1941 as well as relevant discussion is available online."

High-resolution data of skin temperature gained by satellites in passive infrared measurements is a crucial constituent in determining the sea surface temperature SST. Since the skin layer is in radiative equilibrium with the atmosphere and the sun, its temperature underlies a daily cycle. Even small changes in the skin temperature can lead to large changes in atmospheric circulation. This makes skin temperature a widely used quantity in weather forecasting and climate science."

After World War II in Yugoslavia, Yugoslavias new leadership under Josip Broz Tito pursued a foreign policy that did not align with the interests of the Eastern Bloc. Eventually, this led to public conflict, but the Yugoslav leadership decided not to acquiesce to Soviet demands, despite significant external and internal pressures. The period saw the persecution of the political opposition in Yugoslavia, resulting in thousands being imprisoned, exiled, or sent to forced labour. 100 Yugoslav citizens were seriously wounded or killed between 1948 and 1953 while some sources claim 400 victims during the existence of Goli otok prison camp. The purges included a significant number of members of Yugoslavias security apparatus and its military.\\nThis break with the Eastern Bloc caused significant economic difficulties for Yugoslavia as the country relied on trade with the USSR and Soviet allies. Economic pressures within the country led to reforms that would ultimately result in the introduction of socialist self-management and increased decentralisation of the country through constitutional amendments formalising the reforms.\\nThe United States saw the rift between the Eastern Bloc and Yugoslavia as an opportunity during the Cold War to fragment the Eastern Bloc further and consequently provided economic and military aid, loans, and diplomatic support to the country. The new foreign policy circumstances led Tito to end Yugoslav support of Communist forces in the Greek Civil War and concluded the Balkan Pact, an agreement of cooperation and defence with Greece and Turkey.\\nThe period had an impact on Yugoslavias contemporary art and popular culture, as artists were encouraged to seek inspiration in the wartime struggle of the Yugoslav Partisans and the construction of new infrastructure. Decades later, a great many literary works and films covered the eras events.\\nThe descriptor Informbiro period arose from the Communist Information Bureau, an organisation initiated by Stalin that had aimed to reduce divergence among communist governments.\\n\\n"

Kjellbergs popularity on YouTube and extensive media coverage have made him one of the most noted online personalities and content creators. He has been portrayed in the media as a figurehead for YouTube and as being almost synonymous with YouTube gaming.\\nBorn and raised in Gothenburg, Kjellberg registered his YouTube channel PewDiePie in 2010, primarily posting Lets Play videos of horror and action video games. His channel gained a substantial following and was one of the fastest growing channels in 2012 and 2013, before becoming the most-subscribed on YouTube on 15 August 2013. From 29 December 2014 to 14 February 2017, Kjellbergs channel was also the most-viewed on the platform. During this period, his content shifted focus from Lets Plays and diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos.

In 2019, following a public competition with Indian record label T-Series, Kjellberg was overtaken as the most-subscribed YouTube channel. Shortly after, Minecraft-related videos emerged as popular entries in his video catalog. Subsequently, Kjellberg became more reserved online, uploading less consistently and taking frequent breaks from Internet use. He also semi-retired from YouTube, choosing to upload for fun, rather than as a career. Meanwhile, in his personal life, he moved to Japan with his wife, Italian youtuber Marzia.\\nWith over 111 million subscribers and 28.7 billion views, his channel still ranks as one of the most-subscribed and viewed on the platform."

He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta and first appeared, along with the rest of his family, in The Tracey Ullman Show short Good Night on April 19, 1987. Homer was created and designed by cartoonist Matt Groening while he was waiting in the lobby of producer James L. Brookss office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic strip Life in Hell but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the character after his father, Homer Groening. After appearing for three seasons on The Tracey Ullman Show, the Simpson family got their own series on Fox, which debuted December 17, 1989. The show was later acquired by Disney in 2019.\\nAs the nominal foreman of the paternally eponymous family, Homer and his wife Marge have three children: Bart, Lisa and Maggie. As the familys provider, he works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant as safety inspector. Homer embodies many American working class stereotypes: he is obese, immature, outspoken, aggressive, balding, lazy, ignorant, unprofessional, and addicted to beer, junk food and watching television. However, he is fundamentally a good man and is staunchly protective of his family, especially when they need him the most. Despite the suburban blue-collar routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences, including going to space, climbing the tallest mountain in Springfield by himself, fighting former President George H. W. Bush, and winning a Grammy Award as a member of a barbershop quartet.\\nIn the shorts and earlier episodes, Castellaneta voiced Homer with a loose impression of Walter Matthau; however, during the second and third seasons of the half-hour show, Homers voice evolved to become more robust, to allow the expression of a fuller range of emotions. He has appeared in other media relating to The Simpsonsincluding video games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials, and comic booksand inspired an entire line of merchandise. His signature catchphrase, the annoyed grunt Doh!, has been included in The New Oxford Dictionary of English since 1998 and the Oxford English Dictionary since 2001.\\nHomer is one of the most influential characters in the history of television, and is widely considered to be an American cultural icon. The British newspaper The Sunday Times described him as The greatest comic creation of modern time. He was named the greatest character of the last 20 years in 2010 by Entertainment Weekly, was ranked the second-greatest cartoon character by TV Guide, behind Bugs Bunny, and was voted the greatest television character of all time by Channel 4 viewers. For voicing Homer, Castellaneta has won four Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance and a special-achievement Annie Award. In 2000, Homer and his family were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame."

Its origin is traced to the Eagles upsetting the Green Bay Packers in the 1960 NFL Championship Game. This game ended up being the lone playoff defeat in Lombardis coaching career as his Packers established a dynasty that won five NFL championships in the next seven seasons, including the first two Super Bowls.\\nMeanwhile, the Eagles had not won another league championship since, including having never won the Super Bowl since the game started being played annually in 1966. They appeared in Super Bowl XV in the 1980 season and Super Bowl XXXIX in the 2004 season, but lost both times. In 1970, the Super Bowl trophy was officially named the Vince Lombardi trophy when the league decided to honor Lombardi by naming the trophy after him following his death in 1970. This renaming of the Super Bowl trophy combined with the Eagles inability to win the championship game has led some Eagles fans to believe that the franchise is cursed by Vince Lombardi; that beating Lombardi meant never winning the trophy named after him.The Eagles defeated the New England Patriots by a score of 4133 in Super Bowl LII at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota on February 4, 2018, ending the alleged curse."

In the MCU, he is depicted as one of the most powerful Asgardians, an ancient alien civilization with long ties to Earth, who humans consider to be gods. Thor wields a powerful hammer called Mjolnir, and is initially depicted as the arrogant heir to the throne of Asgard whose brash behaviors causes turmoil among the Nine Realms under Asgards protection. This brings him into conflict with his villainous adopted brother, Loki. Thor commits himself to the protection of Earth, and becomes a founding member of the Avengers. Thor eventually becomes the King of Asgard after Odins death, but the entire realm is destroyed during the battle with his sister Hela. Thor then comes into conflict with Thanos, who slaughters half of the Asgardians and uses the Infinity Stones to erase half of the life in the universe before Thor himself kills Thanos. Thor later joins his fellow Avengers in obtaining the Stones from the past using time travel and they successfully undo Thanos actions. When an alternate version of Thanos enters their timeline, Thor and his allies manage to defeat him. Thor then passes the crown of New Asgard to Valkyrie and joins the Guardians of the Galaxy. Thor later comes into conflict with Gorr the God Butcher and the Olympian god Zeus, while reconnecting with his terminally ill ex-girlfriend, the now Mjolnir-wielding Jane Foster. After Foster succumbs to her cancer to assist in Gorrs defeat, Thor adopts the latters daughter, Love. \\nAs of 2022, Thor is a central figure of the MCU, having appeared in nine films, the most-recent being Thor: Love and Thunder 2022. Although the first two Thor films have been among the less well-received films in the MCU, Thor: Ragnarok, with its substantial reinvention of the character, has been held up as one of the best MCU films and often credited as revitalizing Thor and his storyline, and the reception of his character has become much more favorable.Alternate versions of the character appear in the animated series What If.? 2021, with Hemsworth reprising the role. One version in particular, which depicts an alternate Thor who was raised without Loki and is recruited into the Guardians of the Multiverse by the Watcher in the battle against an alternate version of Ultron."

Abbys storylines focused on business dealings, affairs and family troubles. Introduced as the sister of Sid Fairgate, she was initially portrayed as a friendly, warm-hearted woman with great love for her children. In due time, she evolved into the series main antagonist, constantly causing mayhem in others lives. According to series creator David Jacobs, the producers always intended Abby to be a J.R. Ewing-esque character. Jacobs said, When we were casting the role of Abby, we were looking for a homey type, someone whom the other women characters would trust. It was our intention to have this nice person gain the trust of the other women and then cause trouble for them. We didnt want the other characters and the audience to know that there was a scheming person under this nice facade. We wanted her to come on as a good person and then evolve into a vixen.The character became known for her manipulative behavior and was often labeled a soap vixen.

            "Themes in Avatar, The 2009 American science fiction film Avatar has provoked vigorous discussion of a wide variety of cultural, social, political, and religious themes identified by critics and commentators, and the films writer and director James Cameron has responded that he hoped to create an emotional reaction and to provoke public conversation about these topics. The broad range of Avatars intentional or perceived themes has prompted some reviewers to call it an all-purpose allegory and the seasons ideological Rorschach blot. One reporter even suggested that the politically charged punditry has been misplaced: reviewers should have seized on the opportunity to take a break from their usual fodder of public policy and foreign relations rather than making an ideological battlefield of this popcorn epic.Discussion has centered on such themes as the conflict between modern human and nature, and the films treatment of imperialism, racism, militarism and patriotism, corporate greed, property rights, spirituality and religion. Commentators have debated whether the films treatment of the human aggression against the native Navi is a message of support for indigenous peoples today, or is, instead, a tired retelling of the racist myth of the noble savage. Right-wing critics accused Cameron of pushing an anti-American message in the films depiction of a private military contractor that used ex-Marines to attack the natives, while Cameron and others argued that it is pro-American to question the propriety of the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The visual similarity between the destruction of the World Trade Center and the felling of Home Tree in the film caused some filmgoers to further identify with the Navi and to identify the human military contractors as terrorists. Critics asked whether this comparison was intended to encourage audiences to empathize with the position of Muslims under military occupation today.Much discussion has concerned the films treatment of environmental protection and the parallels to, for example, the destruction of rainforests, mountaintop removal for mining and evictions from homes for development. The title of the film and various visual and story elements provoked discussion of the films use of Hindu iconography, which Cameron confirmed had inspired him. Christians, including the Vatican, worried that the film promotes pantheism over Christian beliefs, while others instead thought that it sympathetically explores biblical concepts. Other critics either praised the films spiritual elements or found them hackneyed."

            "Scott Robinson Neighbours, Scott Robinson is a fictional character from the Australian television soap opera Neighbours. He was created by Reg Watson as one of the serials twelve original characters. Originally played by Darius Perkins, he made his debut during the first episode broadcast on 18 March 1985. Perkins was 20 years old when he received the role of teenager Scott. He felt some anxiety about his audition performance and did not think anything was going to come from it, until the production company contacted him a month later to sign on as Scott. When production moved to Network Ten in 1986, producers wanted a more upfront Scott and the role was recast to Jason Donovan, who joined the cast following his graduation from school. He made his debut on 12 February 1986, and producers hoped Donovans blond hair and blue eyes would increase the characters appeal. Perkins later said that he had been physically and mentally exhausted after filming for nine months, and felt unable to continue in the role of Scott.\\nAt the beginning of Neighbours, Scott is a 16 year old high school student, living at home with his father, grandmother, and three siblings. Scott is shown to be close with his father, whom he respects. He is initially characterised as a normal, happy teenager, with an increasing interest in girls as he becomes an adolescent. His best friend was neighbour Danny Ramsay David Clencie, a role Donovan originally auditioned for. Scotts early storylines include a romance with fellow student Kim Taylor Jenny Young and being accused of robbery. With Donovan in the role, Scott was portrayed as charming, perceptive, neat, and likeable, leading him to become the shows male pin up. Donovans popularity set a new standard for casting directors, which they felt they had to meet every time they introduced a new stud character. Producers soon created a story arc around Scotts relationship with Charlene Mitchell, played by Kylie Minogue. \\nScott and Charlenes romance led to increased ratings for Neighbours and the shows publicist capitalised on Minogue and Donovans popularity with viewers. Scott and Charlene experience a variety of problems during their first 12 months together. When Scott suggests they should move in together, this caused controversy on and off-screen, with some Neighbours viewers expressing their concern about a young unwed couple moving in together. Producers then decided that the couple would marry instead and their wedding was broadcast on 1 July 1987 to two million Australian viewers. To keep the relationship interesting, writers scripted a kiss between Scott and Jane Harris Annie Jones. On 7 March 1989, it was announced that Donovan had quit Neighbours to pursue a music career, and his exit aired on 18 May 1989. For his portrayal of Scott, Donovan won the Logie Award for Most Popular New Talent 1987 and Most Popular Actor 1988. He was twice nominated for the Gold Logie for Most Popular Personality. In 2022, Donovan agreed to reprise his role, alongside Minogue, as part of the serials final episode."

Peter Deutsch that states:\\n\\nThe problem with visual programming is that you cant have more than 50 visual primitives on the screen at the same time.The term was made up by Fred Lakin, after Deutsch made the following comment at a talk on visual programming by Scott Kim and Warren Robinett: Well, this is all fine and well, but the problem with visual programming languages is that you cant have more than 50 visual primitives on the screen at the same time. How are you going to write an operating system?The primitives in a visual language are the separate graphical elements used to build a program, and having more of them available at the same time allows the programmer to read more information. This limit is sometimes cited as an example of the advantage of textual over visual languages, pointing out the greater information density of text, and posing a difficulty in scaling the language.However, criticisms of the limit include that it is not clear whether a similar limit also exists in textual programming languages; and that the limit could be overcome by applying modularity to visual programming as is commonly done in textual programming."

            "Lords Prayer, The Lords Prayer, also called the Our Father or Pater Noster, is a central Christian prayer which Jesus taught as the way to pray. Two versions of this prayer are recorded in the gospels: a longer form within the Sermon on the Mount in the Gospel of Matthew, and a shorter form in the Gospel of Luke when one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples. Regarding the presence of the two versions, some have suggested that both were original, the Matthean version spoken by Jesus early in his ministry in Galilee, and the Lucan version one year later, very likely in Judea.The first three of the seven petitions in Matthew address God; the other four are related to human needs and concerns. Matthews account alone includes the Your will be done and the Rescue us from the evil one or Deliver us from evil petitions. Both original Greek texts contain the adjective epiousios, which does not appear in any other classical or Koine Greek literature; while controversial, daily has been the most common English-language translation of this word.\\nInitial words on the topic from the Catechism of the Catholic Church teach that it is truly the summary of the whole gospel. The prayer is used by most Christian denominations in their worship; with few exceptions, the liturgical form is the Matthean. Protestants usually conclude the prayer with a doxology in some versions, For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory, for ever and ever, Amen, a later addition appearing in some manuscripts of Matthew. Although theological differences and various modes of worship divide Christians, according to Fuller Seminary professor Clayton Schmit, there is a sense of solidarity in knowing that Christians around the globe are praying together . and these words always unite us."

The videos were made in response to accusations that a friend had raped Leonhardt, and that Leonhardt had a sexual relationship with the lead singer of the electropop band Blood on the Dance Floor, a man named Dahvie Vanity real name Jesus David Torres while they were a minor. This resulted in a campaign of telephone and internet harassment against Leonhardt and their family, chiefly attributed to 4chan users and members of the internet-based group Anonymous. It began a debate about the dangers of anonymity on the Internet, and whether or not the Internet is a safe environment for minors, and all people in general.Leonhardt told The Independent in 2016: I wouldnt even call what happened to me cyberbullying, it was straight up harassment and stalking. It started out as cyberbullying but it quickly evolved. Vanity has repeatedly denied all of the allegations against him. He has also denied knowing Leonhardt or any of the other victims that have accused him of sexual assault, rape, and child molestation and has stated that Leonhardt had a mental illness. The song You Done Goofed from the Blood on the Dance Floor album Epic is about Leonhardt and Vanitys alleged experiences with them.Assigned female at birth, Leonhardt later came out as transgender and non-binary, now going by the name Damien Leonhardt. In 2018, they accused Vanity of child sexual abuse and rape in a post on social media site Tumblr during their alleged relationship, when Leonhardt was 10 years old. One year later, an additional 21 women accused Vanity of sexual assault, child molestation, and rape, with many of them saying the attacks took place while they were under the age of consent."

            "Homestar Runner, Homestar Runner is an American Flash animated comedy web series and website created by Mike and Matt Chapman, known collectively as The Brothers Chaps. The series centers on the adventures of a large and diverse cast of characters, headed by the lovable yet dense athlete Homestar Runner. It uses a blend of surreal humour, self-parody, and references to popular culture, in particular video games, classic television, and popular music.\\nHomestar Runner originated in 1996 as a parody childrens book by Mike Chapman and Craig Zobel. Whilst learning Macromedia Flash, Mike and his brother Matt expanded the concept into a website, which was launched on New Years Day 2000. While the site originally centered on the title character, the Strong Bad Email cartoon skits quickly became the sites most popular and prominent feature, with Strong Bad, initially the series main antagonist, becoming a breakout character. Since 2000, the site has grown to encompass a variety of cartoons and web games featuring Homestar, Strong Bad, and numerous other characters.\\nAt the peak of its popularity, the site was one of the most-visited sites with collections of Flash cartoons on the web, spreading via word of mouth. The site sustains itself through merchandise sales and has never featured advertisements. The Brothers Chaps have turned down offers to make a television series.After a four-year hiatus beginning in 2010, Homestar Runner returned with a new Holiday Toon on April 1, 2014, for April Fools Day. Afterwards, co-creator Matt Chapman announced plans to give the site semi-regular updates starting in fall 2014, due to the positive reception given to the April Fools Day cartoon. Since global support for Flash ended on December 31, 2020, homestarrunner.com has maintained a fully functional website through the Flash emulator Ruffle. More cartoons have since been released on the website on an occasional basis, usually to celebrate holidays."

Bale was filming with actress Bryce Dallas Howard when he berated director of photography, Shane Hurlbut, for walking into his line of sight. An audio recording of the incident appeared on website TMZ on February 2, 2009. The Mae Shi composed and recorded the song later in the same day, and released it the next day. The group stated that the piece was created to honor Bale. The song parodies Bale by sampling his voice from the 2008 diatribe. The chorus incorporates Bales use of the word professional from his flare-up. The lyrics reference several films the actor starred in, including Newsies, Swing Kids, American Psycho, and The Dark Knight.\\nThe song was made available on YouTube and via download on MediaFire the next day. R U Professional received a generally positive reception, and was praised as an effective parody of Bales on-set disturbance. MTV compared its style to new wave groups like Devo. The Los Angeles Times described it as a lively pop music tribute to the actor. USA Today categorized the song as fun dance music and called it creatively motivated. The Toronto Sun wrote positively of its creative lyrics and use of audio from the Bale oration. El Pas classed the piece as an electropop song that contributed to the viral spread of the Bale rant online. Dose placed the song within the genre of an electro jam session. Publications including The A.V. Club and Pitchfork Media were impressed with the groups ability to compose and release the song twenty-four hours after the audio of the incident appeared online. The Irish Independent wrote that they thought the group may have used a melody they already had and adapted it for the song to release it so quickly."

Ignited by a faulty electric transmission line, the fire originated above several communities and an east wind drove the fire downhill through developed areas. After exhibiting extreme fire spread, fireline intensity, and spotting behaviors through the rural community of Concow, an urban firestorm formed in the foothill town of Paradise. Drought was a factor: Paradise, which typically sees five inches of autumn rain by November 12, had only received one-seventh of an inch by that date in 2018. With the arrival of the first winter rainstorm of the season, the fire reached 100 percent containment after seventeen days on November 25.The Camp Fire caused at least 85 civilian fatalities, with one person still missing as of August 2, 2019, and injured 12 civilians and five firefighters.

The game follows Shadow the Hedgehog, a creation of Doctor Eggmans grandfather, Prof. Gerald Robotnik with the aid of Black Doom, as he attempts to learn about his past while suffering from amnesia. Shadow the Hedgehog reintroduces third-person shooter elements from Sonic Adventure 1 and Sonic Adventure 2 but greatly expands on the concept and newly introduces nonlinear gameplay to the Sonic franchise. To defeat enemies, Shadow can use a variety of weapons from each faction and use the newly introduced Chaos powers to aid him in his quest. Out of the twenty-two levels there are eleven that have three possible missions that the player may choose to complete, the other eleven have two missions. The missions completed determine the games plot and subsequently playable levels.\\nThe development team wanted to make a game featuring Shadow to capitalize on the characters popularity and resolve plot mysteries that began with his introduction in Sonic Adventure 2. It was written and directed by Takashi Iizuka, produced by Yuji Naka, and scored by Jun Senoue. Iizuka, who targeted a younger audience with previous Sonic games, strove to attract an older audience with Shadow the Hedgehog; Shadows character also allowed the team to use elements otherwise inappropriate for the series. \\nThe game was revealed at the March 2005 Walk of Game event, and it was released for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox in North America and in Europe in November 2005 and in Japan the following month. It was met with generally negative reviews from critics, who criticized for its controls, mature themes, level design, and addition of guns and other weapons to traditional Sonic gameplay. However, some praised its replay value. Despite this, the game was commercially successful, selling 2.06 million copies by March 2007.\\nIt is the first game in the series to utilize the voice actors from the 4Kids dub of Sonic X. It is also the first Sonic game to receive an E10+ rating from the ESRB, due to its mild use of profanity and fantasy action violence.\\n\\n"

            "2021 Suez Canal obstruction, In March 2021, the Suez Canal was blocked for six days after the grounding of Ever Given, a 20,000 TEU container ship. The 400-metre-long 1,300 ft vessel was buffeted by strong winds on the morning of 23 March, and ended up wedged across the waterway with its bow and stern stuck in the canal banks, blocking all traffic until it could be freed. Egyptian authorities said that technical or human errors may have also been involved. The obstruction occurred south of the section of the canal that had two channels, so there was no way for other ships to bypass Ever Given. The Suez Canal Authority SCA engaged Boskalis through its subsidiary Smit International to manage marine salvage operations. As one of the worlds busiest trade routes, the canal obstruction had a significant negative impact on trade between Europe, Asia and the Middle East.\\nOn 28 March, at least 369 ships were queuing to pass through the canal. This prevented an estimated US$9.6 billion worth of trade. On 29 March, Ever Given was partially re-floated and moved by about 80 percent in the correct direction, although the bow remained stuck until the ship was finally freed by Egyptian, Dutch, and Italian tugs at 15:05 EGY 13:05 UTC and started moving, under tow, towards the Great Bitter Lake, for technical inspection. The canal was checked for damage, and after being found to be sound, the SCA allowed shipping to resume from 19:00 EGY 17:00 UTC on 29 March. The vessel was subsequently impounded by the Egyptian government on 13 April 2021 for refusing to pay compensations demanded by the government, a claim deemed to be unjustified by the ships insurers. After the incident, the Egyptian government announced that they will be widening the narrower parts of the canal.A formal settlement between the owners and insurers of the ship, and the canal authority, was finally reached in July. The ship set sail again on 7 July 2021 after having been legally stuck in the canal since it had been dislodged, stopping for inspections at Port Said before continuing on its journey to the port of Rotterdam.\\n\\n"

Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli was one of thirteen children born to Marianna Mazzola and Giovanni Battista Roncalli in a family of sharecroppers who lived in Sotto il Monte, a village in the province of Bergamo, Lombardy. He was ordained to the priesthood on 10 August 1904 and served in a number of posts, as nuncio in France and a delegate to Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey. In a consistory on 12 January 1953 Pope Pius XII made Roncalli a cardinal as the Cardinal-Priest of Santa Prisca in addition to naming him as the Patriarch of Venice. Roncalli was unexpectedly elected pope on 28 October 1958 at age 76 after 11 ballots. Pope John XXIII surprised those who expected him to be a caretaker pope by calling the historic Second Vatican Council 19621965, the first session opening on 11 October 1962.\\nJohn XXIII made many passionate speeches during his pontificate. His views on equality were summed up in his statement, We were all made in Gods image, and thus, we are all Godly alike. He made a major impact on the Catholic Church, opening it up to dramatic unexpected changes promulgated at the Vatican Council and by his own dealings with other churches and nations. In Italian politics, he prohibited bishops from interfering with local elections, and he helped the Christian Democracy to cooperate with the Italian Socialist Party. In international affairs, his Ostpolitik engaged in dialogue with the communist countries of Eastern Europe. He especially reached out to the Eastern Orthodox churches. His overall goal was to modernize the Church by emphasizing its pastoral role, and its necessary involvement with affairs of state. He dropped the traditional rule of 70 cardinals, increasing the size to 85. He used the opportunity to name the first cardinals from Africa, Japan, and the Philippines. He promoted ecumenical movements in cooperation with other Christian faiths. In doctrinal matters, he was a traditionalist, but he ended the practice of automatically formulating social and political policies on the basis of old theological propositions.He did not live to see the Vatican Council to completion. His cause for canonization was opened on 18 November 1965 by his successor, Pope Paul VI, who declared him a Servant of God. On 5 July 2013, Pope Francis bypassing the traditionally required second miracle declared John XXIII a saint, based on his virtuous, model lifestyle, and because of the good which had come from his opening of the Second Vatican Council. He was canonized alongside Pope John Paul II on 27 April 2014. John XXIII today is affectionately known as the Good Pope Italian: il Papa buono."

            "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a 2004 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the fifth main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2002s Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and the seventh installment overall. It was released in October 2004 for the PlayStation 2, in June 2005 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox, and in November 2010 for Mac OS X. The game is set within an open world environment that players can explore and interact with at their leisure. The story follows former gangster Carl CJ Johnson, who returns home following his mothers murder and is drawn back into his former gang and a life of crime while clashing with corrupt authorities and powerful criminals. Carls journey takes him across the fictional U.S. state of San Andreas, which is heavily based on California and Nevada and encompasses three major cities: Los Santos inspired by Los Angeles, San Fierro San Francisco and Las Venturas Las Vegas.The game features references to many real-life elements of the world, such as its cities, regions, and landmarks, with its plot heavily based on several real-life events in Los Angeles in the early 1990s, including the rivalry between real-life street gangs, the crack epidemic of the 1980s and early 1990s, the LAPD Rampart scandal, and the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Unlike its predecessor, San Andreas introduced gameplay elements that were incorporated in later games, including RPG-style mechanics, customisation options with both clothing and vehicle appearances, a vast array of activities and mini-games, and the inclusion of gambling games.\\nConsidered by many reviewers to be one of the greatest video games ever made, San Andreas received critical acclaim upon release, with praise directed at its music, story and gameplay, and criticism for its graphics and some aspects of its controls. It was the best-selling video game of 2004, and with over 27.5 million copies sold worldwide as of 2011, it is the best-selling PlayStation 2 game and one of the best-selling video games of all time. Like its predecessors, San Andreas is cited as a landmark in video games for its far-reaching influence within the industry. The games violence and sexual content was the source of much public concern and controversy. In particular, a player-made software patch, dubbed the Hot Coffee mod, unlocked a previously hidden sexual scene, resulting in the game being re-rated AO by the North American Entertainment Software Rating Board although its previous M rating was reinstated after the game was edited to remove the content. A remastered version of the game was released for Android and iOS in 2013, for Windows Phone, Fire OS and Xbox 360 in 2014, and for PlayStation 3 in 2015. In June 2018, the game was made available for the Xbox One via backward compatibility. An enhanced version with the subtitle The Definitive Edition was released in 2021, and a virtual reality version for Oculus Quest 2 is in development. The next main entry in the series, Grand Theft Auto IV, was released in April 2008."

After ending up in the hospital and massacring the surgeons attempting to save Octavius by sawing them off, the arms AI begin influencing his mind and convince him to steal funds in order to attempt the experiment again, over the course of which crime spree the Daily Bugle dubs him Doctor Octopus, or Doc Ock for short. Along the way, he comes into conflict with Spider-Man, with Osborn offering to give Octavius the tritium he needs to complete his experiment in exchange for handing Spider-Man over to him. Ultimately, as the experiment begins to destroy New York City, Spider-Man reveals himself as Peter to Octavius after damaging his arms, and inspires him to regain control of them and sacrifice himself to sink the fusion reactor into the East River, where he presumably drowns. \\nThe character returns in Spider-Man: No Way Home, being transported into another universe shortly before his death, due to a magic spell gone wrong causing a rupture in the multiverse, and ends up clashing with that universes Spider-Man and his allies.

After briefly reuniting with his version of Spider-Man, now older, Octavius is returned to his universe. Molina has expressed further interest in reprising the role in the in-development Sonys Spider-Man Universe SSU film based on The Sinister Six.\\nMolinas performance as the character, considered one of the earliest portrayals of Octavius as a tragic villain, has been positively received by critics and audiences, and the character has come to be considered to be one of the most iconic villains in superhero films."

Walt became a high-school chemistry teacher in Albuquerque, and barely \\nmaking ends meet with his family with wife Skyler Anna Gunn and son Walt Jr. RJ Mitte. At the start of the series, the day after his 50th birthday, Walt is diagnosed with Stage III lung cancer. After this discovery, Walt resorts to manufacturing and selling methamphetamine with a former student, Jesse Pinkman Aaron Paul, to ensure his familys financial security after his death. Due to his chemistry training and production route, Walts blue meth is purer than any other on the market, and he is pulled deeper into the illicit drug trade. \\nWalt becomes increasingly ruthless as the series progresses, and later adopts the alias Heisenberg, which becomes recognizable as a kingpin figure in the Southwestern drug trade. Walt struggles with managing his family while hiding his involvement in the drug business from his brother-in-law and DEA agent Hank Schrader Dean Norris. Walt becomes less sympathetic throughout the show, as series creator Vince Gilligan wanted him to turn from Mr. Chips into Scarface. Although AMC officials initially hesitated to cast Cranston due to his previous comedic role on Malcolm in the Middle, Gilligan cast him based on the actors past performance in The X-Files episode Drive, which Gilligan wrote. Cranston contributed greatly to the creation of his character, including Walts backstory, personality, and physical appearance.\\nOne of the most iconic characters in popular culture, Walter White has been listed among the greatest villains and fictional characters ever created. Both the character and Cranstons performance have received critical acclaim, with White frequently being mentioned as one of the greatest and most iconic television characters of all time. Cranston won four Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, three of them being consecutive. He is the first man to win a Critics Choice, Golden Globe, Primetime Emmy, and Screen Actors Guild Award for his performance. Cranston reprised the role of Walt in a flashback for Breaking Bads sequel film El Camino, and again in the sixth and final season of the prequel series Better Call Saul, making him one of the few characters to appear in all three, alongside Jesse Pinkman, Mike Ehrmantraut Jonathan Banks, Ed Galbraith Robert Forster, and Austin Ramey Todd Terry."

            "Lazy Sunday The Lonely Island song, Lazy Sunday sometimes The Chronic of Narnia rap, The Chronicles of Narnia rap or The Narnia rap is a single and short film by American comedy troupe The Lonely Island. It was released on December 17, 2005, when it premiered on episode nine, season 31 of Saturday Night Live as the troupes second Digital Short. Primarily performed by Andy Samberg and fellow cast member Chris Parnell, the song and accompanying music video follow the two comedians as they eat cupcakes from the Magnolia Bakery, buy snacks at a convenience store, and smuggle the food into a Sunday afternoon matinee of The Chronicles of Narnia.\\nThe song was written by Samberg and Parnell, as well as Lonely Island members Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone, in one night. They recorded the following night in the comedy troupes office and shot the music video around Manhattan two days later using a borrowed camera. After being quickly mixed and edited by Schaffer, the short was approved for broadcast on the next evenings telecast of Saturday Night Live by producer Lorne Michaels.\\nAlthough the writers initially worried the studio audience would respond to the short negatively, the short received a positive reception and enjoyed Internet stardom overnight, with multiple bootleg copies surfacing on video-sharing website YouTube, catapulting the awareness of the then-fledgling website. The song and short brought forth positive critical reception, with many hailing it as a revival for the stagnant series. In retrospect, commentators have named Lazy Sunday as one of the best Saturday Night Live moments of the 2000s."

            "The Blip, The Blip also known as the Decimation and the Snap is a major fictional event depicted in the Marvel Cinematic Universe MCU franchise in which half of all living things in the universe, chosen at random, were exterminated by Thanos snapping his fingers while wielding the Infinity Stones in 2018, and then restored in late 2023 by Bruce Banner using Infinity Stones recovered from different time periods. The Blip appears to refer to the entire event, including the elimination and restoration of the victims. The Blip manifested in the form of the mass disintegration of individual beings into dust, while the reversal had the same dust reforming into the previously deceased individuals, who mostly reappeared in the same location with no direct awareness of what occurred.As of 2022, aspects of the Blip have been featured in Phase Three and Four of the MCU across various media, including Avengers: Infinity War the first depiction 2018, Ant-Man and the Wasp post-credits 2018, Captain Marvel post-credits 2019, Avengers: Endgame 2019, Spider-Man: Far From Home 2019, WandaVision 2021, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier 2021, and Hawkeye 2021.\\nThe consequences of the Blip were substantial and far-reaching. Some were portrayed for comic effects, such as blipped school band members reappearing in the middle of a basketball game, and blipped characters now being years younger than their own unblipped previously younger siblings. Others were portrayed for dramatic effect, such as blipped characters returning to general chaos and confusion, finding that loved ones had died in their absence, their homes and life savings were repossessed, and their jobs had been filled by others. Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige viewed the inclusion of the Blip as a major crux in the MCU timeline, similar to how the Battle of New York in the third act of The Avengers would go on to be referenced as a pivotal event in multiple MCU media.The Blip inspired the creation of a real-world event on the website Reddit, in which a randomly-selected half of the members of a highly popular subreddit would be banned, simulating the effects of the Blip. The ban of over 300,000 accounts, which included Avengers: Infinity War co-director Anthony Russo, was the largest in Reddits history. The Blip, as an event within the MCU, has been compared to the COVID-19 pandemic in the real world, as an event that has a sustained effect on people all over the world."

More than 2 million people responded going and 1.5 million interested on the events page, which subsequently attracted widespread media attention and caused the event to become an Internet meme. Roberts later stated his intentions for the event had been purely comedic, and disavowed responsibility for any casualties had there been any actual attempt to raid the military base.\\nOn the day of the event, only about 150 people were reported to have shown up at the two entrances to Area 51, with none succeeding in entering the site. Two music festivals were planned to coincide with the event: Alienstock in Rachel, Nevada, and Storm Area 51 Basecamp in Hiko, Nevada. An estimated 1,500 people attended these festivals, according to state and local law enforcement. Air Force spokeswoman Grace Manock stated government officials were briefed on the event and discouraged people from attempting to enter military property. Nevada law enforcement also warned potential participants against trespassing. The event had an effect on businesses both locally in Nevada and around the United States, which prepared products for visitors and those attending the event."

            "Four Seasons Total Landscaping press conference, On November 7, 2020, four days after the United States presidential election, Rudy Giuliani, former mayor of New York City and an attorney for then-president Donald Trump, hosted a press conference at Four Seasons Total Landscaping, a small business in the Holmesburg neighborhood of Near Northeast Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The event was held at the companys garage door and parking lot to discuss the status of the Trump campaigns legal challenges to the ballot-counting process in the state, where the presidents apparent lead over Joe Biden in the first ballots counted had shifted to a shortfall as mailed-in ballots were counted for Philadelphia, historically a heavily Democratic city.\\nThe site of the press conference, a local landscaping business, was unexpected. Many journalists and others quickly observed a comical aspect to its location, near a sex shop and a crematorium. This site selection led to speculation that the Trump campaign meant to book the upscale Four Seasons Hotel Philadelphia, five city blocks from the Pennsylvania Convention Center, where Philadelphias ballots were being counted. Shortly after Giuliani began talking to the assembled reporters, the Associated Press projected Biden as the winner of the Pennsylvania vote and thus the nationwide election. Several news outlets characterized the event as the symbolic end of Trumps presidency.The event was ridiculed by journalists and users of social media. It garnered further ridicule after it emerged that one of the witnesses who spoke at the event was a convicted sex offender. It resulted in lawyers withdrawing from the legal team that the Trump campaign had assembled to challenge the election results. In response to the press conference, a Four Seasons-themed charity run was created, and the landscaping company capitalized on the newfound attention by selling T-shirts and other merchandise."

Written by Greg Camp and produced by Eric Valentine, the song was released on May 4, 1999, as the first single from Astro Lounge. The song was one of the last tracks to be written for Astro Lounge, after the bands record label Interscope requested more songs that could be released as singles. In writing it, Camp drew musical influence from contemporary music by artists like Sugar Ray and Third Eye Blind, and sought out to create an anthem for outcasts. In contrast to the more ska punk style of Smash Mouths debut album Fush Yu Mang 1997, the song features a more radio-friendly style.\\nThe song received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised its musical progression from Fush Yu Mang as well as its catchy tone. It was nominated for the Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 42nd Grammy Awards. Subsequent reviews from critics have regarded All Star favorably, with some ranking it as one of the best songs of 1999. The song charted around the world, ranking in the top 10 of the charts in Australia, Canada, and on the Billboard Hot 100, while topping the Billboard Adult Top 40 and Mainstream Top 40 charts.\\nThe songs accompanying music video features characters from the superhero film Mystery Men 1999, which itself prominently featured All Star. The song became ubiquitous in popular culture following multiple appearances in films, most notably in the aforementioned Mystery Men and, later, the DreamWorks Animation film Shrek 2001. It received renewed popularity in the 2010s as an internet meme and has ranked as one of the most-streamed rock songs from 2017 to 2021 in the United States."

Eastern Lands of the Scarlet Devil is a 2002 bullet hell scrolling shoot em up video game developed by Team Shanghai Alice. It is the sixth game in the Touhou Project series, and the first Touhou game to be released for Microsoft Windows. The story follows either the miko Reimu Hakurei or the magician Marisa Kirisame, as they fight through the world of Gensokyo to find the cause of a vampiric mist, covering the sky scarlet red in the middle of summer.\\nZUN, the developer of the Touhou Project series, had planned to end the series after the release of Mystic Square in 1998. After graduating, ZUN started work at Taito as a game developer and composed music for games created by Amusement Makers, publishers of the PC-98 Touhou games. Leaving the group in 2001 but remaining at Taito, he formed the one-man doujin circle Team Shanghai Alice, initially applying as a music circle to the 61st Comiket. After a denial, ZUN then instead decided to develop a full game to submit at Comiket 62, reviving the Touhou Project series. The jump from PC-98 to Windows represented a clean slate for both the series and its developer, and so Embodiment of Scarlet Devil essentially serves as a soft reboot of the series.\\nDue to the handmade nature of indie djinshi works, initial sales of the game were low, being sold for one day at a single Comiket booth. Over the next few months, ZUN would start to open mail orders online for the game. Reception of the game was largely positive: the series soon developed a devout cult following. At Comiket 63, four months after release, there was a single derivative circle dedicated to Touhou; this number would grow to 2,372 circles seven years later, breaking the conventions record. The series move to Windows allowed for Embodiment of Scarlet Devil to reach a much wider audience, and it remains not only one of the most popular and acclaimed Touhou games to date, but one of the most popular games of all time in Japan. Physical copies of the game have been self-published and sold for almost 20 years. In 2013, ZUN stated that Embodiment of Scarlet Devil was the best-selling Touhou game."

Most of the cast signed on by August 2018, and principal filming took place between September and October that year in Vancouver and on Vancouver Island.

During a rites liminal stage, participants stand at the threshold between their previous way of structuring their identity, time, or community, and a new way which completing the rite establishes.\\nThe concept of liminality was first developed in the early twentieth century by folklorist Arnold van Gennep and later taken up by Victor Turner. More recently, usage of the term has broadened to describe political and cultural change as well as rites. During liminal periods of all kinds, social hierarchies may be reversed or temporarily dissolved, continuity of tradition may become uncertain, and future outcomes once taken for granted may be thrown into doubt. The dissolution of order during liminality creates a fluid, malleable situation that enables new institutions and customs to become established. The term has also passed into popular usage and has been expanded to include liminoid experiences that are more relevant to post-industrial society."

Upon its release March 6, 2012 for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows, Mass Effect 3 generated controversy. Its ending was poorly received by players who felt that it did not meet their expectations. On June 26, 2012, developers released an Extended Cut as downloadable content DLC intended to clarify the endings and remedy fan concerns. The initial announcement of the development of add-on content to amend the ending as well as the subsequent release of Extended Cut sparked debates over the treatment of video games as art and whether BioWare should have to alter their vision of the work in response to external pressure, regardless of its quality. Both BioWare and EA have been criticized for questionable business practices over the release of Mass Effect 3: From Ashes as paid DLC on the same date as the base games launch and the casting of Jessica Chobot, a video game media personality who was affiliated with video game journalist websites IGN and G4TV at the time, as non-player character Diana Allers. The inclusion of expanded LGBT content with full fledged romance options, the creative decision to utilize a stock photo as the basis of popular companion character TaliZorahs face, and an online poll to determine the redesigned appearance of the female version of player character Commander Shepard for Mass Effect 3 have also provoked controversy."

The meme has also extended to using the songs lyrics, or singing it, in unexpected contexts. Rick Astley has also been Rickrolled on several occasions.The meme grew out of a similar bait-and-switch trick called duck rolling that was popular on the 4chan website in 2006. The video bait-and-switch trick grew popular on 4chan by 2007 April Fools Day and spread to other Internet sites later that year. The meme gained mainstream attention in 2008 through several publicized events, particularly when YouTube used it on its 2008 April Fools Day event.Rick Astley, who had only returned to performing after a 10-year hiatus, was initially hesitant about using his newfound popularity from the meme to further his career but accepted the fame by Rickrolling the 2008 Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade with a surprise performance of the song.

            "Ancient Greek literature, Ancient Greek literature is literature written in the Ancient Greek language from the earliest texts until the time of the Byzantine Empire. The earliest surviving works of ancient Greek literature, dating back to the early Archaic period, are the two epic poems the Iliad and the Odyssey, set in an idealized archaic past today identified as having some relation to the Mycenaean era. These two epics, along with the Homeric Hymns and the two poems of Hesiod, Theogony and Works and Days, constituted the major foundations of the Greek literary tradition that would continue into the Classical, Hellenistic, and Roman periods.\\nThe lyric poets Sappho, Alcaeus, and Pindar were highly influential during the early development of the Greek poetic tradition. Aeschylus is the earliest Greek tragic playwright for whom any plays have survived complete. Sophocles is famous for his tragedies about Oedipus, particularly Oedipus the King and Antigone. Euripides is known for his plays which often pushed the boundaries of the tragic genre. The comedic playwright Aristophanes wrote in the genre of Old Comedy, while the later playwright Menander was an early pioneer of New Comedy. The historians Herodotus of Halicarnassus and Thucydides, who both lived during the fifth century BC, wrote accounts of events that happened shortly before and during their own lifetimes. The philosopher Plato wrote dialogues, usually centered around his teacher Socrates, dealing with various philosophical subjects, whereas his student Aristotle wrote numerous treatises, which later became highly influential.\\nImportant later writers included Apollonius of Rhodes, who wrote The Argonautica, an epic poem about the voyage of the Argonauts; Archimedes, who wrote groundbreaking mathematical treatises; and Plutarch, who wrote mainly biographies and essays. The second-century AD writer Lucian of Samosata was a Greek, who wrote primarily works of satire. Ancient Greek literature has had a profound impact on later Greek literature and also western literature at large. In particular, many ancient Roman authors drew inspiration from their Greek predecessors. Ever since the Renaissance, European authors in general, including Dante Alighieri, William Shakespeare, John Milton, and James Joyce, have all drawn heavily on classical themes and motifs."

The soundtrack incorporates numerous works of classical music, by composers including Richard Strauss, Johann Strauss II, Aram Khachaturian, and Gyrgy Ligeti.\\nThe film received diverse critical responses, ranging from those who saw it as darkly apocalyptic to those who saw it as an optimistic reappraisal of the hopes of humanity. Critics noted its exploration of themes such as human evolution, technology, artificial intelligence, and the possibility of extraterrestrial life. It was nominated for four Academy Awards, winning Kubrick the award for his direction of the visual effects.

            "Late antiquity",
            "Late antiquity, Late antiquity is the time of transition from classical antiquity to the Middle Ages, generally spanning the 3rd8th century in Europe and adjacent areas bordering the Mediterranean Basin. The popularization of this periodization in English has generally been credited to historian Peter Brown, after the publication of his seminal work The World of Late Antiquity 1971. Precise boundaries for the period are a continuing matter of debate, but Brown proposes a period between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Generally, it can be thought of as from the end of the Roman Empires Crisis of the Third Century 235284 to the early Muslim conquests 622750, or as roughly contemporary with the Sasanian Empire 224651. In the West its end was earlier, with the start of the Early Middle Ages typically placed in the 6th century, or earlier on the edges of the Western Roman Empire.\\nThe Roman Empire underwent considerable social, cultural and organizational changes starting with the reign of Diocletian, who began the custom of splitting the Empire into Eastern and Western portions ruled by multiple emperors simultaneously. The Sasanian Empire supplanted the Parthian Empire and began a new phase of the RomanPersian Wars, the RomanSasanian Wars. The divisions between the Greek East and Latin West became more pronounced. The Diocletianic Persecution of Christians in the early 4th century was ended by Galerius and under Constantine the Great, Christianity was made legal in the Empire. The 4th century Christianization of the Roman Empire was extended by the conversions of Tiridates the Great of Armenia, Mirian III of Iberia and Ezana of Axum, who later invaded and ended the Kingdom of Kush. During the late 4th century reign of Theodosius I, Nicene Christianity was proclaimed the state church of the Roman Empire. \\nThe city of Constantinople became the permanent imperial residence in the East by the 5th century and superseded Rome as the largest city in the Late Roman Empire and the Mediterranean Basin. The longest Roman aqueduct system, the 250 km 160 mi-long Aqueduct of Valens was constructed to supply it with water, and the tallest Roman triumphal columns were erected there.\\nMigrations of Germanic, Hunnic, and Slavic tribes disrupted Roman rule from the late 4th century onwards, culminating first in the Sack of Rome by the Visigoths in 410 and subsequent Sack of Rome by the Vandals in 455, part of the eventual collapse of the Empire in the West itself by 476. The Western Empire was replaced by the so-called barbarian kingdoms, with the Arian Christian Ostrogothic Kingdom ruling Rome from Ravenna. The resultant cultural fusion of Greco-Roman, Germanic, and Christian traditions formed the foundations of the subsequent culture of Europe.\\nIn the 6th century, Roman imperial rule continued in the East, and the Byzantine-Sasanian wars continued. The campaigns of Justinian the Great led to the fall of the Ostrogothic and Vandal Kingdoms, and their reincorporation into the Empire, when the city of Rome and much of Italy and North Africa returned to imperial control. Though most of Italy was soon part of the Kingdom of the Lombards, the Roman Exarchate of Ravenna endured, ensuring the so-called Byzantine Papacy. Justinian constructed the Hagia Sophia, a great example of Byzantine architecture, and the first outbreak of the centuries-long first plague pandemic took place. At Ctesiphon, the Sasanians completed the Taq Kasra, the colossal iwan of which is the largest single-span vault of unreinforced brickwork in the world and the triumph of Sasanian architecture.\\nThe middle of the 6th century was characterized by extreme climate events the volcanic winter of 535-536 and the Late Antique Little Ice Age and a disastrous pandemic the Plague of Justinian in 541. The effects of these events in the social and political life are still under discussion.\\nIn the 7th century the disastrous ByzantineSasanian War of 602628 and the campaigns of Khosrow II and Heraclius facilitated the emergence of Islam in the Arabian Peninsula during the lifetime of Muhammad. Subsequent Muslim conquest of the Levant and Persia overthrew the Sasanian Empire and permanently wrested two thirds of the Eastern Roman Empires territory from Roman control, forming the Rashidun Caliphate.\\nThe Byzantine Empire under the Heraclian dynasty began the middle Byzantine period, and together with the establishment of the later 7th century Umayyad Caliphate, generally marks the end of late antiquity."

            "1 in 60 rule, In air navigation, the 1 in 60 rule is a rule of thumb which states that if a pilot has travelled sixty miles then an error in track of one mile is approximately a 1 error in heading, and proportionately more for larger errors. The rule is used by pilots with many other tasks to perform, often in a basic aircraft without the aid of an autopilot, who need a simple process that can be performed in their heads. This rule is also used by air traffic controllers to quickly determine how much to turn an aircraft for separation purposes.\\nThe rule is based on the small-angle approximation which states that, for small angles, sin  , where is in radians, along with the fact that one radian which is about 57.3 is close to 60. In reality a 1 mile in 60 error is 0.96, and the rule becomes increasingly inaccurate for larger errors. But since even a skilled pilot cannot manually fly with better than about 2 accuracy, and winds are constantly varying, the rule remains useful for most realistic situations.\\nThis rule of thumb is incredibly powerful in the aviation environment. It states that for each degree off or displacement over a distance of 60 nautical miles NM, it will result in 1 NM off course. It can be applied in various areas of interest when flying, and is easily remembered. This proves to be valuable in many different scenarios, en route navigation, approach, and even on vertical profiles.\\nThe math behind this shows that this method is not entirely accurate, with roughly a 5% error, but the rules objective is to get workable numbers in a dynamic environment, and it fits this purpose quite well. Here is the breakdown:\\nA circle of 60 NM radius has a circumference of:\\n\\n2 x 60 x = 376.99 NM376.99 divided by 360 produces:\\n\\n376.99/360 = 1.047 NM off by 4.7%This rule is therefore very good approximation.\\nAs a coincidence, 1 NM is about 6,000 feet 6,076.1 feet so we can use the 60:1 rule for this too. For a 1 degree shift at 1 NM, there are about 100 feet of offset.\\nThis becomes very useful for estimating or correcting vertical speed settings and flight path angles FPA during climb, descent, or approaches.\\nIf a gradient in % is required, the numbers work out with the same rule:\\n\\n1% over 1 NM 60It is also useful to find out the lateral deviation from a given VOR course or radial: Each dot on a VOR indicator represents 2 of deviation, or 200 per dot per DME.\\nThere are other applications to this rule. One such application is time drift.\\nAn hour is equal to 60 minutes, and a minute is equal to 60 seconds, so some other relationships between angle and time can be observed."

It derives from a similar phrase in the Hebrew Bible which positively depicts martyrdom in both the Jewish and Christian religious traditions. Opposition to the phrase became associated with Jewish nationalism due to its use in Josippon and by Jewish self-defense groups after the 1903 Kishinev pogrom. During the Holocaust, Abba Kovner and other Jewish resistance leaders used the phrase to exhort Jews to fight back. In postwar Israel, some demonized Holocaust survivors as having gone like sheep to the slaughter while armed resistance was glorified. The phrase was taken to mean that Jews had not tried to save their own lives, and consequently were partly responsible for their own suffering and death. This myth, which has become less prominent over time, is frequently criticized by historians, theologians, and survivors as a form of victim blaming."

            "Night Doctors, Night Doctors, also known as Night Riders, Night Witches, Ku Klux Doctors, and Student Doctors, are bogeymen of African American folklore with some factual basis. Body snatching from graves and enforced medical experimentation led to the development of African American folklore stories that told of doctors referred to as Night Doctors who would abduct, kill, and dissect bodies. These Night Doctors purpose was to further prevent slaves, freedmen, and black workers from leaving for the Northern United States. The term night doctors is often broadly used, referring to those who steal, buy, or practice on African American corpses to further their medical knowledge. At this time, the cadaver shortage among medical schools in the south led to people digging up their graves in the night to steal bodies, and slave owners selling their deceased to make some extra money. Grave robbing often happened in poor communities where they had no means to have or fund any deterrence of grave robbing or protection of their cemeteries. Night doctors preying on these marginalized communities were often overlooked by wealthier, more powerful people in the communities, and inevitably led to the fleeing of African Americans in the early to mid 20th century, now known as The Great Migration.The African American communitys distrust of the medical occupation and doctors predates the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, where doctors unethically withheld treatment from African Americans with the disease to use them as an experimental basis for untreated syphilis. When night doctors started emerging, the bodies of southern blacks were a valuable resource for dissection and autopsy studies in medical colleges. The horrors night doctors caused continued even after the Civil war as they kept stealing African American bodies for dissection. Unethical practices against African Americans led to fear and distrust in the medical community."

It was independently released on YouTube from June 16, 2006 to August 1, 2008, and was also briefly released on Revver and Myspace. The series revolves around the initially mundane life of homeschooled 16-year-old Bree Avery Jessica Lee Rose, who uses the username Lonelygirl15 online. She goes on the run with her friend Daniel Yousef Abu-Taleb after her parents mysterious religion is revealed to be The Order, a blood-harvesting operation that wants her trait positive blood. The series is presented through video blogs, or vlogs, originally recorded solely from Brees bedroom.\\nAfter discovering YouTube in 2005, Beckett, then a doctor, came up with the idea for a series of staged video blogs presented as though they were real, and set out to create Lonelygirl15 with Flinders, a filmmaker. The two wrote a script and came up with the character of Bree together. Greg and Amanda Goodfried, both lawyers, were brought on to handle the business aspect of the project and to manage Brees online affairs, respectively. Brees first few vlogs were posted to the Lonelygirl15 YouTube channel in June 2006, and they quickly gained popularity on the website, eventually making Lonelygirl15 the most-subscribed YouTube channel. \\nAs the series gained popularity, viewers began to question its authenticity, and users of the Lonelygirl15.com forum soon found proof that it was fake after messaging Bree on Myspace and tracing her IP address to the offices of Creative Artists Agency, where Amanda Goodfried worked. A story published by the Los Angeles Times revealing this information, as well as a post on journalist Tom Foremskis blog Silicon Valley Watcher revealing Roses identity, led to the project being outed as a hoax in September 2006. Viewership for the series continued to grow after the reveal, and it experienced its highest viewership in 2007.\\nBree has frequently been called YouTubes first viral star, and Lonelygirl15 became known for calling into question the authenticity of web content and for pioneering vlogging. Over the course of its release, Lonelygirl15 won a Webby Award and a VH1 Big in 06 Award, and was nominated for a YouTube Award. EQAL, a production company founded by Beckett and Flinders, produced several spinoffs of the series, including KateModern and LG15: The Resistance."

It recounts the adventures of an eponymous Russian soldier, who passes between the world of the living, Heaven and Hell, on a quest for immortality. In the beginning of the story, God rewards Ivans charitable nature with a pouch with which he can trap all things in existence, and used by the soldier to subdue Satan and the multitude of devils, and eventually serve his purpose of cheating Death. The text also includes a portrayal of Saint Peter as the gatekeeper of Heaven, a reference to the miraculous powers of Saint Nicholas, as well as humorous references to the lifestyle of local aristocrats, or boyars. The protagonist himself is shown to be devoted and intelligent, but is primarily motivated by partying and drinking, activities which he engages in for eternity.\\nOne of Creangs celebrated contributions to Romanian literature, Ivan Turbinc has become a familiar point of reference for the reading public and critics in both Romania and Moldova. It has notably inspired a short story by Moldovan author Vlad Iovi and the 1967 Moldovan film Se caut un paznic."

The measure of salt greatly depends on the size of the tunnel or crack connecting it to the sea.Due to the specific level of salt in the water, and the fact that the lakes are so secluded, marine lakes house a large amount of unique species, often found nowhere else on the planet. Destruction of one such lake hence means that many species can become extinct with it."

            "Human history, Human history, also called world history, is the narrative of humanitys past. It is understood and studied through anthropology, archaeology, genetics, and linguistics. Since the invention of writing, human history has been studied through primary and secondary source documents.\\nHumanitys written history was preceded by its prehistory, beginning with the Paleolithic Old Stone Age era. This was followed by the Neolithic New Stone Age era, which saw the Agricultural Revolution begin in the Middle East around 10,000 BCE. During this period, humans began the systematic husbandry of plants and animals. As agriculture advanced, most humans transitioned from a nomadic to a settled lifestyle as farmers in permanent settlements. The relative security and increased productivity provided by farming allowed communities to expand into increasingly larger units, fostered by advances in transportation.\\nThe earliest complex societies appeared in fertile river valleys. As farming developed, grain agriculture became more sophisticated and prompted a division of labour to store food between growing seasons. Labor divisions led to the rise of a leisured upper class and the development of cities, which provided the foundation for civilization. The growing complexity of human societies necessitated systems of accounting and writing. Hinduism developed in the late Bronze Age on the Indian subcontinent, while the Axial Age witnessed the introduction of religions such as Buddhism, Jainism, Taoism, and Zoroastrianism.\\nWith civilizations flourishing, ancient history saw the rise and fall of empires. Post-classical history the Middle Ages from about 500 to 1500 CE witnessed the rise of Christianity, the Islamic Golden Age, and the Renaissance from around 1300 CE. The 15th century introduction of movable type printing in Europe revolutionized communication and facilitated widespread dissemination of information, hastening the end of the Middle Ages and ushering in the Scientific Revolution. The early modern period lasted from about 1500 to 1800 CE. Events during this period included the Age of Discovery and the Age of Enlightenment. By the 18th century, the accumulation of knowledge and technology had reached a critical mass that brought about the Industrial Revolution and began the late modern period, which started around 1800 CE and continues.\\nThe above scheme of historical periodization dividing history into antiquity, post-classical, early modern, and late modern periods was developed for, and applies best to, the history of the Old World, particularly Europe and the Mediterranean. Outside this region, including Chinese and Indian civilizations, historical timelines unfolded differently up to the 18th century. By that century, due to extensive international trade and colonization, the histories of most civilizations had become substantially intertwined. Over the last quarter-millennium, the rates of growth of population, agriculture, industry, commerce, scientific knowledge, technology, communications, destructive weapons, and environmental degradation have greatly accelerated."

            "Dunbars number, Dunbars number is a suggested cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationshipsrelationships in which an individual knows who each person is and how each person relates to every other person. This number was first proposed in the 1990s by British anthropologist Robin Dunbar, who found a correlation between primate brain size and average social group size. By using the average human brain size and extrapolating from the results of primates, he proposed that humans can comfortably maintain 150 stable relationships. There is some evidence that brain structure predicts the number of friends one has, though causality remains to be seen. Dunbar explained it informally as the number of people you would not feel embarrassed about joining uninvited for a drink if you happened to bump into them in a bar. Dunbar theorised that this limit is a direct function of relative neocortex size, and that this, in turn, limits group size . the limit imposed by neocortical processing capacity is simply on the number of individuals with whom a stable inter-personal relationship can be maintained. On the periphery, the number also includes past colleagues, such as high school friends, with whom a person would want to reacquaint themselves if they met again. Proponents assert that numbers larger than this generally require more restrictive rules, laws, and enforced norms to maintain a stable, cohesive group. It has been proposed to lie between 100 and 250, with a commonly used value of 150.\\n\\n"

These include the theory that high-level government officials had advance knowledge of the attacks. Government investigations and independent reviews have rejected these theories. Proponents of these theories assert that there are inconsistencies in the commonly accepted version, or that there exists evidence that was ignored, concealed, or overlooked.The most prominent conspiracy theory is that the collapse of the Twin Towers and 7 World Trade Center were the result of controlled demolitions rather than structural failure due to impact and fire. Another prominent belief is that the Pentagon was hit by a missile launched by elements from inside the U.S. government, or that hijacked planes were remotely controlled, or that a commercial airliner was allowed to do so via an effective stand-down of the American military. Possible motives claimed by conspiracy theorists for such actions include justifying the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq even though the U.S. government concluded Iraq was not involved in the attacks to advance their geostrategic interests, such as plans to construct a natural gas pipeline through Afghanistan. Other conspiracy theories revolve around authorities having advance knowledge of the attacks and deliberately ignoring or assisting the attackers.The National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST and the technology magazine Popular Mechanics have investigated and rejected the claims made by 9/11 conspiracy theorists. The 9/11 Commission and most of the civil engineering community accept that the impacts of jet aircraft at high speeds in combination with subsequent fires, not controlled demolition, led to the collapse of the Twin Towers, but some conspiracy theory groups, including Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth, disagree with the arguments made by NIST and Popular Mechanics.\\n\\n"

It was popularised by pioneering and successful retailers such as Harry Gordon Selfridge, John Wanamaker and Marshall Field. They advocated that customer complaints should be treated seriously so that customers do not feel cheated or deceived. This attitude was novel and influential when misrepresentation was rife and caveat emptor let the buyer beware was a common legal maxim. Variations include le client na jamais tort the customer is never wrong which was the slogan of hotelier Csar Ritz who said, If a diner complains about a dish or the wine, immediately remove it and replace it, no questions asked. A variation frequently used in Germany is der Kunde ist Knig the customer is king, while in Japan the motto okyakusama wa kamisama desu meaning the customer is a god, is common.\\nIt was pointed out as early as 1914 that this view ignores that customers can be dishonest, have unrealistic expectations, and/or try to misuse a product in ways that void the guarantee. If we adopt the policy of admitting whatever claims the customer makes to be proper, and if we always settle them at face value, we shall be subjected to inevitable losses. The work concluded If the customer is made perfectly to understand what it means for him to be right, what right on his part is, then he can be depended on to be right if he is honest, and if he is dishonest, a little effort should result in catching him at it. An article a year later by the same author addressed the caveat emptor aspect while raising many of the same points as the earlier piece."

            "Mystery Science Theater 3000, Mystery Science Theater 3000 abbreviated as MST3K is an American science fiction comedy film review television series created by Joel Hodgson. The show premiered on KTMA-TV now WUCW in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on November 24, 1988. It then moved to nationwide broadcast, first on The Comedy Channel/Comedy Central for seven seasons until its cancellation in 1996. Thereafter, it was picked up by The Sci-Fi Channel and aired for three more seasons until another cancellation in August 1999. A 60-episode syndication package titled The Mystery Science Theater Hour was produced in 1993 and broadcast on Comedy Central and syndicated to TV stations in 1995. In 2015, Hodgson led a crowdfunded revival of the series with 14 episodes in its eleventh season, first released on Netflix on April 14, 2017, with another six-episode season following on November 22, 2018. A second successful crowdfunding effort in 2021 will bring at least 13 additional episodes to be shown through the Gizmoplex, an online platform that Hodgson will develop for future MST3K works that launched in March 2022. As of 2022, 218 episodes and a feature film have been produced as well as three live tours.\\nThe show initially starred Hodgson as Joel Robinson, a janitor trapped by two mad scientists The Mads on the Earth-orbiting Satellite of Love, and forced to watch a series of B movies to monitor his reaction to them. To keep his sanity, Joel crafts sentient robot companions, including Tom Servo, Crow T. Robot, and Gypsy, to keep him company and help him humorously comment on each movie as it plays, a process known as riffing. Each two-hour episode would feature a single movie often edited for time constraints, sometimes preceded by various old shorts and educational films, with Joel, Tom, and Crow watching in silhouette from a row of theater seats at the bottom of the screen. These theater segments were framed with interstitial sketches called host segments. The shows cast changed over its duration; most notably, the character of Joel was replaced by Mike Nelson played by Michael J. Nelson halfway through the shows fifth season. Other cast members, most of whom were also writers for the show, include Trace Beaulieu, Josh Weinstein, Jim Mallon, Kevin Murphy, Frank Conniff, Mary Jo Pehl, Bill Corbett, Paul Chaplin, and Bridget Jones Nelson. The 2017 revival features a primarily new cast, including Jonah Ray who plays the new human test subject Jonah Heston, along with Felicia Day and Patton Oswalt as The Mads and Baron Vaughn, Hampton Yount, and Rebecca Hanson voicing Tom Servo, Crow T. Robot, and Gypsy, respectively. Season 13 brings back this cast while integrating Emily Connor, played by Emily Marsh, and others from the live tours in this era.\\nMST3Ks original run did not garner high viewership numbers. However, the shows popularity spread through online word-of-mouth by its fans known as MSTies or Mysties who would remind others to Keep circulating the tapes, frequent repeats, syndication, and home media offerings produced by Rhino Entertainment. Currently, this popularity continues through Shout! Factory, who along with Hodgson, now own the rights to the show and supported the revived series. MST3K was listed as one of Time magazines 100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME in 2007, and TV Guide has noted MST3K as one of the top cult television shows. The show won a Peabody Award in 1993, was also nominated for two Emmy Awards in 1994 and 1995, and for the CableACE Award from 1992 to 1997. The show was considered highly influential, contributing towards the practice of social television, and former cast members launched similar projects based on the riffing of films, including The Film Crew, RiffTrax ongoing as of 2022, and Cinematic Titanic. MST3K also brought to light several older movies that had fallen into obscurity or had received little or no public attention when originally released. Many of these films were subsequently identified as among the worst movies ever made, most notably Manos: The Hands of Fate."

In the programme, the Doctor is the alias assumed by a millennia-old humanoid alien, a Time Lord who travels through space and time in the TARDIS, frequently with companions.

The Doctor has been well-received by the public, with an enduring popularity leading The Daily Telegraph to dub the character Britains favourite alien, while abroad the character has come to be seen as a British cultural icon. The Doctor has also been featured in films and a vast range of spin-off novels, audio dramas and comic strips.\\nReturning for the 60th anniversary, David Tennant is now portraying the Fourteenth Doctor, having previously played the Tenth Doctor from 2005-2010, succeeding Jodie Whitaker at the end of The Power of the Doctor.

            "Migration Period, The Migration Period was a period in European history marked by large-scale migrations that saw the fall of the Western Roman Empire and subsequent settlement of its former territories by various tribes, and the establishment of the post-Roman kingdoms. The term refers to the important role played by the migration, invasion, and settlement of various tribes, notably the Franks, Goths, Alemanni, Alans, Huns, early Slavs, Pannonian Avars, Magyars, and Bulgars within or into the former Western Empire and Eastern Europe. The period is traditionally taken to have begun in AD 375 possibly as early as 300 and ended in 568. Various factors contributed to this phenomenon of migration and invasion, and their role and significance are still widely discussed.\\nHistorians differ as to the dates for the beginning and ending of the Migration Period. The beginning of the period is widely regarded as the invasion of Europe by the Huns from Asia in about 375 and the ending with the conquest of Italy by the Lombards in 568, but a more loosely set period is from as early as 300 to as late as 800. For example, in the 4th century a very large group of Goths was settled as foederati within the Roman Balkans, and the Franks were settled south of the Rhine in Roman Gaul. In 406 a particularly large and unexpected crossing of the Rhine was made by a group of Vandals, Alans and Suebi. As central power broke down in the Western Roman Empire, the military became more important but was dominated by men of barbarian origin.\\nThere are contradictory opinions as to whether the fall of the Western Roman Empire was a result of an increase in migrations, or both the breakdown of central power and the increased importance of non-Romans resulted in internal Roman factors. Migrations, and the use of non-Romans in the military, were known in the periods before and after, and the Eastern Roman Empire adapted and continued to exist until the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453. The fall of the Western Roman Empire, although it involved the establishment of competing barbarian kingdoms, was to some extent managed by the eastern emperors.\\nThe migrants comprised war bands or tribes of 10,000 to 20,000 people, but in the course of 100 years they numbered not more than 750,000 in total, compared to an average 40 million population of the Roman Empire at that time. Although immigration was common throughout the time of the Roman Empire, the period in question was, in the 19th century, often defined as running from about the 5th to 8th centuries. The first migrations of peoples were made by Germanic tribes such as the Goths including the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths, the Vandals, the Anglo-Saxons, the Lombards, the Suebi, the Frisii, the Jutes, the Burgundians, the Alemanni, the Sciri and the Franks; they were later pushed westward by the Huns, the Avars, the Slavs and the Bulgars. Later invasions, such as the Vikings, the Normans, the Varangians, the Hungarians, the Moors, the Romani, the Turkics, and the Mongols also had significant effects especially in North Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, Anatolia and Central and Eastern Europe."

This legend gained momentum after the 2002 work of a noted expert on shark attacks was characterized as saying that falling coconuts kill 150 people each year worldwide. This statistic has often been contrasted with the number of shark-caused deaths per year, which is around five.Concern about the risk of fatality due to falling coconuts led local officials in Queensland, Australia, to remove coconut trees from beaches in 2002. One newspaper dubbed coconuts the killer fruit. Historical reports of actual death by coconut nonetheless date back to the 1770s.Another way to die by coconut is to have sudden cardiac death as a result of hyperkalemia, after consuming moderate to large quantities of coconut water, due to the high levels of potassium in coconut water."

The documents, some dating back to the 1970s, were created by, and taken from, former Panamanian offshore law firm and corporate service provider Mossack Fonseca.The documents contain personal financial information about wealthy individuals and public officials that had previously been kept private. The publication of these documents made it possible to establish the prosecution of Jan Marsalek, who is still a person of interest to a number of European governments due to his revealed links with Russian intelligence, and international financial fraudsters David and Josh Baazov. While offshore business entities are legal see Offshore Magic Circle, reporters found that some of the Mossack Fonseca shell corporations were used for illegal purposes, including fraud, tax evasion, and evading international sanctions.John Doe, the whistleblower who leaked the documents to German journalist Bastian Obermayer from the newspaper Sddeutsche Zeitung SZ, remains anonymous, even to the journalists who worked on the investigation. My life is in danger, the whistleblower told them. In a May 6, 2016 document, John Doe cited income inequality as the reason for the action and said the documents were leaked simply because I understood enough about their contents to realize the scale of the injustices they described. Doe had never worked for any government or intelligence agency and expressed willingness to help prosecutors if granted immunity from prosecution. After SZ verified that the statement did in fact come from the source for the Panama Papers, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists ICIJ posted the full document on its website.SZ asked the ICIJ for help because of the amount of data involved. Journalists from 107 media organizations in 80 countries analyzed documents detailing the operations of the law firm. After more than a year of analysis, the first news stories were published on April 3, 2016, along with 150 of the documents themselves. The project represents an important milestone in the use of data journalism software tools and mobile collaboration.\\nThe documents were dubbed the Panama Papers because of the country they were leaked from, but the Panamanian government expressed strong objections to the name over concerns that it would tarnish the governments and countrys image worldwide, as did other entities in Panama and elsewhere. Some media outlets covering the story have used the name Mossack Fonseca papers.In October 2020, German authorities issued an international arrest warrant for the two founders of the law firm at the core of the tax evasion scandal exposed by the Panama Papers.

            "Joe Biden The Onion, Joe Biden also known as Diamond Joe or Uncle Joe is a recurring fictionalized characterization of the American politician of the same name in satirical online newspaper The Onion. Between 2009 and 2019, The Onion staff consistently portrayed Biden as an outrageous character who shared almost nothing with his namesake besides the title of vice president of the United States. Instead, the publication portrayed Biden as a blue-collar average Joe, an affable goofy uncle, a muscle car driver, an avid fan of 1980s hair metal, a raucous party animal, a shameless womanizer, a recidivist petty criminal, and a drug-dealing outlaw. The Biden character became one of The Onions most popular features during the Obama presidency, garnering critical acclaim and a large readership.\\nOnion writer-editor Chad Nackers originated the newspapers distinctive version of Biden, which its staff developed over the course of the real Bidens two terms as vice president. Nackers took inspiration from his upbringing in Midwestern Wisconsin and, more loosely, from aspects of Bidens personality and public face. Although The Onion had mentioned Bidens name as early as 2006, he was not treated as the primary subject of an item in the newspaper until Obamas and his first inauguration in January 2009. The first full-length treatment of the Biden character was a May 2009 article titled Shirtless Biden Washes Trans Am in White House Driveway. The character subsequently appeared in more than 50 Onion articles, as well as numerous videos and other media.\\nDespite the extreme differences between the fictional character and the real politician, The Onion was regarded as having a significant, mostly positive influence on Bidens public image. Commentators noted that the character likely reinforced public perceptions of Biden as a political figure with populist working-class appeal and a good-natured, easy-going disposition. The real Biden made several public comments noting his enjoyment of his characterization in The Onion. In 2016, Mitch McConnell referenced the character on the Senate floor in a speech tributing the departing vice president amid the presidential transition of Donald Trump.\\nEarly reception for the character was generally enthusiastic. As the 2020 Democratic primaries and Bidens 2020 presidential campaign got underway, The Onion attracted criticism for the characters detachment from reality and its distraction from the real Biden. Former Onion editor Joe Garden wrote a self-critical op-ed on the subject in May 2019. While Garden still felt the caricature had been funny, he expressed regret that it had failed to provide more meaningful commentary on the politicians record and what Garden found to be substantive shortcomings. After reviving the Diamond Joe version of Biden in its coverage of the primaries for one final article, The Onion retired the character.\\nSince mid-2019, the publications parodies of Biden have drawn more closely from real-world developments.\\n\\n"

Today, however, rykka refers specifically to Japanese popular music from the late 1920s through the early 1960s. Some of the roots of rykka were developed from Western classical music. Rykka ultimately split into two genres: enka and poppusu. Unlike enka, archetypal rykka songs did not use the kobushi method of singing. Rykka used legato. Bin Uehara and Yoshio Tabata are considered to be among the founders of the modern style of kobushi singing.Many composers and singers of rykka went on to earn official distinctions; Ichiro Fujiyama and composers Masao Koga and Ryoichi Hattori received the Peoples Honour Award in later years.\\nAlthough enka branched off from rykka, many singers of the latter genre proclaimed strong disdain for its stylistic descendant. In a 1981 interview, Noriko Awaya said Whenever I hear enka, I have to get away from the music because I feel like vomiting."

            "The Cat in the Hat film, The Cat in the Hat also known as Dr. Seuss The Cat in the Hat is a 2003 American fantasy comedy film directed by Bo Welch in his directorial debut and written by Alec Berg, David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer. Loosely based on Dr. Seusss 1957 book of the same name, it was the second and final live-action feature-length Dr. Seuss adaptation after How the Grinch Stole Christmas 2000. The film stars Mike Myers in the title role with Alec Baldwin, Kelly Preston, Dakota Fanning, Spencer Breslin, Amy Hill and Sean Hayes in supporting roles.\\nProduction on the film began in 1997 with Tim Allen originally cast in the title role. After Allen dropped out due to scheduling conflicts with The Santa Clause 2, the role went to Myers. Filming took place in California and lasted three months from late 2002 to early 2003. As with the previous Dr. Seuss adaptation, many new characters and subplots were added to the story to bring it up to feature-length.\\nThe film was released in theaters on November 21, 2003 in the United States by Universal Pictures and internationally by DreamWorks Pictures, and was a financial failure, only grossing $133.9 million against a budget of $109 million and was panned by critics. Seusss widow, Audrey Geisel, was critical of the film and decided not to allow any further live-action adaptations of her husbands works, resulting in the cancellation of a sequel based on The Cat in the Hat Comes Back. All Dr. Seuss film adaptations have since been produced using computer animation.In March 2012, an animated remake was announced by Universal and Illumination but never came to fruition. In 2018, Warner Bros. Pictures via Warner Animation Group announced an animated reboot was again in development."

            "Cogito, ergo sum, The Latin cogito, ergo sum, usually translated into English as I think, therefore I am, is the first principle of Ren Descartess philosophy. He originally published it in French as je pense, donc je suis in his 1637 Discourse on the Method, so as to reach a wider audience than Latin would have allowed. It later appeared in Latin in his Principles of Philosophy, and a similar phrase also featured prominently in his Meditations on First Philosophy. The dictum is also sometimes referred to as the cogito. As Descartes explained in a margin note, we cannot doubt of our existence while we doubt. In the posthumously published The Search for Truth by Natural Light, he expressed this insight as dubito, ergo sum, vel, quod idem est, cogito, ergo sum I doubt, therefore I am or what is the same I think, therefore I am. Antoine Lonard Thomas, in a 1765 essay in honor of Descartes presented it as dubito, ergo cogito, ergo sum I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I am.Descartess statement became a fundamental element of Western philosophy, as it purported to provide a certain foundation for knowledge in the face of radical doubt. While other knowledge could be a figment of imagination, deception, or mistake, Descartes asserted that the very act of doubting ones own existence servedat minimumas proof of the reality of ones own mind; there must be a thinking entityin this case the selffor there to be a thought.\\nOne critique of the dictum, first suggested by Pierre Gassendi, is that it presupposes that there is an I which must be doing the thinking. According to this line of criticism, the most that Descartes was entitled to say was that thinking is occurring, not that I am thinking."

Released for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Nvidia Shield TV, and Microsoft Windows, it is a spin-off in the Metal Gear series, and is set four years after the events of Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots. In the game, players control Raiden, a cyborg who confronts the private military company Desperado Enforcement, with the gameplay focusing on fighting enemies using a sword and other weapons to perform combos and counterattacks. Through the use of Blade Mode, Raiden can cut cyborgs in slow motion and steal parts stored in their bodies. The series usual stealth elements are also optional to reduce combat.\\nThe game was originally being developed internally by Kojima Productions, who announced the game in 2009 under the title of Metal Gear Solid: Rising. However, the team met with difficulties in developing a game based on swordplay, so executive producer Hideo Kojima postponed its development until a solution could be found. The project resurfaced in late 2011 under its finalized title, with PlatinumGames as the new developer. The game underwent significant changes in its play mechanics and storyline under PlatinumGames involvement, although Kojima Productions retained responsibility for the games overall plot and Raidens design.\\nUpon its worldwide release in February 2013, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance was well received by critics, being praised for its sophisticated cutting system, its use of Metal Gear elements to complement the story despite the games focus on action, its soundtrack, and its boss fights; some criticism was directed at its camera mechanics and the short length of the story mode. The game also enjoyed positive sales, with the PS3 and Steam versions selling an estimated total of more than 1.2 million copies. While those involved in the games production have expressed desire to develop a sequel, such prospects have yet to come to fruition due to the ensuing conflicts between Konami and Kojima Productions."

            "Novelty piano",
            "Novelty piano, Novelty piano is a genre of piano and novelty music that was popular during the 1920s. A successor to ragtime and an outgrowth of the piano roll music of the 1910s, it can be considered a pianistic cousin of jazz, which appeared around the same time. Nola, a 1915 composition by New York pianist Felix Arndt, is generally considered the first novelty piano hit. Many early novelty composers were piano roll artists from the Chicago area, where two of the largest piano roll companies, QRS and Imperial, were based. While often only lightly syncopated or lacking syncopation entirely, novelty piano influenced the evolution of jazz. It is distinct from stride piano, which was developed in New York at about the same time.\\nThe earliest composers of novelty piano were piano roll artists seeking to sell piano rolls. These pieces started out as highly complex dance pieces with characteristic breaks, consecutive fourths, and advanced harmoniesbut in contrast with ragtime and other jazz piano styles, usually relying on the use of triplets and dotted-eighth/sixteen figures, rather than the syncopated eight-note-based patterns of ragtime. Various theories exist to explain this characteristic: Typically white consumers of such music may not yet have been receptive to music of more rhythmic complexity; and/or because the almost exclusively white composers of novelty piano music had not yet absorbed the principles of syncopated music, and/or were not apt to utilize it when composing, as many of them came from classical music backgrounds where the systematic emphasis of weaker beats was uncommon.\\nThe pioneer of the novelty piano style was Charley Straight, whose compositions were issued on piano roll years before Confreys novelty hits. Early Charley Straight novelties include Smore, Playmor, Nifty Nonsense, Rufenreddy, and Wild And Wooly.\\nNovelty piano came most powerfully to the attention of the public in 1921, with the appearance of Zez Confreys Kitten on the Keys. Its popularity quickly led to other Confrey works including Dizzy Fingers and Greenwich Witch, and inspired other artists to issue novelty pieces. The style remained popular through the end of the decade, at which time big bands were on the rise, player pianos were in decline, and the popularity of jazz continued unabated. Novelty piano slowly succumbed to, or was absorbed into, the new orchestral styles as the piano moved away from center stage and took on more of a supporting role.\\nNovelty piano was also generally marketed differently from the earlier ragtime form. Whilst ragtime was generally sold in the form of sheet music, it was important to keep it simple enough to be played by competent amateurs. By the mid-teens, though, two new technologies had appeared which allowed the general public to hear music as performed by skilled musicians: the piano roll and the phonograph record. Novelty piano was developed as a vehicle to showcase the talents of these professionals, and was thus more often sold in the form of recordings and piano rolls than as sheet music. In contrast with most prior popular piano styles, it was shorn of hackneyed Victorian-era stylings, infused with chromatic flourishes, and influenced by the modernistic sounds of the Art Deco 1920s. Novelty pianists tended to be highly classically trained, and the music reflected their fondness for complex chordal ideas.\\nProminent artists in the novelty piano genre include Zez Confrey, Charley Straight, Roy Bargy, Pauline Alpert, Fred Elizalde, Rube Bloom, Clement Doucet, Max Kortlander, and Billy Mayerl."

Kilkenny cat is also used more generally for a fierce fighter or quarrelsome person. These senses are now rather dated. In the later twentieth century the motif was reclaimed by Kilkenny people as a positive symbol of tenacity and fighting spirit, and the Cats is the county nickname for the Kilkenny hurling team. The original story is attested from 1807 as a simple joke or Irish bull; some early versions are set elsewhere than Kilkenny.

According to the approximate conventional dating, this period begins in 2025 BCE and ended in 1763 BCE. It constitutes the first part of the Old Babylonian period 2025-1595 BCE, the second part being the period of domination of the first dynasty of Babylon, which ends with the Sack of Babylon in 1595 BCE and the rise of the Kassites.The Third Dynasty of Ur immediately preceded the Isin-Larsa period, and its fall was due to the combined attacks of the Amorites from the west, and the Elamites from the east. As its name suggests, the Isin-Larsa period saw successively the emergence of two great powers in Lower Mesopotamia: the kingdom of Isin, which attempts to seek the succession of the kingdom of Ur after its fall and established the Dynasty of Isin, and the kingdom of Larsa, whose fall marks the end of the period. In reality, neither of these two kingdoms exercised an undeniable hegemony in Lower Mesopotamia, and they had to coexist with other less powerful kingdoms such as Uruk, Babylon, and Mankisum, while further north their influence was non-existent and gave way to other powerful political entities Eshnunna, Ekallatum, Mari, Yamkhad. The dynasties of this period have in common a Semitic Amorite origin, even if they quickly acculturated to Mesopotamian traditions."

            "Napoleonic era, The Napoleonic era is a period in the history of France and Europe. It is generally classified as including the fourth and final stage of the French Revolution, the first being the National Assembly, the second being the Legislative Assembly, and the third being the Directory. The Napoleonic era begins roughly with Napoleon Bonapartes coup dtat, overthrowing the Directory 9 November 1799, establishing the French Consulate, and ends during the Hundred Days and his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo 18 June 1815. The Congress of Vienna soon set out to restore Europe to pre-French Revolution days. Napoleon brought political stability to a land torn by revolution and war. He made peace with the Roman Catholic Church and reversed the most radical religious policies of the Convention. In 1804 Napoleon promulgated the Civil Code, a revised body of civil law, which also helped stabilize French society. The Civil Code affirmed the political and legal equality of all adult men and established a merit-based society in which individuals advanced in education and employment because of talent rather than birth or social standing. The Civil Code confirmed many of the moderate revolutionary policies of the National Assembly but retracted measures passed by the more radical Convention. The code restored patriarchal authority in the family, for example, by making women and children subservient to male heads of households.\\nWhilst working to stabilise France, Napoleon also sought to extend his authority throughout Europe. Napoleons armies conquered the Iberian and Italian peninsulas, occupied lands, and he forced Austria, Prussia, and Russia to ally with him and respect French hegemony in Europe. The United Kingdom refused to recognise French hegemony and continued the war throughout.\\nThe First French Empire began to unravel in 1812, when he decided to invade Russia. Napoleon underestimated the difficulties his army would have to face whilst occupying Russia. Convinced that the Tsar was conspiring with his British enemies, Napoleon led an army of 600,000 soldiers to Moscow. He defeated the Russian army at Borodino before capturing Moscow, but the Tsar withdrew and Moscow was set ablaze, leaving Napoleons vast army without adequate shelter or supplies. Napoleon ordered a retreat, but the bitter Russian winter and repeated Russian attacks whittled down his army, and only a battered remnant of 30,000 soldiers managed to limp back to French territory. The allies then continued a united effort against Napoleon until they had seized Paris forcing his abdication in 1814. His return to power the next year was resisted by all the allies and his army was defeated by a Prussian and Anglo-Allied force at Waterloo."

Metafiction is self-conscious about language, literary form, and story-telling, and works of metafiction directly or indirectly draw attention to their status as artifacts. Metafiction is frequently used as a form of parody or a tool to undermine literary conventions and explore the relationship between literature and reality, life, and art.Although metafiction is most commonly associated with postmodern literature that developed in the mid-20th century, its use can be traced back to much earlier works of fiction, such as The Canterbury Tales Geoffrey Chaucer, 1387, Don Quixote Miguel de Cervantes, 1605, The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman Laurence Sterne, 1759, and Vanity Fair William Makepeace Thackeray, 1847. \\nMetafiction became particularly prominent in the 1960s, with works such as Lost in the Funhouse by John Barth, The Babysitter and The Magic Poker by Robert Coover, Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut, The French Lieutenants Woman by John Fowles, The Crying of Lot 49 by Thomas Pynchon, and Willie Masters Lonesome Wife by William H. Gass.\\nSince the 1980s, contemporary Latino literature has an abundance of self-reflexive, metafictional works, including novels and short stories by Junot Daz The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, Sandra Cisneros Caramelo, Salvador Plascencia The People of Paper, Carmen Maria Machado Her Body, Rita Indiana Tentacle, and Valeria Luiselli Lost Children Archive."

            "Watergate scandal, The Watergate scandal was a major political scandal in the United States involving the administration of President Richard Nixon from 1972 to 1974 that led to Nixons resignation. The scandal stemmed from the Nixon administrations continual attempts to cover up its involvement in the June 17, 1972, break-in of the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Washington, D.C., Watergate Office Building.\\nAfter the five perpetrators were arrested, the press and the Justice Department connected the cash found on them at the time to the Committee for the Re-Election of the President. Further investigations, along with revelations during subsequent trials of the burglars, led the House of Representatives to grant the U.S. House Judiciary Committee additional investigative authorityto probe into certain matters within its jurisdiction, and led the Senate to create the U.S. Senate Watergate Committee, which held hearings. Witnesses testified that Nixon had approved plans to cover up his administrations involvement in the break-in, and that there was a voice-activated taping system in the Oval Office. Throughout the investigation, Nixons administration resisted its probes, and this led to a constitutional crisis. The Senate Watergate hearings were broadcast gavel-to-gavel nationwide by PBS and aroused public interest.Several major revelations and egregious presidential actions obstructing the investigation later in 1973 prompted the House to commence an impeachment process against Nixon. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Nixon had to release the Oval Office tapes to government investigators. The Nixon White House tapes revealed that he had conspired to cover up activities that took place after the break-in and had later tried to use federal officials to deflect attention from the investigation. The House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment against Nixon for obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and contempt of Congress. With his complicity in the cover-up made public, and his political support completely eroded, Nixon resigned from office on August 9, 1974. It is generally believed that, if he had not done so, he would have been impeached by the House and removed from office by a trial in the Senate. He is the only U.S. president to have resigned from office. On September 8, 1974, his successor, Gerald Ford, pardoned Nixon.\\nThere were 69 people indicted and 48 peoplemany of them top Nixon administration officialsconvicted. The metonym Watergate came to encompass an array of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken by members of the Nixon administration, including bugging the offices of political opponents and people of whom Nixon or his officials were suspicious; ordering investigations of activist groups and political figures; and using the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Internal Revenue Service as political weapons. The use of the suffix -gate after an identifying term has since become synonymous with public scandal, especially political scandal.\\n\\n"
