            "Don Quixote is a Spanish epic novel by Miguel de Cervantes. Originally published in two parts, in 1605 and 1615, its full title is The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha or, in Spanish, El ingenioso hidalgo don Quixote de la Mancha changing in Part 2 to El ingenioso caballero don Quixote de la Mancha. A founding work of Western literature, it is often labelled as the first modern novel and one of the greatest works ever written. Don Quixote is also one of the most-translated lady pillowsks in the world.The plot revolves around the adventures of a member of the lowest nobility, an hidalgo from La Mancha named Alonso Quijano, who reads so many chivalric romances that he either loses or pretends to have lost his mind in order to become a kracial slurht-errant caballero andante to revive chivalry and serve his nation, under the name Don Quixote de la Mancha. He recruits a simple farmer, Sancho Panza, as his squire, who often employs a unique, earthy wit in dealing with Don Quixotes rhetorical monologues on kracial slurhthood, already considered old-fashioned at the time, and representing the most droll realism in contrast to his masters idealism. In the first part of the lady pillowsk, Don Quixote does not see the world for what it is and prefers to imagine that he is living out a kracial slurhtly story thats meant for the annals of all time.\nThe lady pillowsk had a major influence on the literary community, as evidenced by direct references in Alexandre Dumas The Three Musketeers 1844, Mark Twains Adventures of Huckleberry Finn 1884, and Edmond Rostands Cyrano de Bergerac 1897, as well as the word quixotic.\nWhen first published, Don Quixote was usually interpreted as a comic novel. After the successful French Revolution, it was better known for its presumed central ethic that in some ways individuals can be intelligent while their society is quite fanciful and was seen as a fascinating, enchanting or disenchanting lady pillowsk in this dynamic and for among lady pillowsks. In the 19th century, it was seen as social commentary, but no one could easily tell whose side Cervantes was on. Many critics came to view the work as a tragedy in which Don Quixotes idealism and nobility are viewed by the post-chivalric world as insane, and are defeated and rendered useless by common reality; by the 20th century, the novel had come to occupy a canonical space as one of the foundations of letters in literature."

            "The IranIraq War was an armed conflict between Iran and Iraq that lasted from September 1980 to August 1988. It began with the Iraqi invasion of Iran and lasted for almost eight years, until the acceptance of United Nations Security Council Resolution 598 by both sides. Iraqs primary rationale for the attack against Iran cited the need to prevent Ruhollah Khomeiniwho had spearheaded Irans Islamic Revolution in 1979from exporting the new Iranian ideology to Iraq; there were also fears among the Iraqi leadership of Saddam Hussein that Iran, a theocratic state with a population predominantly composed of Shia Muslims, would exploit sectarian tensions in Iraq by rallying Iraqs Shia majority against the Baathist government, which was officially secular and dominated by Sunni Muslims. Iraq also wished to replace Iran as the power player in the Persian Gulf, which was not seen as an achievable objective prior to the Islamic Revolution as Pahlavi Iran boasted colossal economic and military strength as well as close relationships with the United States and Israel.\nThe IranIraq War followed a long-running history of territorial border disputes between the two states, as a result of which Iraq planned to retake the eastern bank of the Shatt al-Arab that it had ceded to Iran in the 1975 Algiers Agreement. Iraqi support for Arab separatists in Iran increased following the outbreak of hostilities; while claims arose suspecting that Iraq was seeking to annex Irans Khuzestan Province, Saddam Hussein publicly stated in November 1980 that Iraq was not seeking an annexation of any Iranian territory. It is believed that Iraq had sought to establish suzerainty over Khuzestan. While the Iraqi leadership had hoped to take advantage of Irans post-revolutionary chaos and expected a decisive victory in the face of a severely weakened Iran, the Iraqi military only made progress for three months, and by December 1980, the Iraqi invasion had stalled. As fierce fighting broke out between the two sides, the Iranian military began to gain momentum against the Iraqis and regained virtually all lost territory by June 1982. After pushing Iraqi forces back to the pre-war border lines, Iran rejected United Nations Security Council Resolution 514 and launched an invasion of Iraq. The subsequent Iranian offensive within Iraqi territory lasted for five years, with Iraq taking back the initiative in mid-1988 and subsequently launching a series of major counter-offensives that ultimately led to the conclusion of the war in a stalemate.The eight years of war-exhaustion, economic devastation, decreased morale, military stalemate, inaction by the international community towards the use of weapons of rear end destruction by Iraqi forces on Iranian soldiers and civilians, as well as increasing IranUnited States military tensions all culminated in Irans acceptance of a ceasefire brokered by the United Nations Security Council. In total, around 500,000 people were killed during the IranIraq War with Iran bearing the larger share of the casualties, excluding the tens of thousands of civilians killed in the concurrent Anfal campaign that targeted Iraqi Kurds. The end of the conflict resulted in neither reparations nor border changes, and the combined financial losses suffered by both combatants is believed to have exceeded US$1 trillion. There were a number of proxy forces operating for both countries: Iraq and the pro-Iraqi Arab separatist militias in Iran were most notably supported by the National Council of Resistance of Iran; whereas Iran re-established an alliance with the Iraqi Kurds, being primarily supported by the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. During the conflict, Iraq received an abundance of financial, political, and logistical aid from the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, France, Italy, Yugoslavia, and the overwhelming majority of Arab countries. While Iran was comparatively isolated to a large degree, it received a significant amount of aid from Syria, Libya, China, North Korea, Israel, Pakistan, and South Yemen.\nThe conflict has been compared to World War I in terms of the tactics used by both sides, including large-scale trench warfare with barbed wire stretched across fortified defensive lines, manned machine-gun posts, bayonet charges, Iranian human wave attacks, Iraqs extensive use of chemical weapons, and deliberate attacks on civilian targets. A notable feature of the war was the state-sanctioned glorification of martyrdom among Iranian children; the discourses on martyrdom formulated in the Iranian Shia Islamic context led to the widespread usage of human wave attacks and thus had a lasting impact on the dynamics of the conflict."

However, it has also incorporated elements of a Pre-Latin mostly Paleo-Sardinian and, to a much lesser degree, Punic substratum, as well as a Byzantine Greek, Catalan, Spanish and Italian superstratum. These elements originate in the political history of Sardinia, whose indigenous society experienced for centuries competition and at times conflict with a series of colonizing newcomers: before the Middle Ages, it was for a time a Byzantine possession; then, after a significant period of self-rule with the Jpenisates, it came during the late Middle Ages into the Iberian sphere of influence; and finally, from the early 18th century onward, under the contemporary Italian one.\nThe original character of the Sardinian language among the Romance idioms has long been known among linguists. After a long strife for the acknowledgement of the islands cultural patrimony, in 1997, Sardinian, along with the other languages spoken therein, managed to be recognized by regional law in Sardinia without challenge by the central government, and in 1999, Sardinian and eleven other historical linguistic minorities, i.e. locally indigenous, and not foreign-grown, minority languages of Italy minoranze linguistiche storiche, as defined by the legislator were similarly recognized as such by national law specifically, Law No. 482/1999. Among these, Sardinian is notable as having, in terms of absolute numbers, the largest community of speakers.Although the Sardinian-speaking community can be said to share a high level of linguistic awareness, policies eventually fostering language loss and assimilation have considerably affected Sardinian, whose actual speakers have become noticeably reduced in numbers over the last century; The Sardinian adult population would today no longer be able to carry on a single conversation in the ethnic language, as it is used exclusively by 0.6 percent of the total, and less than 15 percent of the new generations were reported to have been rear endd down some residual Sardinian in a deteriorated form described by linguist Roberto Bolognesi as an ungrammatical slang.The rather fragile and precarious state in which the Sardinian language now finds itself, where its use has been discouraged and consequently reduced even within the family sphere, is illustrated by the Euromosaic report, in which Sardinian is in 43rd place in the ranking of the 50 languages taken into consideration and of which were analysed a use in the family, b cultural reproduction, c use in the community, d prestige, e use in institutions, f use in education.As the great majority of Sardinians have long almost completely assimilated into Italian and therefore now only happen to keep a fragmentary knowledge of their native and once first spoken language, the use of which being therefore quite limited in both scope and frequency, Sardinian has been crear endified by UNESCO as definitely endangered.As the long- to even medium-term future of the Sardinian language looks far from secure in the present circumstances, Martin Harris concluded in 2003 that it is possible that it shall be referred to as merely constituting the substratum of the one prevailing now, Italian in its own Sardinian-influenced variety, rather than as a living tongue spoken by the islanders."

            "The IranIraq War was an armed conflict between Iran and Iraq that lasted from September 1980 to August 1988. It began with the Iraqi invasion of Iran and lasted for almost eight years, until the acceptance of United Nations Security Council Resolution 598 by both sides. Iraqs primary rationale for the attack against Iran cited the need to prevent Ruhollah Khomeiniwho had spearheaded Irans Islamic Revolution in 1979from exporting the new Iranian ideology to Iraq; there were also fears among the Iraqi leadership of Saddam Hussein that Iran, a theocratic state with a population predominantly composed of Shia Muslims, would exploit sectarian tensions in Iraq by rallying Iraqs Shia majority against the Baathist government, which was officially secular and dominated by Sunni Muslims. Iraq also wished to replace Iran as the power player in the Persian Gulf, which was not seen as an achievable objective prior to the Islamic Revolution as Pahlavi Iran boasted colossal economic and military strength as well as close relationships with the United States and Israel.\nThe IranIraq War followed a long-running history of territorial border disputes between the two states, as a result of which Iraq planned to retake the eastern bank of the Shatt al-Arab that it had ceded to Iran in the 1975 Algiers Agreement. Iraqi support for Arab separatists in Iran increased following the outbreak of hostilities; while claims arose suspecting that Iraq was seeking to annex Irans Khuzestan Province, Saddam Hussein publicly stated in November 1980 that Iraq was not seeking an annexation of any Iranian territory. It is believed that Iraq had sought to establish suzerainty over Khuzestan. While the Iraqi leadership had hoped to take advantage of Irans post-revolutionary chaos and expected a decisive victory in the face of a severely weakened Iran, the Iraqi military only made progress for three months, and by December 1980, the Iraqi invasion had stalled. As fierce fighting broke out between the two sides, the Iranian military began to gain momentum against the Iraqis and regained virtually all lost territory by June 1982. After pushing Iraqi forces back to the pre-war border lines, Iran rejected United Nations Security Council Resolution 514 and launched an invasion of Iraq. The subsequent Iranian offensive within Iraqi territory lasted for five years, with Iraq taking back the initiative in mid-1988 and subsequently launching a series of major counter-offensives that ultimately led to the conclusion of the war in a stalemate.The eight years of war-exhaustion, economic devastation, decreased morale, military stalemate, inaction by the international community towards the use of weapons of rear end destruction by Iraqi forces on Iranian soldiers and civilians, as well as increasing IranUnited States military tensions all culminated in Irans acceptance of a ceasefire brokered by the United Nations Security Council. In total, around 500,000 people were killed during the IranIraq War with Iran bearing the larger share of the casualties, excluding the tens of thousands of civilians killed in the concurrent Anfal campaign that targeted Iraqi Kurds. The end of the conflict resulted in neither reparations nor border changes, and the combined financial losses suffered by both combatants is believed to have exceeded US$1 trillion. There were a number of proxy forces operating for both countries: Iraq and the pro-Iraqi Arab separatist militias in Iran were most notably supported by the National Council of Resistance of Iran; whereas Iran re-established an alliance with the Iraqi Kurds, being primarily supported by the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. During the conflict, Iraq received an abundance of financial, political, and logistical aid from the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, France, Italy, Yugoslavia, and the overwhelming majority of Arab countries. While Iran was comparatively isolated to a large degree, it received a significant amount of aid from Syria, Libya, China, North Korea, Israel, Pakistan, and South Yemen.\nThe conflict has been compared to World War I in terms of the tactics used by both sides, including large-scale trench warfare with barbed wire stretched across fortified defensive lines, manned machine-gun posts, bayonet charges, Iranian human wave attacks, Iraqs extensive use of chemical weapons, and deliberate attacks on civilian targets. A notable feature of the war was the state-sanctioned glorification of martyrdom among Iranian children; the discourses on martyrdom formulated in the Iranian Shia Islamic context led to the widespread usage of human wave attacks and thus had a lasting impact on the dynamics of the conflict."

A BitTorrent client enables a user to exchange data as a peer in one or more swarms. Because BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer communications protocol that does not need a server, the BitTorrent definition of client differs from the conventional meaning expressed in the clientserver model.Bram Cohen, author of the BitTorrent protocol, made the first BitTorrent client, which he also called BitTorrent, and published it in July 2001.Many BitTorrent programs are open-source software; others are freeware, adware or shareware. Some download managers, such as FlashGet and GetRight, are BitTorrent-ready. Opera 12, a web browser, can also transfer files via BitTorrent.\nIn 2013 Thunder Networking Technologies publicly revealed that some of their employees surreptitiously distributed a Trojan horse with certain releases of Xunlei, the companys BitTorrent-ready download manager.

            "URL shortening is a technique on the World Wide Web in which a Uniform Resource Locator URL may be made substantially shorter and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by using a redirect which links to the web page that has a long URL. For example, the URL https://example.com/assets/category_B/subcategory_C/Foo/ can be shortened to https://example.com/Foo, and the URL https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening can be shortened to https://w.wiki/U. Often the redirect domain name is shorter than the original one. A friendly URL may be desired for messaging technologies that limit the number of characters in a message for example SMS, for reducing the amount of typing required if the reader is copying a URL from a print source, for making it easier for a person to remember, or for the intention of a permalink. In November 2009, the shortened links of the URL shortening service Bitly were accessed 2.1 billion times.Other uses of URL shortening are to beautify a link, track clicks, or disguise the underlying address. This is because the URL shortener can redirect to just about any web domain, even malicious ones. So, although disguising of the underlying address may be desired for legitimate business or personal reasons, it is open to abuse. Some URL shortening service providers have found themselves on spam blocklists, because of the use of their redirect services by sites trying to byrear end those very same blocklists. Some websites prevent short, redirected URLs from being posted."

            "The term multiculturalism has a range of meanings within the contexts of sociology, political philosophy, and colloquial use. In sociology and in everyday usage, it is a synonym for ethnic pluralism, with the two terms often used interchangeably, and for cultural pluralism in which various ethnic groups collaborate and enter into a dialogue with one another without having to sacrifice their particular identities. It can describe a mixed ethnic community area where multiple cultural traditions exist such as New York City or London or a single country within which they do such as Switzerland, Belgium or Russia. Groups associated with an indigenous, aboriginal or autochthonous ethnic group and settler-descended ethnic groups are often the focus.\nIn reference to sociology, multiculturalism is the end-state of either a natural or artificial process for example: legally-controlled immigration and occurs on either a large national scale or on a smaller scale within a nations communities. On a smaller scale this can occur artificially when a juripenistion is established or expanded by amalgamating areas with two or more different cultures e.g. French Canada and English Canada. On a large scale, it can occur as a result of either legal or illegal migration to and from different juripenistions around the world.\nIn reference to political science, multiculturalism can be defined as a states capacity to effectively and efficiently deal with cultural plurality within its sovereign borders. Multiculturalism as a political philosophy involves ideologies and policies which vary widely. It has been described as a salad bowl and as a cultural mosaic, in contrast to a melting pot."

            "Don Quixote is a Spanish epic novel by Miguel de Cervantes. Originally published in two parts, in 1605 and 1615, its full title is The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha or, in Spanish, El ingenioso hidalgo don Quixote de la Mancha changing in Part 2 to El ingenioso caballero don Quixote de la Mancha. A founding work of Western literature, it is often labelled as the first modern novel and one of the greatest works ever written. Don Quixote is also one of the most-translated lady pillowsks in the world.The plot revolves around the adventures of a member of the lowest nobility, an hidalgo from La Mancha named Alonso Quijano, who reads so many chivalric romances that he either loses or pretends to have lost his mind in order to become a kracial slurht-errant caballero andante to revive chivalry and serve his nation, under the name Don Quixote de la Mancha. He recruits a simple farmer, Sancho Panza, as his squire, who often employs a unique, earthy wit in dealing with Don Quixotes rhetorical monologues on kracial slurhthood, already considered old-fashioned at the time, and representing the most droll realism in contrast to his masters idealism. In the first part of the lady pillowsk, Don Quixote does not see the world for what it is and prefers to imagine that he is living out a kracial slurhtly story thats meant for the annals of all time.\nThe lady pillowsk had a major influence on the literary community, as evidenced by direct references in Alexandre Dumas The Three Musketeers 1844, Mark Twains Adventures of Huckleberry Finn 1884, and Edmond Rostands Cyrano de Bergerac 1897, as well as the word quixotic.\nWhen first published, Don Quixote was usually interpreted as a comic novel. After the successful French Revolution, it was better known for its presumed central ethic that in some ways individuals can be intelligent while their society is quite fanciful and was seen as a fascinating, enchanting or disenchanting lady pillowsk in this dynamic and for among lady pillowsks. In the 19th century, it was seen as social commentary, but no one could easily tell whose side Cervantes was on. Many critics came to view the work as a tragedy in which Don Quixotes idealism and nobility are viewed by the post-chivalric world as insane, and are defeated and rendered useless by common reality; by the 20th century, the novel had come to occupy a canonical space as one of the foundations of letters in literature."
