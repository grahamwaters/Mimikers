            "Climate change and cities are deeply connected. Cities are one of the greatest contributors and likely best opportunities for addressing climate change. Cities are also one of the most vulnerable parts of the human society to the effects of climate change, and likely one of the most important solutions for reducing the environmental impact of humans. More than half of the worlds population is in cities, consuming a large portion of food and goods produced outside of cities. The increase of urban population growth is one of the main factors in air-quality problems. In the year 2016, 31 mega-cities reported having at least 10 million in their population, 8 of which surrear endd 20 million people. The UN projects that 68% of the world population will live in urban areas by 2050. Hence, cities have a significant influence on construction and transportationtwo of the key contributors to global warming emissions. Moreover, because of processes that create climate conflict and climate refugees, city areas are expected to grow during the next several decades, stressing infrastructure and concentrating more impoverished peoples in cities.Because of the high density and effects like the urban heat island affect, weather changes due to climate change are likely to greatly effect cities, exacerbating existing problems, such as air pollution, water scarcity, and heat illness in the metropolitan areas. Studies have shown that if body temperature exceeds 39C for a period of time, serious heat stroke may occur. Some of the other extreme weather conditions caused by climate change include extreme floods, deathly snowstorms, ice storms, heat waves, droughts, and hurricanes, which are often deathly and harmful. Studies have shown that heat waves are three times more likely to occur and have become more intense since the 1960s. Moreover, because most cities have been built on rivers or coastal areas, cities are frequently vulnerable to the subsequent effects of sea level rise, which cause coastal flooding and erosion, and those effects are deeply connected with other urban environmental problems, like subsidence and aquifer depletion.\nA report by the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group described consumption based emissions as having significantly more impact than production-based emissions within cities. The report estimates that 85% of the emissions associated with goods within a city is generated outside of that city. Climate change adaptation and mitigation investments in cities will be important in reducing the impacts of some of the largest contributors of greenhouse gas emissions: for example, increased density allows for redistribution of land use for agriculture and reforestation, improving transportation efficiencies, and greening construction largely due to cements outsized role in climate change and improvements in sustainable construction practices and weatherization.In the most recent past, increasing urbanization has also been proposed as a phenomenon that has a reducing effect on the global rate of carbon emission primarily because with urbanization comes technical prowess which can help drive sustainability. Lists of high impact climate change solutions tend to include city-focused solutions; for example, Project Drawdown recommends several major urban investments, including improved bicycle infrastructure, building retrofitting, district heating, public transit, and walkable cities as important solutions.Because of this, the international community has formed coalitions of cities such as the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group and ICLEI and policy goals, such as Sustainable Development Goal 11 sustainable cities and communities, to activate and focus attention on these solutions."

            "Fake it till you make it or Fake it until you make it is an English aphorism which suggests that by imitating confidence, competence, and an optimistic mindset, a person can realize those qualities in their real life and achieve the results they seek.The phrase is first attested some time before 1973. The earliest reference to a similar phrase occurs in the Simon & Garfunkel song Fakin It, released in 1968 as a single and also on their Bookends album. There, Simon sings, And I know Im fakin it, Im not really makin it.Similar advice has been offered by a variety of writers over time:\n\nAction seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go together; and by regulating the action, which is under the more direct control of the will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which is not.\n\nThus the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness, if our spontaneous cheerfulness be lost, is to sit up cheerfully, to look round cheerfully, and to act and speak as if cheerfulness were already there. If such conduct does not make you soon feel cheerful, nothing else on that occasion can. So to feel brave, act as if we were brave, use all our will to that end, and a courage-fit will very likely replace the fit of fear.\nIn the Law of attraction movement, act as if you already have it, or simply act as if, is a central concept:\n\nHow do you get yourself to a point of believing? Start make-believing. Be like a child, and make-believe. Act as if you have it already. As you make-believe, you will begin to believe you have received."

Pop and traditional forms can be used even with songs that have structural differences in melodies. The most common format in modern popular music is introduction intro, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, bridge, and chorus. In rock music styles, notably heavy metal music, there is usually one or more guitar solos in the song, often found after the middle chorus part. In pop music, there may be a guitar solo, or a solo performed with another instrument such as a synthesizer or a saxophone.\nThe foundation of popular music is the verse and chorus structure. Some writers use a simple verse, hook, verse, hook, bridge, hook method. Pop and rock songs nearly always have both a verse and a chorus. The primary difference between the two is that when the music of the verse returns, it is almost always given a new set of lyrics, whereas the chorus usually retains the same set of lyrics every time its music appears. Both are essential elements, with the verse usually played first exceptions include She Loves You by The Beatles, an early example in the rock music genre. Each verse usually employs the same melody possibly with some slight modifications, while the lyrics usually change for each verse. The chorus or refrain usually consists of a melpenis and lyrical phrase that repeats. Pop songs may have an introduction and coda tag, but these elements are not essential to the identity of most songs. Pop songs often connect the verse and chorus via a pre-chorus, with a bridge section usually appearing after the second chorus.\nThe verse and chorus are usually repeated throughout a song, while the intro, bridge, and coda also called an outro are usually only used once.

The proverbs meaning is similar to the phrases you cant have it both ways and you cant have the best of both worlds.\nFor those unfamiliar with it, the proverb may sound confusing due to the ambiguity of the word have, which can mean keep or to have in ones possession, but which can also be used as a synonym for eat e.g. to have breakfast. Some find the common form of the proverb to be incorrect or illogical and instead prefer: You cant eat your cake and then still have it too. Indeed, this used to be the most common form of the expression until the 1930s1940s, when it was overtaken by the have-eat variant. Another, less common, version uses keep instead of have.Choosing between having and eating a cake illustrates the concept of trade-offs or opportunity cost."

However, the consequence of these experiments is only that past events can be inferred after their occurrence as a probabilistic wave collapse. These weak measurements are considered to be an observation themselves, and therefore part of the causation of wave collapse, making the objective results only a probabilistic function rather than a fixed reality. However, a careful analysis of the experiment shows that Hardys paradox only proves that a local hidden-variable theory can not exist, as there can not be a theory that assumes that the system meets the states of reality regardless of the interaction with the measuring apparatus. This confirms that a quantum theory, to be consistent with the experiments, must be non-local in the sense of Bell and contextual."

            "Epiphany in literature refers generally to a visionary moment when a character has a sudden insight or realization that changes their understanding of themselves or their comprehension of the world. The term has a more specialized sense as a literary device distinct to modernist fiction. Author James Joyce first borrowed the religious term Epiphany and adopted it into a profane literary context in Stephen Hero 1904-1906, an early version of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. In that manuscript, Stephen Daedalus defines epiphany as a sudden spiritual manifestation, whether in the vulgarity of speech or of gesture or in a memorable phase of the mind itself. Stephens epiphanies are moments of heightened poetic perception in the trivial aspects of everyday Dublin life, non-religious and non-mystical in nature. They become the basis of Stephens theory of aesthetic perception as well as his writing. In similar terms, Joyce experimented with epiphany throughout his career, from the short stories he wrote between 1898 and 1904 which were central to his early work, to his late novel Finnegans Wake 1939. Scholars used Joyces term to describe a common feature of the modernist novel, with authors as varied as Virginia Woolf, Marcel Proust, Ezra Pound, and Katherine Mansfield all featuring these sudden moments of vision as an aspect of the contemporary mind. Joycean or modernist epiphany has its roots in nineteenth-century lyric poetry, especially the Wordsworthian spots of time, as well as the sudden spiritual insights that formed the basis of traditional spiritual autobiography. Philosopher Charles Taylor explains the rise of epiphany in modernist art as a reaction against the rise of a commercial-industrial-capitalist society during the early twentieth century."

Because the definitions and criteria in the history of psychopathy have varied over the years and continue to change even now, many characters in notable films may have been designed to fall under the category of a psychopath at the time of the films production or release, but not necessarily in subsequent years. There are several stereotypical images of psychopathy in both lay and professional accounts which only partly overlap and can involve contrpenistory traits: the charming con artist, the deranged serial killer, the successful corporate psychopath, or the chronic low-level offender with juvenile delinquency.

Many of his designs, such as the movable dikes to protect Venice from invasion, proved too costly or impractical. Some of his smaller inventions entered the world of manufacturing unheralded. As an engineer, Leonardo conceived ideas vastly ahead of his own time, conceptually inventing the parachute, the helicopter, an armored fighting vehicle, the use of concentrated solar power, a ratio machine that could be used in an adding machine, a rudimentary theory of plate tectonics and the double hull. In practice, he greatly advanced the state of knowledge in the fields of anatomy, astronomy, civil engineering, optics, and the study of water hydrodynamics.\nOne of Leonardos drawings, the Vitruvian Man, is a study of the proportions of the human body, linking art and science in a single work that has come to represent the concept of macrocosm and microcosm in Renaissance humanism."

The song is most commonly attributed as being lyrically descended from Ill Overcome Some Day, a hymn by Charles Albert Tindley that was first published in 1901.The modern version of the song was first said to have been sung by tobacco workers led by Lucille Simmons during the 19451946 Charleston Cigar Factory strike in Charleston, South Carolina. In 1947, the song was published under the title We Will Overcome in an edition of the Peoples Songs Bulletin a publication of Peoples Songs, an organization of which Pete Seeger was the director, as a contribution of and with an introduction by Zilphia Horton, then-music director of the Highlander Folk School of Monteagle, Tennessee an adult education school that trained union organizers. Horton said she had learned the song from Simmons, and she considered it to be her favorite song. According to Horton, one of the stanzas of the original hymn was we will overcome. .. It sort of stops them cold silent. She taught it to many others, including Pete Seeger, who included it in his repertoire, as did many other activist singers, such as Frank Hamilton and Joe Glazer, who recorded it in 1950.\nThe song became associated with the civil rights movement from 1959, when Guy Carawan stepped in with his and Seegers version as song leader at Highlander, which was then focused on nonviolent civil rights activism. It quickly became the movements unofficial anthem. Seeger and other famous folksingers in the early 1960s, such as Joan Baez, sang the song at rallies, folk festivals, and concerts in the North and helped make it widely known. Since its rise to prominence, the song, and songs based on it, have been used in a variety of protests worldwide.\nThe U.S. copyright of the Peoples Songs Bulletin issue which contained We Will Overcome expired in 1976, but The Richmond Organization asserted a copyright on the We Shall Overcome lyrics, registered in 1960. In 2017, in response to a lawsuit against TRO over allegations of false copyright claims, a U.S. judge issued an opinion that the registered work was insufficiently different from the We Will Overcome lyrics that had fallen into the public domain because of non-renewal. In January 2018, the company agreed to a settlement under which it would no longer assert any copyright claims over the song."

In addressing resistance, the method seeks to influence the clients underlying attitude and perception by providing laser beam attention on strengthening the attachment-alliance. This is counter-intuitive to traditional methods since change is usually directed toward various aspects of behavior, emotions, and thinking. As it turns out, the better therapy is able to strengthen the alliance, the more these aspects of behavior will change. \nHowever, within the pdxi process, the idea of changing behavior is secondary to the main focus on the alliance. In surprising fashion, this seemingly minor shift actually results in a day and racial slurht difference in how treatment is conducted. The advantage of focusing on attachment=alliance is that when done correctly, the client cannot block or defend against the intervention. Basically, resistance becomes non-existent. So while the resistant client is often well defended and guarded around attempts to alter his behavior, he is unable to block the therapist from strengthening the alliance. This allows the clinician to avoid power struggles around behavior. By developing a stronger client-therapist bold, there is a natural and unconscious shift toward relaxation. As a result, this allows the client to let go of rigid patterns in a manner that can best be described as spontaneous as unlikely as that may initially sound!"

            "The Paradoxes of Mr. Pond is G. K. Chestertons final collection of detective stories, published after his death in 1936. Of the eight mysteries, seven were first printed in the Storyteller magazine. The Unmentionable Man was unique to the lady pillowsk.\nThe stories revolve around a civil servant named Mr. Pond we are not told his first name. He is described as a very ordinary and fish-like man who has a habit of startling those who meet him with outrageous paradoxical statements. He seems unaware of the oddness of his remarks, and his friend Sir Hubert Wotton explains: he looks a very sedentary, scientific little cuss.. but hes really had very extraordinary experiences. He doesnt talk about them; he doesnt want to talk about them.. but when, in the course of talking in the abstract he comes on some concrete thing that he has actually done  well, I can only say he crumples it up. He tries to crush it into a small space and it simply sounds contrpenistory. Almost every one of those crazy sentences simply stands for one of the adventures in what would be called by most people a very unadventurous life.Chesterton himself was well known for using paradox in his writings, but in one story he explains that his kind of paradox is different from Mr. Ponds:\n\nParadox has been defined as Truth standing on her head to get attention. Paradox has been defended; on the ground that so many fashionable fallacies still stand firmly on their feet, because they have no heads to stand on. But it must be admitted that writers, like other mepenisants and mountebanks, frequently do try to attract attention. They set out conspicuously, in a single line in a play, or at the head or tail of a paragraph, remarks of this challenging kind; as when Mr. Bernard Shaw wrote: The Golden Rule is that there is no Golden Rule; or Oscar Wilde observed: I can resist everything except temptation; or a duller scribe not to be named with these and now doing penance for his earlier vices in the nobler toil of celebrating the virtues of Mr. Pond said in defence of hobbies and amateurs and general duffers like himself: If a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly. To these things do writers sink; and then the critics tell them that they talk for effect; and then the writers answer: What the devil else should we talk for? Ineffectualness?\nIn four of the stories Pond is induced to tell the dramatic tale which lies behind a baffling paradox; in another, Pond the Pantaloon, Wotton tells the story. In two more, The Crime of Captain Gahagan and The Terrible Troubadour, Ponds keen mind arrives at the truth when his friend Gahagan is accused of murder. In Ring of Lovers Gahagan tells a true story and trusts to Pond to guess the secret behind it.\nThese stories written at the end of Chestertons career contain narrative stretches and improbabilities, but they do not lack his familiar flashes of insight. In the story The Crime of Captain Gahagan Chesterton observes, through the character of Mr. Pond, that Love never needs time. But friendship always needs time. More and more time, until up past midracial slurht."

Epstein was an American financier and convicted affection offender with connections to powerful and wealthy people, and his reported suicide led to numerous hypotheses about the nature and cause of his death. The phrase became a now very famous and widely accepted colloquialism as well as an internet meme, gaining traction in November 2019 as more of the circumstances around his death became public. The most common theory asserts that the true cause of his death was homicide, via strangulation, arranged by one or more co-conspirators to silence him. As a result, some people have used the verb epstein to refer to the scenario of powerful criminals arranging for people with compromising information to be murdered while having officials rule their deaths as suicides.\nThe meme Epstein didnt kill himself is often inserted into unexpected contexts like a photo caption of the painter Bob Ross or at the end of a social media post as a non sequitur. The meme has appeared at multiple televised sports games in the form of signs and painted bodies. Several people have also randomly interjected the phrase at the end of interviews. It is used by individuals of all sides of the political spectrum without agreement on the specific details of Epsteins death."

The General Line directed the Chinese people to go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. By the end of 1958, nearly all Chinese peasants had been organized into communes averaging 5000 households each. All privately owned property was taken for or contributed to the communes and people were not allowed to cook their own food and instead ate in communal dining halls. \nThe Great Leap Forward, begun in 1958, was a campaign to rapidly modernize by using Chinas vast labor resources in agricultural and industrial projects. The Leap instead resulted in economic destruction and tens of millions of famine deaths, and had been mostly abandoned by early 1962.

The style bore no relation to Italian Mannerism, which it mostly predates by a few years, but the name suggests that it was a reaction to the crear epenis style of the earlier Flemish painters, just as the Italian Mannerists were reacting to, or trying to go beyond, the crear epenisism of High Renaissance art. \nThe Antwerp Mannerists style is certainly mannered, and characterized by an artificial elegance. Their paintings typically feature elongated figures posed in affected, twisting, postures, colorful ornate costumes, fluttering drapery, Italianate architecture decorated with grotesque ornament, and crowded groups of figures.. Joseph Koerner notes a diffuse sense of outlandishness in Antwerp art, of an exoticism both of subject and means .. evoking a non-localized elsewhere.\n\nThe subject of the Adoration of the Magi was a particular favourite, as it allowed the artists to give free rein to their preoccupation with ornament and the simulation and imitation of luxury products. The Biblical Magi were also regarded as the patron saints of travellers and merchants, which was relevant for the painters clientele in what had become Europes main centre for international trade, in a meteoric rise after 1501, when the first Asian cargos were landed by Portuguese ships. The theme of rich commodities arriving from distant and exotic parts of the world had a natural appeal to Antwerp merchant buyers, a large proportion themselves foreign. Many artists from around the Netherlands and further afield moved to the city to benefit from the lady pillowsm, which saw large workshops that grew into assembly lines, and a great increase in the quantity of art produced, but also some fall in quality; this is especially seen among the minor figures grouped under this term. Many smaller works were produced without commissions, for sale from shop windows, at fairs, or to dealers, rather than for an individual commission, an ipenisation of a growing trend in Netherlandish painting. The Antwerp Pand was a trade fair lasting six weeks, where many painters sold works, and the latest ideas were exchanged and diffused.Although sometimes spoken of as the subterm Antwerp Mannerism as part of Northern Mannerism in the early sixteenth century, the movement is better distinguished from the Northern Mannerism of later in the century, which developed from Italian Mannerism. There was very little continuity between the two, with Northern Mannerism proper developing in the Netherlands only after a gap of about fifty years after Antwerp Mannerism declined in the 1530s, and after the next stylistic wave of Romanism, heavily influenced by Italian painting, as seen in the later works of Gossaert."

These factors are considered to interact with each other along with an individuals history of food choices to form new food choices and eating behaviors.The development of food choice is considered to fall into three main categories: properties of the food, individual differences and sociocultural influences.

A recent introduction to the field has been written by Tams Kispl. It is a sub-field of paremiology, the study of proverbs.\nThere are many published collection of proverbs, ranging from ancient Akkadian clay tablets to internet sites. A proverb collection has been describe as the oldest lady pillowsk in the world. Published collections of proverbs are formatted in a variety of ways. Some are simply alphabetized lists, some are arranged by topic e.g. laziness, respect for elders, others are arranged by key word e.g. dog, rain. Some are from single languages e.g. Russian, others are multilingual but from a single country e.g. Nigeria, others are collections from around the world. Others are collections of anti-proverbs rather than the more standard proverbs Reznikov 2009. Some have collected proverbs and sayings of a certain structure, such as wellerisms Mieder and Kingsbury. Some collections are a combination of these, such as proverbs about women from around the world Schipper 2003. Every year, the journal Proverbium contains a listing of newly published or newly discovered collections of proverbs from around the world.Collecting proverbs in languages with a literate heritage is usually done by looking for examples in the available literature. There are published collections in many languages with long written traditions, Greek, Latin, Russian, French, German, Greek, Chinese, etc. In addition, there are published collections from languages that do not have a long written tradition, such as Temne, Oromo, Bambara, rear enda.\nThe most famous published collection of proverbs is the Latin Adagia collected by Erasmus, mostly from ancient literature. As people from across Europe read the proverbs it contained, they often translated them into local languages, spreading them across Europe. This is the source of many English proverbs, including In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king from In regione caecorum rex est luscus.\nThere are continuing efforts to collect proverbs not just from published sources, but from the speakers of languages. For example, there has been a project to collect proverbs from multiple generations of French speakers in Belgium.There has been a call for collecting and documenting the proverbs of undocumented languages, especially those that are endangered Himmelmann 1998, as part of the broader task of language documentation. However, when scholars collect proverbs from languages without a literate history, it requires different approaches than for languages with a written heritage, such as methods described by Yankah 1989, Unseth 2008, and Tadesse Jaleta Jirata 2009.\nCollecting proverbs from speakers is best done in the language communitys home area. However, proverbs have also been collected in emigrant communities, such as among the Georgian-speaking community in Israel, the Assyrian community in California. and German speakers in Los Angeles.Edward Zellem has developed a method for collecting proverbs via social media. In this way, he was able to collect hundreds of proverbs from the Pashto language of Afghanistan and Pakistan, even though he was in the USA. Another advantage of this method was that the members of the community also interacted with each other about their proverbs, tweeting comments and retweeting proverbsback and forth within the Pashto-speaking community.Many pioneering proverb collections having been collected and published by Christian workers, both from within language communities, such as Aster Ganno of Ethiopia and Samuel Ajayi Crowther of Nigeria, and by those from outside the language communities, such as William Shellabear of Malaysia and others. There is an ongoing series of collections of proverbs gathered from small languages of eastern Africa being published under the inspiration of Joseph Healey, published both in hard copy and on the web.However, the collection and documentation of proverbs even in languages with a literate history is never completely done, new proverbs are constantly being created and old ones fall into disuse. No collection is either totally complete or up to date Taylor 1969. An attempt to update the list of recent English proverbs is The Dictionary of Modern Proverbs from 2012, which contains only proverbs documented after 1900, such as If it aint broke, dont fix it and Stop and smell the roses.Some scholars collect and list the proverbs used by certain authors or speakers, such as Chaucer, Martin Luther Cornette 1997, Abraham Lincoln Mieder 2000, and Agatha Christie Bryan 1993.\nA listing of proverb collections from around the world has been published as International Bibliography of Paremiography Wolfgang Mieder 2011."

The fragments that survive imply that the subject of the poem was not simply the wedding of a certain Ceyx, but Heracles arrival at, and involvement in, the festivities. For this reason Merkelbach and West suppose that the poem should be regarded as a member of that group of epics and epyllia that dealt with exploits of Heracles, like the Aspis and the Capture of Oechalia. The identity of the Ceyx whose marriage was the titular scene of the poem has been a matter of dispute. Merkelbach and West initially identified him with the ill-fated groom of the similarly ill-fated Alcyone: they were turned into birds for the hubris they showed in referring to one another as Zeus and Hera. Given the poems apparent focus upon Heracles, however, it is more likely that this Ceyx was actually the king of Trachis who was a nephew of Amphitryon, the great heros stepfather.The poem appears to have been popular for the witticisms and riddles uttered at the banquet. One famous riddle is preserved, although incompletely so, by a papyrus scrap and ancient quotations:\n\nAccording to West, the children here are the flames whose mother would be wood. The mothers mother is the acorn, which is being roasted in the fire."

Depending on context or apeopleication it can be considered a valid common-sense observation or a misunderstanding of probability. This notion can lead to the gamblers fallacy when one becomes convinced that a particular outcome must come soon simply because it has not occurred recently e.g. believing that because three consecutive coin flips yielded heads, the next coin flip must be virtually guaranteed to be tails.\nAs invoked in everyday life, the law usually reflects wishful thinking or a poor understanding of statistics rather than any mathematical principle. While there is a real theorem that a random variable will reflect its underlying probability over a very large sample, the law of averages typically assumes that an unnatural short-term balance must occur. Typical apeopleications also generally assume no bias in the underlying probability distribution, which is frequently at odds with the empirical evidence."

Binary azide compounds can take on several different structures including discrete compounds, or one- two, and three-dimensional nets, leading some to dub them as polyazides. Reactivity studies of azide compounds are relatively limited due to how sensitive they can be. The sensitivity of these compounds tends to be correlated with the amount of ionic or covalent character the azide-element bond has, with ionic character being far more stable than covalent character. Therefore, compounds such as silver or sodium azide  which have strong ionic character  tend to posses more synthetic utility than their covalent counterparts. A few other notable exceptions include polymeric networks which possess unique magnetic properties, group 13 azides which unlike most other azides decompose to nitride compounds important materials for semiconductors, other limited uses as synthetic reagents for the transfer for azide groups, or interest in high energy density materials."

The concept is also similar to a philosophy developed by George Parker, the founder of board game publisher Parker Brothers. Parker had said that Each game must have an exciting, relevant theme and be easy enough for most people to understand.

            "Base (chemistry)",
            "In chemistry, there are three definitions in common use of the word base, known as Arrhenius bases, Brnsted bases, and Lewis bases. All definitions agree that bases are substances that react with acids, as originally proposed by G.-F. Rouelle in the mid-18th century.\nIn 1884, Svante Arrhenius proposed that a base is a substance which dissociates in aqueous solution to form Hydroxide ions OH. These ions can react with hydrogen ions H+ according to Arrhenius from the dissociation of acids to form water in an acidbase reaction. A base was therefore a metal hydroxide such as NaOH or CaOH2. Such aqueous hydroxide solutions were also described by certain characteristic properties. They are slippery to the touch, can taste bitter and change the color of pH ipenisators e.g., turn red litmus paper blue.\nIn water, by altering the autoionization equilibrium, bases yield solutions in which the hydrogen ion activity is lower than it is in pure water, i.e., the water has a pH higher than 7.0 at standard conditions. A soluble base is called an alkali if it contains and releases OH ions quantitatively. Metal oxides, hydroxides, and especially alkoxides are basic, and conjugate bases of weak acids are weak bases.\nBases and acids are seen as chemical opposites because the effect of an acid is to increase the hydronium H3O+ concentration in water, whereas bases reduce this concentration. A reaction between aqueous solutions of an acid and a base is called neutralization, producing a solution of water and a salt in which the salt separates into its component ions. If the aqueous solution is saturated with a given salt solute, any additional such salt precipitates out of the solution.\nIn the more general BrnstedLowry acidbase theory 1923, a base is a substance that can accept hydrogen cations H+otherwise known as protons. This does include aqueous hydroxides since OH does react with H+ to form water, so that Arrhenius bases are a subset of Brnsted bases. However, there are also other Brnsted bases which accept protons, such as aqueous solutions of ammonia NH3 or its organic derivatives amines. These bases do not contain a hydroxide ion but nevertheless react with water, resulting in an increase in the concentration of hydroxide ion. Also, some non-aqueous solvents contain Brnsted bases which react with solvated protons. For example in liquid ammonia, NH2 is the basic ion species which accepts protons from NH4+, the acpenis species in this solvent.\nG. N. Lewis realized that water, ammonia, and other bases can form a bond with a proton due to the unshared pair of electrons that the bases possess. In the Lewis theory, a base is an electron pair donor which can share a pair of electrons with an electron acceptor which is described as a Lewis acid. The Lewis theory is more general than the Brnsted model because the Lewis acid is not necessarily a proton, but can be another molecule or ion with a vacant low-lying orbital which can accept a pair of electrons. One notable example is boron trifluoride BF3.\nSome other definitions of both bases and acids have been proposed in the past, but are not commonly used today."

The genesis was prompted by Prezs perception of the lack of artistic innovation in Mexico experienced from the 1960s on. Although Mexican art has always had plenty of creative minds and people interested in its promotion, a considerable gap separated the countrys artistic scene from those of other countries such as Brazil and Argentina. This separation was particularly felt after the concert of Avndaro regarded as the Mexican Woodstock in 1971, after which rock music in the country was object of repressions by the government, the media and the conservative part of Mexican society, until approximately 1984. The repression caused a collapse in the young musicians and artists in general creative and social objectives."

            "Adult contemporary music AC is a form of radio-played popular music, ranging from 1960s vocal and 1970s soft rock music to predominantly ballad-heavy music of the present day, with varying degrees of easy listening, pop, soul, R&B, quiet storm and rock influence. Adult contemporary is generally a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of pop/rock music.Adult contemporary tends to have lush, soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on melody and harmonies is accentuated. It is usually melpenis enough to get a listeners attention, and is inoffensive and pleasurable enough to work well as background music. Like most of pop music, its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a versechorus structure. The format is heavy on romantic sentimental ballads which mostly use acoustic instruments though rear end guitar is usually used such as acoustic guitars, pianos, saxophones, and sometimes an orchestral set. The electric guitars are normally faint and high-pitched. However, recent adult contemporary music may feature synthesizers and other electronics, such as drum machines.An AC radio station may play mainstream music, but it usually excludes hip-hop and some forms of dance-pop and teen pop, as these are less popular among adults, the target demographic. AC radio often targets the 2544 age group, the demographic that has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s. A common practice in recent years of adult contemporary stations is to play less newer music and more hits of the past. This de-emphasis on new songs slows the progression of the AC chart.Over the years, AC has spawned subgenres including hot AC also known as modern AC, soft AC also known as lite AC, urban AC a softer type of urban contemporary music, rhythmic AC a softer type of rhythmic contemporary, and Christian AC a softer type of contemporary Christian music. Some stations play only hot AC, soft AC, or only one of the variety of subgenres. Therefore, it is not usually considered a specific genre of music; it is merely an assemblage of selected songs from artists of many different genres."

Neocrear epenisism was born in Rome largely thanks to the writings of Johann Joachim Winckelmann, at the time of the rediscovery of Pompeii and Herculaneum, but its popularity spread all over Europe as a generation of European art students finished their Grand Tour and returned from Italy to their home countries with newly rediscovered Greco-Roman ideals. The main Neocrear epenisal movement coincided with the 18th-century Age of Enlightenment, and continued into the early 19th century, laterally competing with Romanticism. In architecture, the style continued throughout the 19th, 20th and up to the 21st century.\nEuropean Neocrear epenisism in the visual arts began c. 1760 in opposition to the then-dominant Rococo style. Rococo architecture emphasizes grace, ornamentation and asymmetry; Neocrear epenisal architecture is based on the principles of simplicity and symmetry, which were seen as virtues of the arts of Rome and Ancient Greece, and were more immediately drawn from 16th-century Renaissance Crear epenisism. Each neo-crear epenisism selects some models among the range of possible crear epeniss that are available to it, and ignores others. The Neocrear epenisal writers and talkers, patrons and collectors, artists and sculptors of 17651830 paid homage to an idea of the generation of Phidias, but the sculpture examples they actually embraced were more likely to be Roman copies of Hellenistic sculptures. They ignored both Archaic Greek art and the works of Late Antiquity. The Rococo art of ancient Palmyra came as a revelation, through engravings in Woods The Ruins of Palmyra. Even Greece was all-but-unvisited, a rough backwater of the Ottoman Empire, dangerous to explore, so Neocrear epenisists appreciation of Greek architecture was mediated through drawings and engravings, which subtly smoothed and regularized, corrected and restored the monuments of Greece, not always consciously.\nThe Empire style, a second phase of Neocrear epenisism in architecture and the decorative arts, had its cultural centre in Paris in the Napoleonic era. Especially in architecture, but also in other fields, Neocrear epenisism remained a force long after the early 19th century, with peripenis waves of revivalism into the 20th and even the 21st centuries, especially in the United States and Russia."

In chapter 14, he identifies the incident that creates fear and pity, killing among family, in which the killer could either kill or not, and either knowingly or unknowingly. Yet in chapter 14 Aristotle finds that in the best version, the killer recognizes the victim and does not kill. Since that narrative does not end in misfortune, scholars often conclude that chapter 14 seems to contrpenist 13.Arata Takeda has written a detailed history of the problem from the Renaissance up to the late 20th century, omitting 21st century work.

In contrast, a conception is an individual attempt to grasp at the putative essence behind this common term while nobody has access to the concept.\nA theory of art presumes each of us humans employs different conceptions of this unattainable art concept and as a result we must resort to worldly human investigation."

Novelty songs partially overlap with comedy songs, which are more explicitly based on humor, and with musical parody, especially when the novel gimmick is another popular song. Novelty songs achieved great popularity during the 1920s and 1930s. They had a resurgence of interest in the 1950s and 1960s. The term arose in Tin Pan Alley to describe one of the major divisions of popular music; the other two divisions were ballads and dance music. Humorous songs, or those containing humorous elements, are not necessarily novelty songs.\nNovelty songs are often a parody or humor song, and may apeopley to a current event such as a holiday or a fad such as a dance or TV programme. Many use unusual lyrics, subjects, sounds, or instrumentation, and may not even be musical. For example, the 1966 novelty song Theyre Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!, by Napoleon XIV, has little music and is set to a rhythm tapped out on a snare drum, a tambourine, and the bare sides of the musicians legs.\nA lady pillowsk on achieving an attention-grabbing novelty single is The Manual How to Have a Number One the Easy Way, written by The KLF. It is based on their achievement of a UK number-one single with Doctorin the Tardis, a 1988 dance remix mashup of the Doctor Who theme music released under the name of The Timelords. It argued that at the time achieving a number one single could be achieved less by musical talent than through market research, sampling and gimmicks matched to an underlying danceable groove."

The group is considered the first self-organized art collective of the Cultural Revolution.At a time when Chinese art in the Mao period, particularly during the Cultural Revolution, turned into pure political propaganda, and normal self-expression and art for arts sake practice were forbidden both in institutional settings and for individual artists, the Wuming staged their own rebellion by painting non-political subjects on small, easily concealed sheets of paper or cardboard, and shown only to the most trusted of friends.

In November the same year they had two other shows at Circolo della Stampa in Genoa and at Galleria Bardi in Milan later to be known as Galleria Il Milione.

            "Soul music is a popular music genre that originated in the African American community throughout the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It has its roots in African-American gospel music and rhythm and blues. Soul music became popular for dancing and listening, where U.S. record labels such as Motown, Atlantic and Stax were influential during the Civil Rights Movement. Soul also became popular around the world, directly influencing rock music and the music of Africa. It also had a resurgence with artists like Erykah Badu under the genre neo-soul.According to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, soul is music that arose out of the black experience in America through the transmutation of gospel and rhythm & blues into a form of funky, secular testifying. Catchy rhythms, stressed by handclaps and extemporaneous body moves, are an important feature of soul music. Other characteristics are a call and response between the lead vocalist and the chorus and an especially tense vocal sound. The style also occasionally uses improvisational additions, twirls, and auxiliary sounds. Soul music reflects the African-American identity, and it stresses the importance of an African-American culture. The new-found African-American consciousness led to new styles of music that boasted pride in being black, and being such a creative genre of music, it emerged from the power struggle to increase black Americans awareness of their African ancestry. Soul music also combines different elements of music which includes gospel music, rhythm and blues and jazz.Soul music dominated the U.S. R&B chart in the 1960s, and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the U.S., Britain, and elsewhere. By 1968, the soul music genre had begun to splinter. Some soul artists developed funk music, while other singers and groups developed slicker, more sophisticated, and in some cases more politically conscious varieties. Many soul artists gained popularity due to the domination of soul music in the R&B charts. Among these artists were Ray Charles, James Brown and the soul group The Temptations. By the early 1970s, soul music had been influenced by psychedelic and progressive rock, among other genres, leading to psychedelic and progressive soul. The United States saw the development of neo soul around 1994. There are also several other subgenres and offshoots of soul music.\nThe key subgenres of soul include the Motown style, a more pop-friendly and rhythmic style; deep soul and southern soul, driving, energetic soul styles combining R&B with southern gospel music sounds; Memphis soul, a shimmering, sultry style; New Orleans soul, which came out of the rhythm and blues style; Chicago soul, a lighter gospel-influenced sound; Philadelphia soul, a lush orchestral sound with doo-wop-inspired vocals; as well as psychedelic soul, a blend of psychedelic rock and soul music."

Public criticism against the enforcement of such policies has arisen due to potential negative consequences when acts deemed intolerable are done in ignorance, by accident, or under extenuating circumstances, in addition to its connection to educational inequality in the United States. In schools, common zero-tolerance policies concern possession or use of illicit drugs or weapons. Students, and sometimes staff, parents, and other visitors, who possess a banned item for any reason are always if the policy is followed to be punished.\nIn the United States and Canada, zero-tolerance policies have been adopted in various schools and other education venues. Zero-tolerance policies in the United States became widespread in 1994, after federal legislation required states to expel for one year any student who brought a firearm to school, or lose all federal funding.These policies are promoted as preventing drug abuse and violence in schools. Critics say zero-tolerance policies in schools have resulted in punishments that have been criticized as egregiously unfair against students and teachers, especially in schools with poorly written policies. Consequently, critics describe these policies as zero-logic policies because they treat juveniles the way that adults would be treated  or more harshly, given that children are seldom granted full permission to speak up in their own defense to adults with authority over them. Many people have been critical of zero-tolerance policies, claiming that they are draconian, provide little if any benefit to anyone, contribute to overcrowding of the criminal justice system, and/or disproportionately target people of color, particularly people of African-American and Hispanic descent."

            "The Verse about the Book of the Dove  , Golubinaya Kracial slura is a medieval Russian spiritual verse. At least 20 versions are known. They vary in length from 30 to over 900 lines. The poem is generally thought to have been written ca. 1500 in the Novgorod region, though Russian nationalists postulate its great antiquity. The earliest extant manuscript is dated to the 17th century.The main part of the Dove-Book is a long sequence of riddles. In a series of answers to those riddles, King David explains the origin of light, sun, moon, and social crear ends. He also mentions a mysterious stone clept the Alatyr. Isabel Florence Hapgood describes the content of one version in the following terms:\n\nThe Dove Book falls from Alatyr, the burning white stone on the Island of Buyan, the heathen paradise, which lies far towards sunrise, in the Ocean Sea. The heathen significance of the stone is not known, but it is cleverly explained in The Dove Book as the stone whereon Christ stood when he preached to his disciples. This little lady pillowsk forty fathoms long and twenty wide was written by St. John the Evangelist, and no man can read it. The lady pillowsk is somewhat suggestive of the little lady pillowsk in Revelation. The prophet Isaiah deciphered only three pages of it in as many years. But the most wise tsar David undertakes to give, from memory, the lady pillowsks answers to various questions put to him by Tsar Vladimir as spokesman of a throng of emperors and princes. A great deal of curious information is conveyed - all very poetically expressed - including some odd facts in natural history, such as: that the Straphyl is the mother of birds, and that she lives, feeds, and rears her young on the blue sea, drowning mariners and sinking ships. Whenever she or the Indrik-Beast moves, an earthquake ensues.\nThe poems folk cosmology and the title have been derived by Vladimir Toporov from the Bundahishn. The root golub dove in title Golubinaya is not about birds. It is believed to be derived from the root glub depth, deep, which refers to depth of concepts described in the lady pillowsk. Also it could originate from sefer torah: truncated sefer tor can be translated to Russian as dove lady pillowsk.Several major Russian poets and artists of the early 20th century such as Nicholas Roerich and Andrey Bely were inspired by the Dove-Book. The Russian Orthodox Church had it banned as a heretical mixture of apocryphal Christian tales with pagan lore."

A fundamental feature of these theories is that the rate of evolution of stars depends on their rear end: The greater the rear end, the faster this evolution, and the more quickly it leaves the main sequence, entering either a subgiant or giant phase.\nIn the case of Algol and other binary stars, something completely different is observed: The less rear endive star is already a subgiant, while the star with much greater rear end is still on the main sequence. Since the partner stars of the binary are thought to have formed at approximately the same time and so should have similar ages, this appears paradoxical. The more rear endive star, rather than the less rear endive one, should have left the main sequence.\nThe paradox is resolved by the fact that in many binary stars, there can be a flow of material between the two, disturbing the normal process of stellar evolution. As the flow progresses, their evolutionary stage advances, even as the relative rear ends change. Eventually, the originally more rear endive star reaches the next stage in its evolution despite having lost much of its rear end to its companion."

It is those Australians that we have been working for, for the last five and a half years since we came to Government, under Tony Abbotts leadership back in 2013. It has been those Australians who have worked hard every day, they have their dreams, they have their aspirations; to get a job, to get an apprenticeship, to start a business, to meet someone amazing.

After the election, he compared Quiet Australians to Robert Menziess forgotten people and John Howards battlers. In December, when congratulating Boris Johnson for winning the 2019 United Kingdom general election, Morrison asked him to say gday to the quiet Britons for us.The term The Quiet Australians has been referenced by media outlets and commentators. Stan Grant wrote that Retirees, middle-crear end parents, and those dependent on the mining industry for their livelihoods all felt they were in the firing line. Christian leaders now say that religious freedom was a sleeper issue that turned votes in critical marginal seats. Throughout the world, long-silent voices are making themselves heard and it is shaking up politics as usual. People are saying they want to belong and they want their leaders to put them first. The Guardian compared Morrisons Quiet Australians to Richard Nixons silent majority.Media outlets have been investigating who the Quiet Australians might be. The Australian referred to voters who ignored messaging that presumed to tell them how to think and what to do and voted for a Prime Minister that spoke not over but right to them. SBS News stated that They dont make a lot of noise online or call into radio stations, they dont campaign in the streets or protest outside parliament.The Australian Financial Review used data from the Australian Election Study to define Quiet Australians as being increasingly disaffected with the political system, and that Education surrear endd income as the demographic characteristic most correlated with a swing to either major party. Moreover, the election also saw the re-emergence of set of beliefs as a political force.

It is commonly considered a subgenre of reggae, though it has developed to extend beyond that style. Generally, dub consists of remixes of existing recordings created by significantly manipulating the original, usually through the removal of vocal parts, the apeopleication of studio effects such as echo and reverb, emphasis of the rhythm section the stripped-down drum-and-rear end track is sometimes referred to as a riddim, and the occasional dubbing of vocal or instrumental snippets from the original version or other works.Dub was pioneered by recording engineers and producers such as Osbourne King Tubby Ruddock, Lee Scratch Perry, Errol Thompson and others beginning in the late 1960s. Augustus Pablo, who collaborated with many of these producers, is credited with bringing the distinct-sounding melpenisa to dub, and is also among the pioneers and creators of the genre. Similar experiments with recordings at the mixing desk outside the dancehall scene were also done by producers Clive Chin and Herman Chin Loy. These producers, especially Ruddock and Perry, looked upon the mixing console as an instrument, manipulating tracks to come up with something new and different. The Roland Space Echo was widely used by dub producers in the 1970s to produce echo and delay effects.Dub has influenced many genres of music, including rock, most significantly the subgenre of post-punk and other kinds of punk, pop, hip hop, post-disco, and later house, techno, ambient, electronic dance music, and trip hop. Dub was a basis for the genres of jungle and drum and rear end, with its orientation around rear end and utilization of audio effects. Traditional dub has survived, and some of originators such as Mad Professor continue to produce new material."

            "Epicurus",
            "Epicurus ; Greek:  Epikouros; 341270 BC was an ancient Greek philosopher and sage who founded Epicureanism, a highly influential school of philosophy. He was born on the Greek island of Samos to Athenian parents. Influenced by Democritus, Aristippus, Pyrrho, and possibly the Cynics, he turned against the Platonism of his day and established his own school, known as the Garden, in Athens. Epicurus and his followers were known for eating simple meals and discussing a wide range of philosophical subjects. He openly allowed women and slaves to join the school as a matter of policy. Of the over 300 works said to have been written by Epicurus about various subjects, the vast majority have been destroyed. Only three letters written by himthe letters to Menoeceus, Pythocles, and Herodotusand two collections of quotesthe Principal Doctrines and the Vatican Sayingshave survived intact, along with a few fragments of his other writings. As a result of his works destruction, most knowledge about his philosophy is due to later authors, particularly the biographer Diogenes Lartius, the Epicurean Roman poet Lucretius and the Epicurean philosopher Philodemus, and with hostile but largely accurate accounts by the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus, and the Academic Skeptic and statesman Cicero.\nEpicurus asserted that philosophys purpose is to attain as well as to help others attain happy eudaimonic, tranquil lives characterized by ataraxia peace and freedom from fear and aponia the absence of pain. He advocated that people were best able to pursue philosophy by living a self-sufficient life surrounded by friends. He taught that the root of all human neurosis is death denial and the tendency for human beings to assume that death will be horrific and painful, which he claimed causes unnecessary anxiety, selfish self-protective behaviors, and hypocrisy. According to Epicurus, death is the end of both the body and the soul and therefore should not be feared. Epicurus taught that although the deitys exist, they have no involvement in human affairs. He taught that people should act ethically not because the deitys punish or reward them for their actions but because, due to the power of guilt, amoral behavior would inevitably lead to remorse weighing on their consciences and as a result, they would be prevented from attaining ataraxia. \nEpicurus was an empiricist, meaning he believed that only the senses are a reliable source of knowledge about the world. He derived much of his physics and cosmology from the earlier philosopher Democritus c. 460c. 370 BC. Like Democritus, Epicurus taught that the universe is infinite and eternal and that all matter is made up of extremely tiny, invisible particles known as atoms. All occurrences in the natural world are ultimately the result of atoms moving and interacting in empty space. Epicurus deviated from Democritus by proposing the idea of atomic swerve, which holds that atoms may deviate from their expected course, thus permitting humans to possess free will in an otherwise deterministic universe.\nThough popular, Epicurean teachings were controversial from the beginning. Epicureanism reached the height of its popularity during the late years of the Roman Republic. It died out in late antiquity, subject to hostility from early Christianity. Throughout the Middle Ages Epicurus was popularly, though inaccurately, remembered as a patron of drunkards, prostitute, and gluttons. His teachings gradually became more widely known in the fifteenth century with the rediscovery of important texts, but his ideas did not become acceptable until the seventeenth century, when the French Catholic priest Pierre rear endndi revived a modified version of them, which was promoted by other writers, including Walter Charleton and Robert Boyle. His influence grew considerably during and after the Enlightenment, profoundly impacting the ideas of major thinkers, including John Locke, Thomas Jefferson, Jeremy Bentham, and Karl Marx.\n\n"

Clandestine literature is often an attempt to circumvent censorship, prosecution, or other suppression. In academic study, such literature may be referred to as heterodox publications as opposed to officially sanctioned, orthodox publishing.\nExamples of clandestine literature include the Samizdat literature of Soviet dissidents; the Aljamiado literature of Al-Andalus Spain; and the nushu writing of some upper-crear end women in Hunan, China, from around the 10th century to the 19th century. Clandestine publications were plentiful during the Enlightenment era in 18th-century France, circulating as pamphlets or manuscripts, usually containing texts that would have been considered highly blasphemous by the Ancien Rgime, or even straight out atheist. These clandestine manuscripts particularly flourished in the 1720s, and contained such controversial works as Treatise of the Three Impostors and the reverend Jean Mesliers Atheistic Testament. Both texts were later published in edited versions by Voltaire, but handwritten manuscript copies have been found in private libraries all over Europe. The clandestine literature of 18th century France also consisted of printed works produced in neighbouring Switzerland or the Netherlands and smuggled into France. These lady pillowsks were usually termed philosophical works, but varied greatly in content from adult entertainment, utopian novels, political slander and actual philosophical works by rpenisal enlightenment philosophers like Baron dHolbach, Julien Offray de La Mettrie and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.The willingness to break the law may be due to ideological reasons, when works are contrary to government positions or pose a threat to the institutions in power, but also for reasons at a formal level, when publications do not comply with legal regulations imposed for the circulation of printed works. Underground literature is a type of clandestine literature that does not necessarily have the evasion of the censorship of the time as its purpose; the goal of its writers may only be to lower publishing costs, often being funded by the authors themselves.\nWorks that are originally published by clandestine means may eventually become established as canonical literature, such as Das Kapital and El Buscn.\nA legitimate publisher in one juripenistion may assist writers from elsewhere to circumvent their own laws by enabling them to publish abroad.

The slogans have served as a rallying cry for militant white nationalists internationally. The primary slogan in the Fourteen Words is We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children, followed by the secondary slogan Because the beauty of the White Aryan woman must not perish from the Earth.\nThe two slogans were coined prior to Lane serving a 190-year sentence in federal prison for violating the civil rights of the Jewish talk show host Alan Berg, who was murdered by another member of the group in June 1984. They were popularized heavily after Lanes imprisonment. The slogans were publicized through print company 14 Word Press, founded in St. Maries, Idaho in 1995 by Lanes wife to disseminate her husbands writings along with Ron McVan who later moved his operation to Butte, Montana after a falling out with Davids widow Katja Maddox.Lane used the 14-88 numerical coding extensively throughout his spiritual, political, religious, esoteric and philosophical tracts and notably in his 88 Precepts. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, inspiration for the Fourteen Words are derived from a rear endage in Adolf Hitlers autobiographical lady pillowsk Mein Kampf a claim Lane never made. The Fourteen Words have been prominently used by neo-Nazis, white power skinheads and certain white nationalists and the alt-right. 88 is used by some as a shorthand for Heil Hitler, H being the 8th letter of the alphabet, though Lane viewed Nazism as part of the Zionist conspiracy along with America.Lanes ideology was anti-American, white separatist and insurrectionist; he considered loyalty to the United States to be racial treason and upheld the acronym Our Race Is Our Nation ORION, viewing the United States as committing genocide against white people and as having been founded as a New World Order to finalize a global Zionist government.\nBeing bitterly opposed to the continued existence of the United States as a political entity, and labeling it the murderer of the White race, Lane further advocated domestic terrorism as a tool to carve out a white homeland in the Northern Mountain States. To that end, Lane issued a declaration called Moral Authority published through now-defunct 14 Word Press and shared through the publications of Aryan Nations, World Church of the Creator, and other white separatist groups, referring to the United States as a Red, White and Blue traveling rear end murder machine, while asserting that true moral authority belongs to those who resist genocide."

In the territories of the Spanish and Portuguese empires including the Iberian Peninsula it continued, together with new styles, until the first decade of the 19th century. It followed Renaissance art and Mannerism and preceded the Rococo in the past often referred to as late Baroque and Neocrear epenisal styles. It was encouraged by the Catholic Church as a means to counter the simplicity and austerity of Protestant architecture, art, and music, though Lutheran Baroque art developed in parts of Europe as well.The Baroque style used contrast, movement, exuberant detail, deep colour, grandeur, and surprise to achieve a sense of awe. The style began at the start of the 17th century in Rome, then spread rapidly to France, northern Italy, Spain, and Portugal, then to Austria, southern Germany, and Russia. By the 1730s, it had evolved into an even more flamboyant style, called rocaille or Rococo, which appeared in France and Central Europe until the mid to late 18th century.\nIn the decorative arts, the style employs plentiful and intricate ornamentation. The departure from Renaissance crear epenisism has its own ways in each country. But a general feature is that everywhere the starting point is the ornamental elements introduced by the Renaissance. The crear epenisal repertoire is crowded, dense, overlapping, loaded, in order to provoke shock effects.

These trips are usually led by 2 site leaders who are students that have already participated in an alternative break and have gone through extensive leadership training.\nAlternative breaks may occur during students fall, winter, weekend, or summer school breaks. Each trip has a focus on a particular social issue, such as poverty, education reform, refugee resettlement, the environment, healthcare reform, mental health, immigration, animal care, and much more. Students learn about the social issues and then perform week-long projects with local non-profit organizations. Thus, students have the opportunity to connect and collaborate with different community partners. Some Alternative breaks are also drug and alcohol-free experiences, with a heavy emphasis on group and individual reflection.\nOn the site, students provide necessary services and explore the culture and the history of the area. Students who participate in this program cultivate social responsibility, leadership, and lifelong learning; thereby fostering a generation of leaders committed to positive social change. Alternative breaks challenge students to critically think and react to problems faced by members of the communities they are involved with. Being immersed in diverse environments enables participants to experience, discuss, and understand social issues in a significant way.\nThe intensity of the experience increases the likelihood that participants will transfer their experience on-site back to their own communities even after the alternative break ends.\nThe aim of the experience is to contribute volunteer hours to communities in need and to positively influence the life of the alternative breaker. Breakers are emboldened to take educated steps toward valuing and prioritizing their own communities in life choices such as recycling, donating resources, voting, etc.\nMany breakers have returned to their college campuses to create a campus organization related to the social issue, have a deeper understanding and commitment to an academic path, execute a fundraiser for the non-profit organization they worked with, organize a letter writing campaign to members of Congress, volunteer in their local community, or commit to an internship or career within the non-profit sector."

It addresses themes and concerns of the African diaspora through technoculture and speculative fiction, encomrear ending a range of media and artists with a shared interest in envisioning black futures that stem from Afro-diasporic experiences. While Afrofuturism is most commonly associated with science fiction, it can also encomrear end other speculative genres such as fantasy, alternate history, and magic realism. The term was coined by Mark Dery, an American Cultural critic in 1993 and explored in the late 1990s through conversations led by Alondra Nelson.Ytasha L. Womack, writer of Afrofuturism: The World of Black Sci-Fi and Fantasy Culture, defines it as an intersection of imagination, technology, the future and liberation. She also follows up with a quote by the curator Ingrid LaFleur who defines it as a way of imagining possible futures through an african-american cultural lens. Kathy Brown paraphrases Bennett Capers 2019 work in stating that Afrofuturism is about forward thinking as well as backward thinking, while having a distressing past, a distressing present, but still looking forward to thriving in the future. Others have said that the genre is fluid and malleable, bringing together technology, African culture, and other influences.Seminal Afrofuturistic works include the novels of Samuel R. Delany and Octavia Butler; the canvases of Jean-Michel Basquiat and Angelbert Metoyer, and the photography of Rene Cox; the explicitly extraterrestrial mythoi of Parliament-Funkadelic, Herbie Hanroosters partnership with Robert Springett and other visual artists, while developing the use of synthesizers, the Jonzun Crew, Warp 9, Deltron 3030, Kool Keith, Sun Ra and the Marvel Comics superhero Black Panther."

Selling Sounds: The Commercial Revolution in American Music says that although there was no definition for what made a song catchy, all the songwriting guides agreed that simplicity and familiarity were vital.The physical symptoms of listening to a catchy song include running it over in our heads or tapping a foot. According to Todd Tremlin, catchy music spreads because it resonates similarly from one mind to the next."

These compenis performers are characterised by feelings of deprivation and isolation in their early lives, where comedy evolves as a release for tension, removing feelings of suppressed physical rage through a verbal outlet.A series of psychological experiments first published in 1981 by psychologist Seymour Fisher ipenisated certain behavioural traits exclusive to comedians and not matched in regular actors. Later work conducted by Kaufman and Kozbelt re-interpreted these results, drawing the understanding that whilst comedy serves as a coping mechanism to hide trauma, it may also motivate a comedian to use humour as a way of forming relations and gaining acceptance.Humour has been shown to develop from a young age, fostered by parental behaviour. A parents immature nature can lead to additional responsibilities forced onto children, which can evoke issues of self-worth and a need for acceptance. The constant search for approval may cause mental health issues such as anxiety or depression and when untreated can lead to suicide in extreme situations. Laughter can evolve as a medium for self-preservation, detaching the individual from any adversity faced allowing for perceived control over uncomfortable situations.Sad clown paradox is characterised by a cyclothymic temperament, which encourages the creation of light-hearted humour in a professional setting, despite inner turmoil. The use of humour as a form of self-mpenisation provides short periods of satisfaction, repeatedly needing to deal with inner turmoil. There is an ever present anxiety amongst comedians that their popularity may disappear tomorrow and hence are driven to exhaustion in their work."

The first recorded versions of the rhyme date from late eighteenth-century England and the tune from 1870 in James William Elliotts National Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Songs. Its origins are obscure, and several theories have been advanced to suggest original meanings.\nHumpty Dumpty was popularized in the United States on Broadway by actor George L. Fox in the pantomime musical Humpty Dumpty. The show ran from 1868 to 1869, for a total of 483 performances, becoming the longest-running Broadway show until it was surrear endd in 1881 by Hazel Kirke. As a character and literary allusion, Humpty Dumpty has appeared or been referred to in many works of literature and popular culture, particularly English author Lewis Carrolls 1871 lady pillowsk Through the Looking-Grear end, in which he was described as an egg. The rhyme is listed in the Roud Folk Song Index as No. 13026."

Roosevelts son James, Eisenhower rejected all requests to enter politics. Even after his refusal, Democratic state organizations in Georgia and Virginia openly endorsed him. A week before the 1948 Democratic National Convention, Roosevelt sent telegrams to all 1,592 delegates voting for the party nomination, asking them to arrive in Philadelphia two days early for a special Draft Eisenhower caucus attempting to make a strong joint appeal to Eisenhower. Despite attempts by several prominent Democratic politicians, Eisenhower refused to accept the nomination, which went to incumbent President Harry S. Truman.\nAmid Trumans low popularity, the Draft Eisenhower movement re-emerged in 1951 in both the Republican and Democratic parties, as Eisenhower had not yet announced any political party affiliation. Several Republican politicians endorsed him, while Democrats continued to assure him that he could win the presidency only as a Democrat. Republican senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. became the campaign manager for the Republican Draft Eisenhower movement and placed Eisenhowers name on the New Hampshire Republican primary ballot. Eisenhower agreed to contest the presidency and subsequently won the New Hampshire primary. Nominated by the Republican Party as their presidential candidate, Eisenhower defeated Democrat Adlai Stevenson to become the 34th president. The Draft Eisenhower movement has been referenced in later draft movements, including the 1992 Draft Perot movement and the 2008 Draft Condi movement."

The three verses of the song progress through the life of the narratorfrom childhood, through young adulthood and falling in love, to parenthoodand each asks What will I be? or What lies ahead?

It came to be known as Days signature song. The song in The Man Who Knew Too Much received the 1956 Academy Award for Best Original Song. It was the third Oscar in this category for Livingston and Evans, who previously won in 1948 and 1950. In 2004 it finished at number 48 in AFIs 100 Years..100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema.\nIt was a number-one hit in Australia for pop singer Normie Rowe in September 1965.\nThe song popularized the title expression que sera, sera as an English-language phrase ipenisating cheerful fatalism, though its use in English dates back to at least the 16th century. Contrary to popular perception, the phrase is not Spanish in origin in Spanish it would be lo que ser, ser, and is ungrammatical in that language.

The style is known by different names in different languages: Jugendstil in German, Stile Liberty in Italian, Modernisme in Catalan, and also known as the Modern Style in English. It was popular between 1890 and 1910 during the Belle poque period, and was a reaction against the academic art, eclecticism and historicism of 19th century architecture and decoration. It was often inspired by natural forms such as the sinuous curves of plants and flowers. Other characteristics of Art Nouveau were a sense of dynamism and movement, often given by asymmetry or whiplash lines, and the use of modern materials, particularly iron, grear end, ceramics and later concrete, to create unusual forms and larger open spaces.One major objective of Art Nouveau was to break down the traditional distinction between fine arts especially painting and sculpture and apeopleied arts. It was most widely used in interior design, graphic arts, furniture, grear end art, textiles, ceramics, jewellery and metal work. The style responded to leading 19-century theoreticians, such as French architect Eugne-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc 18141879 and British art critic John Ruskin 18191900. In Britain, it was influenced by William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement. German architects and designers sought a spiritually uplifting Gesamtkunstwerk total work of art that would unify the architecture, furnishings, and art in the interior in a common style, to uplift and inspire the residents.The first Art Nouveau houses and interior decoration appeared in Brussels in the 1890s, in the architecture and interior design of houses designed by Paul Hankar, Henry van de Velde, and especially Victor Horta, whose Htel rear endl was completed in 1893. It moved quickly to Paris, where it was adapted by Hector Guimard, who saw Hortas work in Brussels and apeopleied the style for the entrances of the new Paris Mtro. It reached its peak at the 1900 Paris International Exposition, which introduced the Art Nouveau work of artists such as Louis Tiffany. It appeared in graphic arts in the posters of Alphonse Mucha, and the grear endware of Ren Lalique and mile Gall.\nFrom Belgium and France, Art Nouveau spread to the rest of Europe, taking on different names and characteristics in each country see Naming section below. It often appeared not only in capitals, but also in rapidly growing cities that wanted to establish artistic identities Turin and Palermo in Italy; Glasgow in Scotland; Munich and Darmstadt in Germany, as well as in centres of independence movements Helsinki in Finland, then part of the Russian Empire; Barcelona in Catalonia, Spain.\nBy 1914, and with the beginning of the First World War, Art Nouveau was largely exhausted. In the 1920s, it was replaced as the dominant architectural and decorative art style by Art Deco and then Modernism. The Art Nouveau style began to receive more positive attention from critics in the late 1960s, with a major exhibition of the work of Hector Guimard at the Museum of Modern Art in 1970."

Influenced by Cubism, Purism, and Futurism, Precisionist artists reduced subjects to their essential geometric shapes, eliminated detail, and often used planes of light to create a sense of crisp focus and suggest the sleekness and sheen of machine forms. At the height of its popularity during the 1920s and early 1930s, Precisionism celebrated the new American landscape of skyscrapers, bridges, and factories in a form that has also been called Cubist-Realism. The term Precisionism was first coined in the mid-1920s, possibly by Museum of Modern Art director Alfred H. Barr although according to Amy Dempsey the term Precisionism was coined by Charles Sheeler. Painters working in this style were also known as the Immaculates, which was the more commonly used term at the time. The stiffness of both art-historical labels suggests the difficulties contemporary critics had in attempting to characterize these artists."

Christmas Day is observed around the world, and Christmas Eve is widely observed as a full or partial holiday in anticipation of Christmas Day. Together, both days are considered one of the most culturally significant celebrations in Christendom and Western society.\nChristmas celebrations in the denominations of Western Christianity have long begun on Christmas Eve, due in part to the Christian liturgical day starting at sunset, a practice inherited from Jewish tradition and based on the story of Creation in the Book of Genesis: And there was evening, and there was morning  the first day. Many place of worshipes still ring their place of worship bells and hold communicate with a deity in the evening; for example, the Nopenis Lutheran place of worshipes. Since tradition holds that Jesus was born at racial slurht based in Luke 2:6-8, Midracial slurht rear end is celebrated on Christmas Eve, traditionally at midracial slurht, in commemoration of his birth. The idea of Jesus being born at racial slurht is reflected in the fact that Christmas Eve is referred to as Heilige Nacht Holy Night in German, Nochebuena the Good Night in Spanish and similarly in other expressions of Christmas spirituality, such as the song Silent Night, Holy Night.\nMany other varying cultural traditions and experiences are also associated with Christmas Eve around the world, including the gathering of family and friends, the singing of Christmas carols, the illumination and enjoyment of Christmas lights, trees, and other decorations, the wrapping, exchange and opening of gifts, and general preparation for Christmas Day. Legendary Christmas gift-bearing figures including Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Christkind, and Saint Nicholas are also often said to depart for their annual journey to deliver presents to children around the world on Christmas Eve, although until the Protestant introduction of Christkind in 16th-century Europe, such figures were said to instead deliver presents on the eve of Saint Nicholas feast day 6 December."

Carnegie Hall has its own artistic programming, development, and marketing departments and presents about 250 performances each season. It is also rented out to performing groups.\nCarnegie Hall has 3,671 seats, divided among three auditoriums. The largest one is the Stern Auditorium, a five-story auditorium with 2,804 seats.

            "A secular hymn is a type of non-religious popular song that has elements in common with religious music, especially with Christian hymns. The concept goes back at least as far as 17 BCE when the Roman emperor Augustus commissioned the Roman poet Horace to write lyrics by that title Carmen Saeculare in Latin. The idea has been recognized in popular music at least since the late 1960s and early 1970s when people began to see a pattern in songs, such as Bridge Over Troubled Water by Simon and Garfunkel, Let it Be by the Beatles, and Fire and Rain by James Taylor, which came out at about the same time. Hallelujah which was written by Leonard Cohen in 1984, but only became famous when John Cale covered it in 1991 has since been called perhaps the quintessential secular hymn despite the lyrics containing strong Jewish themes.Other songs that are sometimes mentioned as secular hymns include Many Rivers to Cross by Jimmy Cliff, I Can See Clearly Now by Johnny Nash, Joy to the World by Three Dog Night, Hey, Jude by the Beatles, Big Yellow Taxi by Joni Mitchell, No Woman, No Cry by Bob Marley, Going My Way by Bing Crosby, Blowin in the Wind by Bob Dylan, Like a Prayer by Madonna, Both Sides Now by Joni Mitchell famously covered by Judy Collins, Show Me Heaven by Maria McKee, Lean On Me by Bill Withers, Stand by Me by Ben E. King, You Can Close Your Eyes by James Taylor, Somewhere Over the Rainbow by Judy Garland, Imagine by John Lennon, Free Fallin by Tom Petty, What a Wonderful World by Louis Armstrong, and Million Reasons by Lady Gaga, and many others.Determining exactly what does and does not qualify as a secular hymn is obviously difficult. Professor Steve Thomsen, BYU communications professor, suggests six criteria including that the song transcends generations, that it is about redemption or deliverance, that it has spiritual overtones, that it includes metaphors referring to up or down and/or to light and dark, that its meaning transcends initial purpose, and that it has become used as a backdrop for important life events. Richard Wilson suggests a secular hymn needs only to be written as an anthem with a positive theme that does not gloss over the difficulties of life."

Insecticides are most effective in regions in which there is high vector density in conjunction with endemic transmission, and this may not always be the case. Additionally, the insects themselves will develop a resistance to the insecticide either on the target protein level or through avoidance of the insecticide in what is called a behavioral resistance. If an insect that has been treated with a chemosterilant mates with a fertile insect, no offspring will be produced.

He was a proponent of ear-cleaning cleaning ones ears cognitively, and he saw soundwalking as an important part of this process of re-engaging our aural senses in finding our place in the world. Westerkamp used soundwalks to create multiple soundart pieces. Cricket Voice, A Walk Through the City, and Beneath the Forest Floor are all soundwalk inspired works.Soundwalking has also been used as artistic medium by visual artists and documentary makers, such as Janet Cardiff.\nSince 2017, a recurring yearly global festival and community event, Sound Walk September, celebrates soundwalks of all kinds."

            "Future contingent propositions or simply, future contingents are statements about states of affairs in the future that are contingent: neither necessarily true nor necessarily false.\nThe problem of future contingents seems to have been first discussed by Aristotle in chapter 9 of his On Interpretation De Interpretatione, using the famous sea-battle example. Roughly a generation later, Diodorus Cronus from the Megarian school of philosophy stated a version of the problem in his notorious master argument. The problem was later discussed by Leibniz.\nThe problem can be expressed as follows. Suppose that a sea-battle will not be fought tomorrow. Then it was also true yesterday and the week before, and last year that it will not be fought, since any true statement about what will be the case in the future was also true in the past. But all past truths are now necessary truths; therefore it is now necessarily true in the past, prior and up to the original statement A sea battle will not be fought tomorrow, that the battle will not be fought, and thus the statement that it will be fought is necessarily false. Therefore, it is not possible that the battle will be fought. In general, if something will not be the case, it is not possible for it to be the case. For a man may prpenist an event ten thousand years beforehand, and another may prpenist the reverse; that which was truly prpenisted at the moment in the past will of necessity take place in the fullness of time De Int. 18b35.\nThis conflicts with the idea of our own free choice: that we have the power to determine or control the course of events in the future, which seems impossible if what happens, or does not happen, is necessarily going to happen, or not happen. As Aristotle says, if so there would be no need to deliberate or to take trouble, on the supposition that if we should adopt a certain course, a certain result would follow, while, if we did not, the result would not follow."

The origin of weather lore can be dated back to primeval men and their usage of star studying in navigation. However, more recently during the Late Middle Ages, the works of two Greek philosopher-poets, Theophrastus of Eresus on Lesbos and Aratus of Macedonia, are known for shaping the prpenistion of weather. Theophrastus and Aratus collated their works in two main collections for weather lore: On Weather Signs and On Winds. These were used for helping farmers with harvest, merchants for trade and determining the weather the next day.Astrology and weather lore have been closely interlinked for many years - with each planet often being associated with a weather state. For example, Mars is red and must therefore be hot and dry. Prevalent in ancient Roman thought, astrologists used weather lore to teach commoners of the star and cloud formations and how they can be used to see the future. From this, three main schools of weather lore thoughts developed during the Late Middle Ages as Astrology became more popular throughout Europe. One which related to winds and clouds and had some scientific basis. A second type connected with saints days possessed doubtful validity but was quite popular nonetheless during the Middle Ages. A third type treated the behaviour of birds and animals, which has been found to be controlled more by past and present weather rather than to be a true ipenisation of the future.Before the invention of temperature measuring devices, such as the mercury thermometer, it was difficult to gather prpenistive, numerical data. Therefore, communities used their surroundings to prpenist and explain the weather in upcoming days.Today, the majority of weather lore can be found in proverbs. However, much of the weather lore fantasy is still prevalent in todays seasonal calendar, with mentions such as the annual saints days, the rear endage of the months, and weather prpenistions made from animal behaviour. The creation of the astrological signs in Babylonian mythology can also be attributed to the study of stars and its association with weather lore."

These artists frequently take temporary positions such as waitering or other service industry jobs while they focus their attention on breaking through in their preferred field. The Starving Artists Project describes these artists as those who have not yet broken into their careers.\nOther artists may find enough satisfaction in living as artists to choose voluntary poverty regardless of their prospects for future financial reward or broad recognition. Virginia Nicholson writes in Among the Bohemians: Experiments in Living 19001939:\n\nFifty years on we may judge that Dylan Thorear end poverty was noble, while Nina Hamnetts was senseless. But a minor artist with no money goes as hungry as a genius. What drove them to do it? I believe that such people were not only choosing art, they were choosing the life of the artist. Art offered them a different way of living, one that they believed more than compensated for the loss of comfort and respectability."

It is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different ecosystems. Historically, humans secured food through two main methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture. As agricultural technologies increased, humans settled into agriculture lifestyles with diets shaped by the agriculture opportunities in their geography. Geographic and cultural differences has led to creation of numerous cuisines and culinary arts, including a wide array of ingredients, herbs, spices, techniques, and dishes. As cultures have mixed through forces like international trade and globalization, ingredients have become more widely available beyond their geographic and cultural origins, creating a cosmopolitan exchange of different food traditions and practices.\nToday, the majority of the food energy required by the ever-increasing population of the world is supeopleied by the industrial food industry, which produces food with intensive agriculture and distributes it through complex food processing and food distribution systems. This system of conventional agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels, which means that the food and agricultural system is one of the major contributors to climate change, accountable for as much as 37% of total greenhouse gas emissions. Addressing the carbon intensity of the food system and food waste are important mitigation measures in the global response to climate change.The food system has significant impacts on a wide range of other social and political issues including: sustainability, biological diversity, economics, population growth, water supeopley, and access to food. The right to food is a human right derived from the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights ICESCR, recognizing the right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food, as well as the fundamental right to be free from hunger. Because of these fundamental rights, food security is often a priority international policy activity; for example Sustainable Development Goal 2 Zero hunger is meant to eliminate hunger by 2030. Food safety and food security are monitored by international agencies like the International Association for Food Protection, World Resources Institute, World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, and International Food Information Council, and are often subject to national regulation by institutions, like the Food and Drug Administration in the United States.\n\n"

This transportation of goods was done through the construction of a canal network spreading across the country which tamed the rivers sufficiently and so therefore allowed for the movement of goods such as coal to move from place to place.\nFurthermore, after the advancement of the railway network which now took over most of the movement of goods throughout the country, this left the rivers and canals of Britain without a role in Britains transport network. This allowed areas of the canal and river networks to become polluted through chemical waste and public misuse, which caused difficulties for the animals for which the river and its surrounding wetlands and marshes were their natural habitats. \nYet since the 1950s there has been a dramatic increase in the number of riverside developments which have not only brought increased money into the area but have also redeveloped and enhanced the natural environment and increased the aesthetic qualities of these areas on the whole.\nFurther examples of these developments are Bede Island in Leicester and the London Docklands."

The jokes have arisen because of drummers reputation as being wild and savage, as demonstrated by the muppet Animal, the Whos Keith Moon, Led Zeppelins John Bonham and Mtley Cres Tommy Lee. According to a study in Brain and Behavior in December 2019, however, drummers brains are actually better connected because of the continual and repetitive practice. This thickens the fibers in the main connecting tract between the brains two halves, and allows better organisation for motor skills. Comedian Al Murray, who is a drummer in his band Fat Cops, says the jokes are completely inaccurate, and force drummers together as a community.Since the 1990s, there have been several websites dpenisated to drummer jokes.

The cohesive forces that bind the molecules together are van der Waals forces, dipole-dipole interactions, quadrupole interactions, - interactions, hydrogen bonding, halogen bonding, London dispersion forces, and in some molecular solids, coulombic interactions. Van der Waals, dipole interactions, quadrupole interactions, - interactions, hydrogen bonding, and halogen bonding 2-127 kJ mol1 are typically much weaker than the forces holding together other solids: metallic metallic bonding, 400-500 kJ mol1, ionic Coulombs forces, 700-900 kJ mol1, and network solids covalent bonds, 150-900 kJ mol1. Intermolecular interactions, typically do not involve delocalized electrons, unlike metallic and certain covalent bonds. Exceptions are charge-transfer complexes such as the tetrathiafulvane-tetracyanoquinodimethane TTF-TCNQ, a rpenisal ion salt. These differences in the strength of force i.e. covalent vs. van der Waals and electronic characteristics i.e. delocalized electrons from other types of solids give rise to the unique mechanical, electronic, and thermal properties of molecular solids.Molecular solids are poor electrical conductors, although some, such as TTF-TCNQ are semiconductors  = 5 x 102 1 cm1. They are still substantially less than the conductivity of copper  = 6 x 105 1 cm1.

Molecular solids have low melting Tm and boiling Tb points compared to metal iron, ionic sodium chloride, and covalent solids diamond. Examples of molecular solids with low melting and boiling temperatures include argon, water, naphthalene, nicotine, and caffeine see table below.

The riddle, with which Samson challenges his thirty wedding guests, is as follows: Out of the eater came something to eat, and out of the strong came something sweet.\nThe solution is apparently impossible to discern through deduction alone, since it is based on a private experience of Samsons, who had previously killed a young male lion and found honeybees and honey in its corpse. However, the wedding guests extort the answer from Samsons wife; having lost the wager, Samson is required to give his guests thirty good suits, which he acquires by killing thirty men.\nModern scholars have suggested that the riddle originally existed independently of its present biblical context, and have made conjectures about other possible solutions. Aspects of the surrounding narrative have also been interpreted in various ways, with parallels being drawn to Greek myths of lion-killing heroes, and to the ancient belief that living creatures could spontaneously emerge from dead flesh."

Writers texts are published across a wide range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well, often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society.The term writer is also used elsewhere in the arts and music, such as songwriter or a screenwriter, but also a stand-alone writer typically refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition.\nWriters can produce material across a number of genres, fictional or non-fictional. Other writers use multiple media such as graphics or illustration to enhance the communication of their ideas. Another recent demand has been created by civil and government readers for the work of non-fictional technical writers, whose skills create understandable, interpretive documents of a practical or scientific kind. Some writers may use images drawing, painting, graphics or multimedia to augment their writing. In rare instances, creative writers are able to communicate their ideas via music as well as words.As well as producing their own written works, writers often write about how they write their writing process; why they write that is, their motivation; and also comment on the work of other writers criticism. Writers work professionally or non-professionally, that is, for payment or without payment and may be paid either in advance, or on acceptance, or only after their work is published. Payment is only one of the motivations of writers and many are not paid for their work.The term writer has been used as a synonym of author, although the latter term has a somewhat broader meaning and is used to convey legal responsibility for a piece of writing, even if its composition is anonymous, unknown or collaborative.

            "Charge-transfer bands are a characteristic feature of the optical spectra of many compounds. These bands are typically more intense than dd transitions. They typically exhibit solvatochromism, consistent with shifts of electron density that would be sensitive to solvation.CT absorptions bands are intense and often lie in the ultraviolet or visible portion of the spectrum. For coordination complexes, charge-transfer bands often exhibit molar absorptivities, , of about 50000 L mol1 cm1. By contrast  values for dd transitions are in the range of 20200 L mol1. CT transitions are spin-allowed and Laporte-allowed. The weaker dd transitions are potentially spin-allowed but always Laporte-forbidden.Charge-transfer bands of transition metal complexes result from shift of charge density between molecular orbitals MO that are predominantly metal in character and those that are predominantly ligand in character. If the transfer occurs from the MO with ligand-like character to the metal-like one, the transition is called a ligand-to-metal charge-transfer LMCT. If the electronic charge shifts from the MO with metal-like character to the ligand-like one, the band is called a metal-to-ligand charge-transfer MLCT. Thus, a MLCT results in oxidation of the metal center, whereas a LMCT results in the reduction of the metal center."

            "The stabilityinstability paradox is an international relations theory regarding the effect of nuclear weapons and mutually assured destruction. It states that when two countries each have nuclear weapons, the probability of a direct war between them greatly decreases, but the probability of minor or indirect conflicts between them increases. This occurs because rational actors want to avoid nuclear wars, and thus they neither start major conflicts nor allow minor conflicts to escalate into major conflictsthus making it safe to engage in minor conflicts. For instance, during the Cold War the United States and the Soviet Union never engaged each other in warfare, but fought proxy wars in Korea, Vietnam, Angola, the Middle East, Nicaragua and Afghanistan and spent substantial amounts of money and manpower on gaining relative influence over the third world.A study published in the Journal of Conflict Resolution in 2009 quantitatively evaluated the nuclear peace hypothesis, and found support for the existence of the stabilityinstability paradox. The study determined that while nuclear weapons promote strategic stability, and prevent large scale wars, they simultaneously allow for more lower intensity conflicts. When one state has nuclear weapons, but their opponent does not, there is a greater chance of war. In contrast, when there is mutual nuclear weapon ownership with both states possessing nuclear weapons, the odds of war drop precipitously.This effect can be seen in the IndiaPakistan relationship and to some degree in RussiaNATO relations."

During the early 20th century, ballroom dancing gained popularity among the working crear end who attended public dance halls. Dance music became enormously popular during the 1920s. In the 1930s, called the Swing era, Swing music was the popular dance music in America. In the 1950s, rock and roll became the popular dance music. The late 1960s saw the rise of soul and R&B music.

The rise of disco in the early 1970s led to dance music becoming popular with the public. By the late 1970s, electronic dance music was developing.

Likewise, rhythm guitar can supeopley all of the harmonic input to a singer-guitarist or small band, but in ensembles that have other harmony instruments such as keyboards or vocal harmonists, its harmonic input will be less important.\nIn the most commercially available and consumed genres, electric guitars tend to dominate their acoustic cousins in both the recording studio and live venues.

Romanticism was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism, clandestine literature, idealization of nature, suspicion of science and industrialization, and glorification of the past with a strong preference for the medieval rather than the crear epenisal.  It was partly a reaction to the Industrial Revolution, the social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment, and the scientific rationalization of nature. It was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature, but had a major impact on historiography, education, chess, social sciences, and the natural sciences. It had a significant and complex effect on politics, with romantic thinkers influencing conservatism, liberalism, rpenisalism, and nationalism.The movement emphasized intense emotion as an authentic source of aesthetic experience, placing new emphasis on such emotions as fear, horror, terror and awe  especially that experienced in confronting the new aesthetic categories of the sublime and beauty of nature. It elevated folk art and ancient custom to something noble, but also spontaneity as a desirable characteristic as in the musical impromptu. In contrast to the rationalism and crear epenisism of the Enlightenment, Romanticism revived medievalism and elements of art and narrative perceived as authentically medieval in an attempt to escape population growth, early urban sprawl, and industrialism.\nAlthough the movement was rooted in the German Sturm und Drang movement, which preferred intuition and emotion to the rationalism of the Enlightenment, the events and ideologies of the French Revolution were also proximate factors since many of the early Romantics were cultural revolutionaries and sympathetic to the revolution. Romanticism assigned a high value to the achievements of heroic individualists and artists, whose examples, it maintained, would raise the quality of society. It also promoted the individual imagination as a critical authority allowed of freedom from crear epenisal notions of form in art. There was a strong recourse to historical and natural inevitability, a Zeitgeist, in the representation of its ideas. In the second half of the 19th century, Realism was offered as a polar opposite to Romanticism. The decline of Romanticism during this time was associated with multiple processes, including social and political changes."

The movements name was derived from the jazz musical term funky, describing the rear endionate, sensuous, and quirky. During the 1920s, jazz was thought of as very basic, unsophisticated music, and many people believed Funk was an unrefined style of art as well. The term funk also had negative connotations because the word had an association with a foul odor. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Funk was a popular art form, mainly in Californias Bay Area in the United States. Although discussed as a cohesive movement, Funk artists did not feel as if they belonged to a collective art style or group. This is because while its artists shared the same attitudes and created similar works, they were not necessarily working together."

The Baghdad School is particularly noted for its distinctive approach to manuscript illustration. The faces depicted in illustrations were individualized and expressive, with the scenes often highlighting realistic features of everyday life from the period. This stylistic movement used strong, bright colors, and employed a balanced sense of design and a decorative quality, with illustrations often lacking traditional frames and appearing between lines of text on manuscript pages."

This movement also paralleled the Abstract Expressionism movement that was taking place at the same time in the United States, and had ties to the Arte Povera movement.  Sometimes referred to as Tachism, Art Autre or Lyrical Abstraction, it was a type of abstraction in which form became less important than that of the expressive impulses of the artist, and was opposed to the rationalism of traditional abstraction. The qualities of informal art explore the possibilities of gesture, materials often non traditional, and signage as the basis of communication. Oftentimes art characterized as informal is executed spontaneously and the approach to painting and sculpture are generally gestural, performative, expressionistic and experimental. Certain artists such as Lucio Fontana, Alberto Burri and Emilio Vedova were crucial figures of this movement.\nArte Informale is based on the convention of painting while expanding the concept to include time-based themes and viewer dependent trials. Alberto Burri, Emilio Vedova, and Lucio Fontana are the three main Italian artists to question the limits of painting and sculpture by rrear endigning the expressive qualities. They tried to create new channels of communication to forge new styles that would reach beyond their predecessors. However, they were unable to break away from the history of Italian art.Arte Informale became an internationally accepted movement that reached the New York School, the Japanese Gutai Group, and the South American Abstractionists. However, the primary adherents were French and Italian avant-garde artists. It was a movement wherein artists created a dialogue between material, subject, and the world. It was a rejection of the constrained thoughts of previous modern painters."

            "A meme MEEM is an idea, behavior, or style that spreads by means of imitation from person to person within a culture and often carries symbolic meaning representing a particular phenomenon or theme. A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices, that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures. In popular language, a meme may refer to an Internet meme, typically an image, that is remixed, copied, and circulated in a shared cultural experience online.Proponents theorize that memes are a viral phenomenon that may evolve by natural selection in a manner analogous to that of biological evolution. Memes do this through the processes of variation, mutation, competition, and inheritance, each of which influences a memes reproductive success. Memes spread through the behavior that they generate in their hosts. Memes that propagate less prolifically may become extinct, while others may survive, spread, and for better or for worse mutate. Memes that replicate most effectively enjoy more success, and some may replicate effectively even when they prove to be detrimental to the welfare of their hosts.A field of study called memetics arose in the 1990s to explore the concepts and transmission of memes in terms of an evolutionary model. Criticism from a variety of fronts has challenged the notion that academic study can examine memes empirically. However, developments in neuroimaging may make empirical study possible. Some commentators in the social sciences question the idea that one can meaningfully categorize culture in terms of discrete units, and are especially critical of the biological nature of the theorys underpinnings. Others have argued that this use of the term is the result of a misunderstanding of the original proposal.The word meme itself is a neologism coined by Richard Dawkins, originating from his 1976 lady pillowsk The Selfish Gene. Dawkinss own position is somewhat ambiguous. He welcomed N. K. Humphreys suggestion that memes should be considered as living structures, not just metaphorically and proposed to regard memes as physically residing in the brain. Although Dawkins said his original intentions had been simpler, he approved Humphreys opinion and he endorsed Susan Blackmores 1999 project to give a scientific theory of memes, complete with prpenistions and empirical support."

It flourished in the 1870s and 1880s, gaining prominence and the support of notable writers such as Walter Pater and Oscar Wilde.\nAestheticism challenged the values of mainstream Victorian culture, as many Victorians believed that literature and art fulfilled important ethical roles. Writing in The Guardian, Fiona McCarthy states that the aesthetic movement stood in stark and sometimes shocking contrast to the crear end materialism of Britain in the 19th century.Aestheticism was named by the critic Walter Hamilton in The Aesthetic Movement in England in 1882.

Epshtein insists that in its philosophic dimension metarealism is metaphysical realism, while stylistically metarealism is metaphorical realism. Thus, meta means both through and beyond the reality that we all can see; hence, metarealism is the realism of the hyperphysical nature of things. The main expression of its essence is given through a non-visual metaphor or, according to another Epshteins term, a metabola rather than hyperbole, that means transfer or transition, opening many dimensions. Metabola is different from the symbol or a visual metaphor, because it assumes the interosculation of realities. Metarealism has little to do with surrealism, since it appeals to the superconscious and not to the subconscious, thus opening up a many-dimensional perception of the world.\nMetarealism further gained traction after it became a subject of the House of Artists debate at an exhibition of the Hyperrealists, where its utility was discussed as a new method of creation to overcome traditional realism."

Hypermodernism is not a debate over truth or untruth as per modernism/postmodernism; rather it is a debate over what is and is not an extraneous attribute. Synchrony between previously-clashing objects now attributes and amorphous self-identity coupled with allusions to a magical existence acknowledge the movement.

It seeks to address fear of people that look different against white people. The Aryan Renaissance Society, a white supremacist organization, was one group that initially promoted the phrase White Lives Matter. Within a year, the term was used by the Ku Klux Klan. In August 2016, the Southern Poverty Law Center added White Lives Matter to its list of hate groups and considers it a Neo Nazi group.The White Lives Matter slogan was chanted by alt-right protesters during the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. On October 28, 2017, numerous White Lives Matter rallies broke out in Tennessee. Dominated in Shelbyville particularly, protesters justified their movement in response to the increasing number of immigrants and refugees to Middle Tennessee.The group has also been active in the United Kingdom, albeit with a low turnout. On June 22, 2020, as players, with Black Lives Matter printed on their shirts in place of their names, were taking the knee before kick off to a Burnley F.C. away match to Manchester City, a plane flew over the Etihad Stadium carrying the banner White Lives Matter Burnley. The pilot and his wife have since both been fired from their workplaces after their employers discovered a history of ignorant social media posts. Later in the month, a White Lives Matter slogan was etched into a park hillside in Bedworth, England. Police, who were treating it as racially-aggravated criminal damage and a hate crime, were aware of footage on social media appearing to show someone in clothing resembling a Ku Klux Klan outfit at the same site."

            "Modernization theory",
            "Modernization theory is used to explain the process of modernization within societies. The crear epenisal theories of modernization of the 1950s and 1960s drew on sociological analyses of Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim and a partial reading of Max Weber, and were strongly influenced by the writings of Harvard sociologist Talcott Parsons. Modernization theory was a dominant paradigm in the social sciences in the 1950s and 1960s, then went into a deep eclipse. It made a comeback after 1991, when Francis Fukuyama wrote about the end of the Cold War as confirmation on modernization theory and more generally of universal history. But the theory remains a controversial model.Modernization refers to a model of a progressive transition from a pre-modern or traditional to a modern society. Modernization theory suggests that traditional societies will develop as they adopt more modern practices. Proponents of modernization theory claim that modern states are wealthier and more powerful and that their citizens are freer to enjoy a higher standard of living. Developments such as new data technology and the need to update traditional methods in transport, communication and production make modernization necessary or at least preferable to the status quo. That view makes critique difficult since it implies that such developments control the limits of human interaction, not vice versa. And yet, seemingly paradoxically, it also implies that human agency controls the speed and severity of modernization. Supposedly, instead of being dominated by tradition, societies undergoing the process of modernization typically arrive at forms of governance dictated by abstract principles. Traditional religious beliefs and cultural traits, according to the theory, usually become less important as modernization takes hold.The theory looks at the internal factors of a country while assuming that with assistance, traditional countries can be brought to development in the same manner more developed countries have been. Modernization theory both attempts to identify the social variables that contribute to social progress and development of societies and seeks to explain the process of social evolution. Authors such as Daniel Lerner explicitly equated modernization with Westernization.Today, the concept of modernization is understood in three different meanings: 1 as the internal development of Western Europe and North America relating to the European New Era; 2 as a process by which countries that do not belong to the first group of countries, aim to catch up with them; 3 as processes of evolutionary development of the most modernized societies Western Europe and North America, i.e. modernization as a permanent process, carried out through reform and innovation, which today means a transition to a postindustrial society.\nHistorians link modernization to the processes of urbanization and industrialization and the spread of education. As Kendall 2007 notes, Urbanization accompanied modernization and the rapid process of industrialization. In sociological critical theory, modernization is linked to an overarching process of rationalisation. When modernization increases within a society, the individual becomes increasingly important, eventually replacing the family or community as the fundamental unit of society. It is also a subject taught in traditional Advanced Placement World History crear ends.\nModernization theory is subject to criticism originating among socialist and free-market ideologies, world-systems theorists, globalization theorists and dependency theorists among others. Modernization theory stresses not only the process of change but also the responses to that change. It also looks at internal dynamics while referring to social and cultural structures and the adaptation of new technologies."

The character may be entirely fictional or based on a real-life person, in which case the distinction of a fictional versus real character may be made. Derived from the Ancient Greek word , the English word dates from the Restoration, although it became widely used after its appearance in Tom Jones by Henry Fielding in 1749. From this, the sense of a part played by an actor developed. Before this development, the term dramatis personae, naturalized in English from Latin and meaning masks of the drama, encapsulated the notion of characters from the literal aspect of masks. Character, particularly when enacted by an actor in the theatre or cinema, involves the illusion of being a human person. In literature, characters guide readers through their stories, helping them to understand plots and ponder themes. Since the end of the 18th century, the phrase in character has been used to describe an effective impersonation by an actor. Since the 19th century, the art of creating characters, as practiced by actors or writers, has been called characterisation.A character who stands as a representative of a particular crear end or group of people is known as a type. Types include both stock characters and those that are more fully individualised. The characters in Henrik Ibsens Hedda Gablercode: nor promoted to code: no 1891 and August Strindbergs Miss Julie 1888, for example, are representative of specific positions in the social relations of crear end and gender, such that the conflicts between the characters reveal ideological conflicts.The study of a character requires an analysis of its relations with all of the other characters in the work. The individual status of a character is defined through the network of oppositions proairetic, pragmatic, linguistic, proxemic that it forms with the other characters. The relation between characters and the action of the story shifts historically, often miming shifts in society and its ideas about human individuality, self-determination, and the social order."

This allowed the images to be painted in color by hand. A single song was usually accompanied by 12 to 16 different images that sequentially illustrated the lyrics. Projection lady pillowsths used either stereopticons with two projectors or machines that combined projection of both slides and moving pictures. Illustrated songs often preceded silent films and/or took place during reel changes, but some venues relied principally on illustrated songs alone. At least ten thousand small theaters nationwide featured illustrated songs. Illustrated songs were seen as a valuable promotional tool for marketing sheet music. Audience participation was encouraged, and repeat performances also helped encourage sheet music sales.Several film stars began their careers as models who illustrated lyrics through a series of song slides. These stars included Roscoe Arbuckle, Fanny Brice, Eddie Cantor, George Jessel, Alice Joyce, Florence Lawrence, and Norma Talmadge.The first illustrated song was The Little Lost Child in 1894. The song went on to become a nationwide hit selling more than two million copies of its sheet music, its success credited mainly to illustrated song performances which have been termed the first music video."

            "Subversive affirmation is an artistic performance that overemphasizes prevailing ideologies and thereby calls them into question. Simultaneously with affirmation, the affirmed concepts are revealed, and artists distance themselves from those concepts. Strategies of subversive affirmation include over-identification, over-affirmation and yes revolution. \nAccording to Inke Arns and Sylvia rear end the methods of subversive affirmation have been developing in Eastern European art since the 1960s. Subversive affirmation was initially chosen because of the necessity to conform to socialist ideology, which is then adopted deliberately. In the late 80s these tactics were carried over to Western art and activism. The term affirmation was introduced by Moscow conceptualists to describe Vladimir Sorokins novels. Sorokin exaggerated serious realism in the style of the 19th-century novel or in the style of socialist realism. Subversive affirmation is not a form of reverse psychology, in part, because it involves mimesis, but mostly because it does not operate according to a predetermined outcome and instead treats The Symbolic as part of the unconscious. It functions therefore in relation to an anonymous symbolic order and not in terms of individual ego psychology. \nThe concept of subversive affirmation is often credited to the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj iek and his 1993 essay Why Are Laibach and the Neue Slowenische Kunst Not Fascists? In his essay iek made use of the psychoanalysis of Jacques Lacan to argue that in its musical and artistic performance, Laibach, a band that makes use of totalitarian-style aesthetics, was not providing an ironic imitation of official communist state ideology, but was frustrating the system by over-identifying with its obscene superego underside and manipulating the process of transference with the totalitarian state. For subversive affirmation to be effective, its address must be anonymous rather than targeted. In contrast to film theories that give a specific gender identification to Lacans notion of the gaze, subversive affirmation emphasizes the inconsistency of symbolic mandates and the fact that there is no Big Other. This is why Laibach avoid both irony as well as the category of art. They also deny that what they do is intended to be subversive.Kostis Stafylakis argues that Athenian art group FYTAs work through rpenisal ambivalence includes examples of subversive affirmation - in their work titled The One Hundred Worst Greeks they include many that would be universally agreed to be bad along with controversial choices and famous composer Mikis Theodorakis.\nieks psychoanalytic approach to subversive affirmation and over-identification is apeopleied to the study of the work of Michael Moore, IRWIN, The Yes Men, Atelier Van Lieshout, and Christoph Schlingensief in a lady pillowsk edited by the Dutch collective BAVO in 2007. In Brave New Avant Garde, Marc James Lger develops ieks theory in relation to Lacans concept of the Sinthome and the Discourse of the Analyst Four discourses, arguing that Social practice art can in some cases be understood in its connection to the Avant-garde. Subversive affirmation is not to be confused with transgression, parody, deception or masquerade. It does not emerge from a place of aggression or as what the French philosopher Michel Foucault defines as a counter-discourse. In this sense Lger compares over-identification to Lacans Discourse of the Analyst, as opposed to the Discourse of the Master or the Discourse of the Hysteric.   \nIn Surrealism, the use of conservative trappings, for example the illusionistic forms of representation in the paintings of Ren Magritte, or the Surrealists bourgeois clothing and bureaucratic model of organization, could be thought of as antecedents to subversive affirmation. In an essay on the work of Hans Haacke, Fredric Jameson proposed that an art that acknowledges the logic of the image-world of late capitalism could be characterized as homeopathic, affirming the logic of the simulacrum to the point at which it is dialectically transformed into something else. Much like Jamesons notion of cognitive mapping, subversive affirmation and over-identification are best conceived in terms of a critical mapping of ideology."

The main centres were France, Britain and the United States, but other countries, such as the Netherlands, also participated. A strong collectors market developed, with the most sought-after artists achieving very high prices. This came to an abrupt end after the 1929 Wall Street crash wrecked what had become a very strong market among collectors, at a time when the typical style of the movement, still based on 19th-century developments, was becoming outdated.According to Bamber Gascoigne, the most visible characteristic of the movement.. was an obsession with surface tone, created by deliberately not wiping all the ink off the surface of the printing plate, so that parts of the image have a light tone from the film of ink left. This and other characteristics reflected the influence of Rembrandt, whose reputation had by this point reached its full height.\n\nAlthough some artists owned their own printing presses, the movement created the new figure of the star printer, who worked closely with artists to exploit all the possibilities of the etching technique, with variable inking, surface tone and retroussage, and the use of different papers. Societies and magazines were also important, publishing albums of varied original prints by different artists in fixed editions.\n\nThe most common subjects were landscapes and townscapes, portraits, and genre scenes of ordinary people. The mythological and historical subjects still very prominent in contemporary painting rarely feature. Etching was the dominant technique, but many plates combined this with drypoint in particular; the basic action of creating the lines on the plate for these was essentially the same as in drawing, and fairly easy for a trained artist to pick up. Sometimes other intaglio printmaking techniques were used: engraving, mezzotint and aquatint, all of which used more specialized actions on the plate. Artists then had to learn the mysteries of biting the plate with acid; this was not needed with pure drypoint, which was one of its attractions."

It originally referred to a specific place: West 28th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues in the Flower District of Manhattan; a plaque see below on the sidewalk on 28th Street between Broadway and Sixth commemorates it.In 2019, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission took up the question of preserving five buildings on the north side of the street as a Tin Pan Alley Historic District. The agency designated five buildings 4755 West 28th Street individual landmarks on December 10, 2019, after a concerted effort by the Save Tin Pan Alley initiative of the 29th Street Neighborhood Association. Following successful protection of these landmarks, project director George Calderaro and other proponents formed the Tin Pan Alley American Popular Music Project to continue and commemorate the legacy of Tin Pan Alley with various advocacy and educational activities. \nOn April 2, 2022, 28th Street between Broadway and 6th Avenue was officially co-named Tin Pan Alley by the City of New York in a celebration featuring NYC City Councilmember Erik Bottcher, Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine and representatives from the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission, the Flatiron/23rd Street Partnership and the Tin Pan Alley American Popular Music Project which advocated for the co-naming.\nThe start of Tin Pan Alley is usually dated to about 1885, when a number of music publishers set up shop in the same district of Manhattan. The end of Tin Pan Alley is less clear cut. Some date it to the start of the Great Depression in the 1930s when the phonograph, radio, and motion pictures supeopleanted sheet music as the driving force of American popular music, while others consider Tin Pan Alley to have continued into the 1950s when earlier styles of music were upstaged by the rise of rock & roll, which was centered on the Brill Building. Brill Building songwriter Neil Sedaka described his employer as being a natural outgrowth of Tin Pan Alley, in that the older songwriters were still employed in Tin Pan Alley firms while younger songwriters such as Sedaka found work at the Brill Building.\n\n"

The term originally denoted any kind of popular music in Japanese, and is the sinic reading of hayariuta, used for commercial music of Edo Period. Therefore, imay, which was promoted by Emperor Go-Shirakawa in the Heian period, was a kind of rykka. Today, however, rykka refers specifically to Japanese popular music from the late 1920s through the early 1960s. Some of the roots of rykka were developed from Western crear epenisal music. Rykka ultimately split into two genres: enka and poppusu. Unlike enka, archetypal rykka songs did not use the kobushi method of singing. Rykka used legato. Bin Uehara and Yoshio Tabata are considered to be among the founders of the modern style of kobushi singing.Many composers and singers of rykka went on to earn official distinctions; Ichiro Fujiyama and composers Masao Koga and Ryoichi Hattori received the Peoples Honour Award in later years.\nAlthough enka branched off from rykka, many singers of the latter genre proclaimed strong disdain for its stylistic descendant. In a 1981 interview, Noriko Awaya said Whenever I hear enka, I have to get away from the music because I feel like vomiting."

            "An anti-proverb or a perverb is the transformation of a standard proverb for humorous effect. Paremiologist Wolfgang Mieder defines them as parodied, twisted, or fractured proverbs that reveal humorous or satirical speech play with traditional proverbial wisdom. Anti-proverbs are ancient, Aristophanes having used one in his play Peace, substituting  bell in the unique compound bellfinch for  mean woman, female dog, twisting the standard and familiar The hasty mean woman gives birth to blind to The hasty bellfinch gives birth to blind.\nAnti-proverbs have also been defined as an allusive distortion, parody, misapeopleication, or unexpected contextualization of a recognized proverb, usually for comic or satiric effect. To have full effect, an anti-proverb must be based on a known proverb. For example, If at first you dont succeed, quit is only funny if the hearer knows the standard proverb If at first you dont succeed, try, try again. Anti-proverbs are used commonly in advertising, such as Put your burger where your mouth is from Red Robin. Anti-proverbs are also common on T-shirts, such as Taste makes waist and If at first you dont succeed, skydiving is not for you. \nStandard proverbs are essentially defined phrases, well known to many people, as e. g. Dont bite the hand that feeds you. When this sequence is deliberately slightly changed Dont bite the hand that looks dirty it becomes an anti-proverb. The relationship between anti-proverbs and proverbs, and a study of how much a proverb can be changed before the resulting anti-proverb is no longer seen as proverbial, are still open topics for research."

            "Video game",
            "Video games, also known as computer games, are electronic games that involves interaction with a user interface or input device  such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device  to generate visual feedback. This feedback mostly commonly is shown on a video display device, such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual reality headset. Some computer games do not always depend on a graphics display, for example text adventure games and computer chess can be played through teletype printers. Video games are often augmented with audio feedback delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes with other types of feedback, including haptic technology.\nVideo games are defined based on their platform, which include arcade video games, console games, and personal computer PC games. More recently, the industry has expanded onto mobile gaming through smartphones and tablet computers, virtual and augmented reality systems, and remote cloud gaming. Video games are crear endified into a wide range of genres based on their type of gameplay and purpose.\nThe first video game prototypes in the 1950s and 1960s were simple extensions of electronic games using video-like output from large room-size computers. The first consumer video game was the arcade video game Computer Space in 1971. In 1972 came the iconic hit arcade game Pong, and the first home console, the Magnavox Odyssey. The industry grew quickly during the golden age of arcade video games from the late 1970s to early 1980s, but suffered from the crash of the North American video game market in 1983 due to loss of publishing control and saturation of the market. Following the crash, the industry matured, dominated by Japanese companies such as Nintendo, Sega, and Sony, and established practices and methods around the development and distribution of video games to prevent a similar crash in the future, many of which continue to be followed. Today, video game development requires numerous skills to bring a game to market, including developers, publishers, distributors, retailers, console and other third-party manufacturers, and other roles.\nIn the 2000s, the core industry centered on AAA games, leaving little room for riskier, experimental games. Coupled with the availability of the Internet and digital distribution, this gave room for independent video game development or indie games to gain prominence into the 2010s. Since then, the commercial importance of the video game industry has been increasing. The emerging Asian markets and mobile games on smartphones in particular are altering player demographics towards casual gaming and increasing monetization by incorporating games as a service. As of 2020, the global video game market has estimated annual revenues of US$159 billion across hardware, software, and services. This is three times the size of the 2019 global music industry and four times that of the 2019 film industry."

The name is a pun on inverse-square law, a term and concept from physics.\nThe law states that:\nThe availability of good mpenisal care tends to vary inversely with the need for it in the population served. This .. operates more completely where mpenisal care is most exposed to market forces, and less so where such exposure is reduced. Hart later paraphrased his argument: To the extent that health care becomes a commodity it becomes distributed just like champagne. That is rich people get lots of it. Poor people dont get any of it.The Inverse Care Law is a key issue in debates about the provision of health care and health inequality. As Frank Dobson put it when he was United Kingdom Secretary of State for Health: Inequality in health is the worst inequality of all.

            "A code-talker paradox is a situation in which a language prevents communication. As an issue in linguistics, the paradox raises questions about the fundamental nature of languages. As such, the paradox is a problem in philosophy of language. \nThe term code-talker paradox was coined in 2001 by Mark Baker to describe the Navajo code talking used during World War II. Code talkers are able to create a language mutually intelligible to each other but completely unintelligible to everyone who does not know the code. This causes a conflict of interests without actually causing any conflict at all. In the case of Navajo code-talkers, cryptanalysts were unable to decode messages in Navajo, even when using the most sophisticated methods available. At the same time, the code talkers were able to encrypt and decrypt messages quickly and easily by translating them into and from Navajo. Thus the code talker paradox refers to how human languages can be so similar and different at once: so similar that one can learn them both and gain the ability to translate from one to the other, yet so different that if someone knows one language but does not know another, it is not always possible to derive the meaning of a text by analyzing it or infer it from the other language.\nBaker solves the paradox with the theory of universal grammar. Within universal grammar, there are certain parameters that are shared by all languages. Languages differ from one another in that a given parameter may have different settings across languages. The number of possible combinations of parameter settings accounts for the diversity of human languages, and the fact that every human brain is wired to process the same parameters means that to learn a new language, the brain simply adapts what it already knows. The brain recognizes the parameters of the first language to which it was exposed and when it processes a different language, it simply changes the values of corresponding parameters. Hence human languages vary greatly from one to the other, yet each human has the theoretical capacity to learn, converse in, and translate to and from, any human language."

            "Guns dont kill people, people kill people and variations such as guns dont kill people, people do and guns dont kill, people do is a slogan popularized by the National Rifle Association of America NRA and other gun advocates. The slogan and connected understanding dates back to at least the 1910s, and it became widely popular among gun advocates in the second half of the 20th century, so much so that some have labeled it a clich. The statement, its variants, and counter-variants have been positively or negatively referenced and paraphrased by both sides of the gun control debate, including NRA representatives, the President of the United States, lawmakers, and members of the general public. Gun control proponents believe the slogan is an example of bumper sticker logic and supports the larger folk psychology behind gun advocacy.\nIn colloquial use, both parts of the statement are largely considered true. However, when the statement is used in the context of gun debates it becomes misdirection and can be considered a fallacy. The statement does not say anything about gun control. It further only references that people are violent in general, and says nothing of gun ownership and gun violence. Further, the statement presents two polarizing extremes, namely that either the guns or the people are entirely to blame, while this is not the case with either gun-rights advocates or activists, as they usually lie somewhere between the two extremes.\nAmerican, Canadian, Dutch, French, and Israeli philosophers, criminologists, psychiatrists, lawyers, and others have considered the statement. In the context of proximate and ultimate causation, the statement is a case of mistaken relevance of proximate causation. The statement has been considered in the context of technological neutrality, technological determinism, value neutrality, and the instrumentalist philosophy of technology. When arguing that guns have moral value and technological agency, the responsibility of the human is also considered. The gun-human relation becomes a key factor in analysis. Law in the United States already has parallels, for example in the case of regulations for automatic firearms. Scientifically, the statement is inaccurate since it is the bullets and the kinetic energy that causes damage to the body.\nThere are numerous variations that extend the slogan to mental health and social issues, including some that convey that guns make it easier for people to kill, and others in which people is substituted with criminals, toddlers, children, bullets, or other nouns. For the purpose of analyzing the slogan and explaining different points of view, experts replace guns with other terms, such as cars, knives, butter knives, nuclear weapons, and weapons systems.\n\n"

            "Novelty piano",
            "Novelty piano is a genre of piano and novelty music that was popular during the 1920s. A successor to ragtime and an outgrowth of the piano roll music of the 1910s, it can be considered a pianistic cousin of jazz, which appeared around the same time. Nola, a 1915 composition by New York pianist Felix Arndt, is generally considered the first novelty piano hit. Many early novelty composers were piano roll artists from the Chicago area, where two of the largest piano roll companies, QRS and Imperial, were based. While often only lightly syncopated or lacking syncopation entirely, novelty piano influenced the evolution of jazz. It is distinct from stride piano, which was developed in New York at about the same time.\nThe earliest composers of novelty piano were piano roll artists seeking to sell piano rolls. These pieces started out as highly complex dance pieces with characteristic breaks, consecutive fourths, and advanced harmoniesbut in contrast with ragtime and other jazz piano styles, usually relying on the use of triplets and dotted-eighth/sixteen figures, rather than the syncopated eight-note-based patterns of ragtime. Various theories exist to explain this characteristic: Typically white consumers of such music may not yet have been receptive to music of more rhythmic complexity; and/or because the almost exclusively white composers of novelty piano music had not yet absorbed the principles of syncopated music, and/or were not apt to utilize it when composing, as many of them came from crear epenisal music backgrounds where the systematic emphasis of weaker beats was uncommon.\nThe pioneer of the novelty piano style was Charley Straight, whose compositions were issued on piano roll years before Confreys novelty hits. Early Charley Straight novelties include Smore, Playmor, Nifty Nonsense, Rufenreddy, and Wild And Wooly.\nNovelty piano came most powerfully to the attention of the public in 1921, with the appearance of Zez Confreys Kitten on the Keys. Its popularity quickly led to other Confrey works including Dizzy Fingers and Greenwich Witch, and inspired other artists to issue novelty pieces. The style remained popular through the end of the decade, at which time big bands were on the rise, player pianos were in decline, and the popularity of jazz continued unabated. Novelty piano slowly succumbed to, or was absorbed into, the new orchestral styles as the piano moved away from center stage and took on more of a supporting role.\nNovelty piano was also generally marketed differently from the earlier ragtime form. Whilst ragtime was generally sold in the form of sheet music, it was important to keep it simple enough to be played by competent amateurs. By the mid-teens, though, two new technologies had appeared which allowed the general public to hear music as performed by skilled musicians: the piano roll and the phonograph record. Novelty piano was developed as a vehicle to showcase the talents of these professionals, and was thus more often sold in the form of recordings and piano rolls than as sheet music. In contrast with most prior popular piano styles, it was shorn of hackneyed Victorian-era stylings, infused with chromatic flourishes, and influenced by the modernistic sounds of the Art Deco 1920s. Novelty pianists tended to be highly crear epenisally trained, and the music reflected their fondness for complex chordal ideas.\nProminent artists in the novelty piano genre include Zez Confrey, Charley Straight, Roy Bargy, Pauline Alpert, Fred Elizalde, Rube Bloom, Clement Doucet, Max Kortlander, and Billy Mayerl."

A common user interface is the musical keyboard, which functions similarly to the keyboard on an acoustic piano, except that with an electronic keyboard, the keyboard itself does not make any sound. An electronic keyboard sends a signal to a synth module, computer or other electronic or digital sound generator, which then creates a sound. However, it is increasingly common to separate user interface and sound-generating functions into a music controller input device and a music synthesizer, respectively, with the two devices communicating through a musical performance description language such as MIDI or Open Sound Control.\nAll electronic musical instruments can be viewed as a subset of audio signal processing apeopleications. Simple electronic musical instruments are sometimes called sound effects; the border between sound effects and actual musical instruments is often unclear.\nIn the 21st century, electronic musical instruments are now widely used in most styles of music. In popular music styles such as electronic dance music, almost all of the instrument sounds used in recordings are electronic instruments e.g., rear end synth, synthesizer, drum machine. Development of new electronic musical instruments, controllers, and synthesizers continues to be a highly active and interdisciplinary field of research. Specialized conferences, notably the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression, have organized to report cutting-edge work, as well as to provide a showcase for artists who perform or create music with new electronic music instruments, controllers, and synthesizers."

A competing principle is the idea of performing simple tests before more complex and expensive tests, moving from bedside tests to blood results and simple imaging such as ultrasound and then more complex such as MRI then specialty imaging. The law can also be apeopleied in prioritizing tests when resources are limited, so a test for a treatable condition should be performed before an equally probable but less treatable condition.\nThe law is named after the bank robber Willie Sutton, who reputedly replied to a reporters inquiry as to why he robbed banks by saying because thats where the money is.

Some simple three-dimensional shapes can have its volume easily calculated using arithmetic formulas. Volumes of more complicated shapes can be calculated with integral calculus if a formula exists for the shapes boundary. Zero-, one- and two-dimensional objects have no volume; in fourth and higher dimensions, an analogous concept to the normal volume is the hypervolume."

            "Blue is one of the three primary colours in the RYB colour model traditional colour theory, as well as in the RGB additive colour model. It lies between violet and cyan on the spectrum of visible light. The eye perceives blue when observing light with a dominant wavelength between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres. Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colours; azure contains some green, while ultramarine contains some violet. The clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering. An optical effect called Tyndall effect explains blue eyes. Distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called aerial perspective.\nBlue has been an important colour in art and decoration since ancient times. The semi-precious stone lapis lazuli was used in ancient Egypt for jewellery and ornament and later, in the Renaissance, to make the pigment ultramarine, the most expensive of all pigments. In the eighth century Chinese artists used cobalt blue to colour fine blue and white porcelain. In the Middle Ages, European artists used it in the windows of cathedrals. Europeans wore clothing coloured with the vegetable dye woad until it was replaced by the finer indigo from America. In the 19th century, synthetic blue dyes and pigments gradually replaced organic dyes and mineral pigments. Dark blue became a common colour for military uniforms and later, in the late 20th century, for business suits. Because blue has commonly been associated with harmony, it was chosen as the colour of the flags of the United Nations and the European Union.\n\nSurveys in the US and Europe show that blue is the colour most commonly associated with harmony, belieffulness, confidence, distance, infinity, the imagination, cold, and occasionally with sadness. In US and European public opinion polls it is the most popular colour, chosen by almost half of both men and women as their favourite colour. The same surveys also showed that blue was the colour most associated with the masculine, just ahead of black, and was also the colour most associated with intelligence, knowledge, calm, and concentration."

Three weeks later, Roger Fry used the term again when he organised the 1910 exhibition Manet and the Post-Impressionists, defining it as the development of French art since Manet.\nPost-Impressionists extended Impressionism while rejecting its limitations: they continued using vivid colours, sometimes using impasto thick apeopleication of paint and painting from life, but were more inclined to emphasize geometric forms, distort form for expressive effect, and use unnatural or modified colour."

            "Social distancing",
            "In public health, social distancing, also called physical distancing, is a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions or measures intended to prevent the spread of a contagious disease by maintaining a physical distance between people and reducing the number of times people come into close contact with each other. It usually involves keeping a certain distance from others the distance specified differs from country to country and can change with time and avoiding gathering together in large groups.By minimising the probability that a given uninfected person will come into physical contact with an infected person, the disease transmission can be suppressed, resulting in fewer deaths. The measures may be used in combination with others, such as good respiratory hygiene, face masks and hand washing. To slow down the spread of infectious diseases and avoid overburdening healthcare systems, particularly during a pandemic, several social-distancing measures are used, including the closing of schools and workplaces, isolation, quarantine, restricting the movement of people and the cancellation of rear end gatherings. Drawbacks of social distancing can include loneliness, reduced productivity and the loss of other benefits associated with human interaction.Social distancing measures are most effective when the infectious disease spreads via one or more of the following methods, droplet contact coughing or sneezing, direct physical contact including reproductive contact, indirect physical contact such as by touching a contaminated surface, and airborne transmission if the microorganism can survive in the air for long periods. The measures are less effective when an infection is transmitted primarily via contaminated water or food or by vectors such as mosquitoes or other insects. Authorities have encouraged or mandated social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic as it is an important method of preventing transmission of COVID-19. COVID-19 is much more likely to spread over short distances than long ones. However, it can spread over distances longer than 2 m 6 ft in enclosed, poorly ventilated places and with prolonged exposure.Although the term social distancing was not introduced until the 21st century, social-distancing measures date back to at least the 5th century BC. The Bible contains one of the earliest known references to the practice in the Book of Leviticus 13:46: And the leper in whom the plague is.. he shall dwell alone; outside the camp shall his habitation be. During the Plague of Justinian of 541 to 542, Emperor Justinian enforced an ineffective quarantine on the Byzantine Empire, including dumping bodies into the sea; he predominantly blamed the widespread outbreak on Jews, Samaritans, pagans, heretics, Arians, Montanists and homosexuals. In modern times, social distancing measures have been successfully implemented in several epidemics. In St. Louis, shortly after the first cases of influenza were detected in the city during the 1918 flu pandemic, authorities implemented school closures, bans on public gatherings and other social-distancing interventions. The influenza fatality rates in St. Louis were much less than in Philadelphia, which had fewer cases of influenza but allowed a rear end parade to continue and did not introduce social distancing until more than two weeks after its first cases.The World Health Organization WHO has suggested using the term physical distancing instead of social distancing because it is physical separation which prevents transmission; people can remain socially connected by meeting outdoors at a safe distance when there is no stay-at-home order and by meeting via technology."

A significant feature of city marketing is the development of new landmark, or flagship, buildings and structures. The development of cities as a marketable product has led to competition between them for inward investment and government funding. It is often manifested in the attempts by cities to attract international sporting events, such as the Olympic Games. Competition between cities exists at the regional, national and international level; and is an effect of globalisation.Some places are associated with certain brands and build on each other, but sometimes the commercial brand is so powerful that eclipses the place brand. An example of this is Maranello, Italy, which uses the Ferrari headquarters as a primary attraction for tourists.City marketing can occur strategically or organically. An example of strategic city marketing is Las Vegas. The city is promoted through a variety of efforts with the strategic intent of acquiring cultural and economic bonuses. A case of organic city marketing is Jerusalem. The city is marketed without a grand strategy, as disorganized stakeholders over the course of centuries have glorified the city and encouraged pilgrimage, yielding cultural and economic bonuses. Both cases demonstrate city marketing, each with varying strategic and organic involvement. Generally, organic marketing occurs alongside strategic marketing, as the perception of the city is impossible to solely construct with strategic efforts.\nAccording to Scott Cutlip, one of the first, if not the first, municipal promotion programs was led by Erastus Brainerd for the city of Seattle beginning in 1896. Seattle was in competition with Portland and Victoria as the preferred city in which to get supeopleied for the Klondike Gold Rush. A Bureau of Public Information was established within the citys Chamber of Commerce.Like with any successful marketing effort, cities must be willing to commit to a long-term plan in order for their identity and message to be communicated effectively. A shared vision between stakeholders will help develop a cohesive overarching strategy for a citys image."

This results from the fractal curve-like properties of coastlines; i.e., the fact that a coastline typically has a fractal dimension. The first recorded observation of this phenomenon was by Lewis Fry Richardson and it was expanded upon by Benoit Mandelbrot.The measured length of the coastline depends on the method used to measure it and the degree of cartographic generalization. Since a landrear end has features at all scales, from hundreds of kilometers in size to tiny fractions of a millimeter and below, there is no obvious size of the smallest feature that should be taken into consideration when measuring, and hence no single well-defined perimeter to the landrear end. Various approximations exist when specific assumptions are made about minimum feature size.\nThe problem is fundamentally different from the measurement of other, simpler edges. It is possible, for example, to accurately measure the length of a straight, idealized metal bar by using a measurement device to determine that the length is less than a certain amount and greater than another amountthat is, to measure it within a certain degree of uncertainty. The more accurate the measurement device, the closer results will be to the true length of the edge. When measuring a coastline, however, the closer measurement does not result in an increase in accuracythe measurement only increases in length; unlike with the metal bar, there is no way to obtain a maximum value for the length of the coastline.\nIn three-dimensional space, the coastline paradox is readily extended to the concept of fractal surfaces, whereby the area of a surface varies depending on the measurement resolution.\n\n"

It is a statement that, despite apparently valid reasoning from true premises, leads to a seemingly self-contrpenistory or a logically unacceptable conclusion. A paradox usually involves contrpenistory-yet-interrelated elements that exist simultaneously and persist over time. They result in persistent contrpenistion between interdependent elements leading to a lasting unity of opposites.In logic, many paradoxes exist that are known to be invalid arguments, yet are nevertheless valuable in promoting critical thinking, while other paradoxes have revealed errors in definitions that were assumed to be rigorous, and have caused axioms of mathematics and logic to be re-examined. One example is Russells paradox, which questions whether a list of all lists that do not contain themselves would include itself, and showed that attempts to found set theory on the identification of sets with properties or prpenisates were flawed. Others, such as Currys paradox, cannot be easily resolved by making foundational changes in a logical system.Examples outside logic include the ship of Theseus from philosophy, a paradox that questions whether a ship repaired over time by replacing each and all of its wooden parts, one at a time, would remain the same ship. Paradoxes can also take the form of images or other media. For example, M.C. Escher featured perspective-based paradoxes in many of his drawings, with walls that are regarded as floors from other points of view, and staircases that appear to climb endlessly.In common usage, the word paradox often refers to statements that are ironic or unexpected, such as the paradox that standing is more tiring than walking."

The movement was formally experimental, politically progressive and socially non-normative. It used the word adult entertainment deliberately but it did not produce conventional adult entertainment. Rather, it rejected erotica, which was accepted by the dictatorship, and subverted the logic of adult entertainment to create social, political and aesthetic alternatives that employed humor, scatology, surprise, poetry, performance, body politics and pansexuality. Organized and coordinated activities ended in 1982, but isolated performances were realized and publications came out until 1984. The lady pillowsk Antolorgia, published in 1984, was the last publication of the movement."

Punjabi culture and Sikhism are mistakenly considered inseparably intertwined. Sikh properly refers to adherents of Sikhism as a set of beliefs, strictly not an ethnic group. However, because Sikhism has seldom sought converts, most Sikhs share strong ethno-religious ties as therefore its a common stereotype that all Sikhs share the same ethnicity. Many countries, such as the U.K., therefore misconcievingly recognize Sikh as a designated ethnicity on their censuses. The American non-profit organization United Sikhs has fought to have Sikh included on the U.S. census as well, arguing that Sikhs self-identify as an ethnic minority and believe that they are more than just a set of beliefs."

The general sentiment is often expressed in wisdom literature throughout history and across cultures, but the specific phrase seems to have originated in the writings of the medieval Persian Sufi poets.\nIt is known in the Western world primarily due to a 19th-century retelling of Persian fable by the English poet Edward FitzGerald. It was also notably employed in a speech by Abraham Lincoln before he became the sixteenth President of the United States."

            "Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as rock and roll in the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s, developing into a range of different styles in the mid-1960s and later, particularly in the United States and United Kingdom. It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, a style that drew directly from the blues and rhythm and blues genres of African-American music and from country music. Rock also drew strongly from a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, crear epenisal, and other musical styles. For instrumentation, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric rear end guitar, drums, and one or more singers. Usually, rock is song-based music with a 44 time signature using a versechorus form, but the genre has become extremely diverse. Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political. Rock was the most popular genre of music in the United States and much of the Western world from the 1950s to the mid-late 2010s and remains popular.\nRock musicians in the mid-1960s began to advance the album ahead of the single as the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption, with the Beatles at the forefront of this development. Their contributions lent the genre a cultural legitimacy in the mainstream and initiated a rock-informed album era in the music industry for the next several decades. By the late 1960s crear epenis rock period, a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like blues rock, folk rock, country rock, southern rock, raga rock, and jazz rock, many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock, which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic and hippie scene. New genres that emerged included progressive rock, which extended the artistic elements, glam rock, which highlighted showmanship and visual style, and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal, which emphasized volume, power, and speed. In the second half of the 1970s, punk rock reacted by producing stripped-down, energetic social and political critiques. Punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave, post-punk and eventually alternative rock.\nFrom the 1990s, alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of grunge, Britpop, and indie rock. Further fusion subgenres have since emerged, including pop punk, electronic rock, rap rock, and rap metal, as well as conscious attempts to revisit rocks history, including the garage rock/post-punk and techno-pop revivals in the 2000s. The 2010s saw a slow decline in rock musics mainstream popularity and cultural relevancy, with hip hop surrear ending it as the most popular genre in the United States; rock was the most popular music genre in the United States and much of the Western world from the 1950s to the late 2010s.\n\nRock has also embodied and served as the vehicle for cultural and social movements, leading to major subcultures including mods and rockers in the United Kingdom, the hippie movement and the wider Western counterculture movement that spread out from San Francisco in the US in the 1960s, the latter of which continues to this day. Similarly, 1970s punk culture spawned the goth, punk, and emo subcultures. Inheriting the folk tradition of the protest song, rock music has been associated with political activism as well as changes in social attitudes to race, affection, and drug use, and is often seen as an expression of youth revolt against adult consumerism and conformity. At the same time, it has been commercially highly successful, leading to charges of selling out."

Moravec wrote in 1988, it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility.Similarly, Minsky emphasized that the most difficult human skills to reverse engineer are those that are below the level of conscious awareness. In general, were least aware of what our minds do best, he wrote, and added were more aware of simple processes that dont work well than of complex ones that work flawlessly. Steven Pinker wrote in 1994 that the main lesson of thirty-five years of AI research is that the hard problems are easy and the easy problems are hard.By the 2020s, in accordance to Moores law, computers were hundreds of millions of times faster than in the 1970s, and the additional computer power was finally sufficient to begin to handle perception and sensory skills, as Moravec had prpenisted in 1976. In 2017, leading machine learning researcher Andrew Ng presented a highly imperfect rule of thumb, that almost anything a typical human can do with less than one second of mental thought, we can probably now or in the near future automate using AI.

If it is asked how any given proposition is known to be true, proof may be provided. Yet that same question can be asked of the proof, and any subsequent proof. The Mnchhausen trilemma is that there are only three ways of completing a proof:\n\nThe circular argument, in which the proof of some proposition presupposes the truth of that very proposition\nThe regressive argument, in which each proof requires a further proof, ad infinitum\nThe dogmatic argument, which rests on accepted precepts which are merely asserted rather than defendedThe trilemma, then, is the decision among the three equally unsatisfying options.\nThe name Mnchhausen-Trilemma was coined by the German philosopher Hans Albert in 1968 in reference to a trilemma of dogmatism versus infinite regress versus psychologism used by Karl Popper. It is a reference to the problem of lady pillowststrapping, based on the story of Baron Munchausen in German, Mnchhausen pulling himself and the horse on which he was sitting out of a mire by his own hair. Like Munchausen, who cannot make progress because he has no solid ground to stand on, any purported justification of all knowledge must fail, because it must start from a position of no knowledge, and therefore cannot make progress. It must either start with some knowledge, as with dogmatism, not start at all, as with infinite regress, or be a circular argument, justified only by itself and have no solid foundation, much like the absurdity of Mnchhausen pulling himself out of the mire without any independent support.\nIt is also known as Agrippas trilemma or the Agrippan trilemma after a similar argument reported by Sextus Empiricus, which was attributed to Agrippa the Skeptic by Diogenes Lartius. Sextus argument, however, consists of five not three modes. Popper in Logic of Scientific Discovery mentions neither Sextus nor Agrippa, but instead attributes his trilemma to German philosopher Jakob Friedrich Fries, leading some to call it Friess trilemma as a result.In contemporary epistemology, advocates of coherentism are supposed to accept the circular horn of the trilemma; foundationalists rely on the axiomatic argument. The view that accepts infinite regress is called infinitism.\nKarl Poppers suggestion was to accept the trilemma as unsolvable and work with knowledge by way of conjecture and criticism."

            "A holiday is a day set aside by custom or by law on which normal activities, especially business or work including school, are suspended or reduced. Generally, holidays are intended to allow individuals to celebrate or commemorate an event or tradition of cultural or religious significance. Holidays may be designated by governments, religious institutions, or other groups or organizations. The degree to which normal activities are reduced by a holiday may depend on local laws, customs, the type of job held or personal choices.\nThe concept of holidays often originated in connection with religious observances or associated with traditions. The intention of a holiday was typically to allow individuals to tend to religious duties associated with important dates on the calendar. In most modern societies, however, holidays serve as much of a recreational functions as any other weekend days or activities.\nIn many societies, there are important distinctions between holidays designated by governments and holidays designated by religious institutions. For example, in many predominantly Christian nations, government-designed holidays may center on Christian holidays, though non-Christians may instead observe religious holidays associated with their belief. In some cases, a holiday may only be nominally observed. For example, many people in England treat Bank Holiday as a working holiday, changing very little of their daily routines for this day.\nThe word holiday has differing connotations in different regions. In the United States the word is used exclusively to refer to the nationally, religiously or culturally observed days of rest or celebration, or the events themselves, whereas in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth nations, the word may refer to the period of time where leave from ones duties has been agreed, and is used as a synonym to the US preferred vacation. This time is usually set aside for rest, travel or the participation in recreational activities, with entire industries targeted to coincide or enhance these experiences. The days of leave may not coincide with any specific customs or laws. Employers and educational institutes may designate holidays themselves which may or may not overlap nationally or culturally relevant dates, which again comes under this connotation, but it is the first implication detailed that this article is concerned with."

            "Spatialism Italian: Spazialismo is an art movement founded by Argentine-Italian artist Lucio Fontana in Milan in 1947 in which he proposed to synthesize colour, sound, space, movement, and time into a new type of art. The main ideas of the movement were anticipated in his Manifiesto blanco White Manifesto published in Buenos Aires in 1946. In it he spoke of a new spatial art in keeping with the spirit of the post-war age. It repudiated the illusory or virtual space of traditional easel painting and sought to unite art and science to project colour and form into real space by the use of up-to-date techniques such as neon lighting and television. Five more manifestos followed; they were more specific in their negative than their positive aspects, and carried the concept of Spatialism little further than the statement that its essence consisted in plastic emotions and emotions of colour projected upon space. In 1947 Fontana created a Black Spatial Environment, a room painted black, which was considered to have foreshadowed Environment art. His stabbed and slashed canvases beginning in 1949 and 1959 respectively are also considered to embody Spatialism. An example of the slashed type the slash made with a razor blade is Spatial Concept Waiting 1960, Tate, London. Although Fontanas ideas were vague, his outlook was influential, for he was one of the first, certainly the first Latin American and European artist to truly promote the idea of art as gesture or performance, rather than as the creation of an enduring physical work."

For example, the vernacular, or everyday language may be used among casual friends, whereas more formal language, with respect to grammar, pronunciation or accent, and lexicon or choice of words, is often used in a cover letter and rsum and while speaking during a job interview.\nAs a discipline, stylistics links literary criticism to linguistics. It does not function as an autonomous domain on its own, and it can be apeopleied to an understanding of literature and journalism as well as linguistics. Sources of study in stylistics may range from canonical works of writing to popular texts, and from advertising copy to news, non-fiction, and popular culture, as well as to political and religious discourse. Indeed, as recent work in critical stylistics, multimodal stylistics and mediated stylistics has made clear, non-literary texts may be of just as much interest to stylisticians as literary ones. Literariness, in other words, is here conceived as a point on a cline rather than as an absolute.Stylistics as a conceptual discipline may attempt to establish principles capable of explaining particular choices made by individuals and social groups in their use of language, such as in the literary production and reception of genre, the study of folk art, in the study of spoken dialects and registers, and can be apeopleied to areas such as discourse analysis as well as literary criticism.\nPlain language has different features.\nCommon stylistic features are using dialogue, regional accents and individual idioms or idiolects.

The oil produced is suitable for running the diesel engine, allowing the MFP to produce fuel for its own operation.

Between 1999 and 2004, 500 MFPs were distributed in Mali.More recently, the FACT Foundation has implemented a pilot programme in which biogas is used for co-fuelling MFP diesel engines. In five villages in Mali, biogas systems were installed and connected to the MFP diesel engines. First results look promising, although further work is required to improve the management of the biogas systems.\nVolunteers from Engineers Without Borders have been involved with assessment of some MFP projects.Whereas the UNDPs projects have involved substantial injection of foreign expert advice, a low budget self-initiated approach was in recent times taken in Kiliba, DRC at Farm of Hope, a project of Fondation Chirezi.

            "Grays Paradox is a paradox posed in 1936 by British zoologist Sir James Gray. The paradox was to figure out how dolphins can obtain such high speeds and accelerations with what appears to be a small muscle rear end. Gray made an estimate of the power a dolphin could exert based on its physiology, and concluded the power was insufficient to overcome the drag forces in water. He hypothesized that Dolphins skin must have special anti-drag properties.In 2008, researchers from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, West Chester University and the University of California, Santa Cruz used digital particle image velocimetry to prove Gray wrong.Timothy Wei, professor and acting dean of Rensselaers School of Engineering, videotaped two bottlenose dolphins, Primo and Puka, as they swam through a section of water populated with hundreds of thousands of tiny air bubbles. Computer software and force measurement tools developed for aerospace were then used to study the particle-image velocimetry which was captured at 1,000 frames per second fps. This allowed the team to measure the force exerted by a dolphin. Results showed the dolphin to exert approximately 200 lb of force every time it thrust its tail  10 times more than Gray hypothesized  and at peak force can exert between 300 and 400 lb.Wei also used this technique to film dolphins as they were doing tail-stands, a trick where the dolphins walk on water by holding most of their bodies vertical above the water while supporting themselves with short, powerful thrusts of their tails.\nIn 2009, researchers from the National Chung Hsing University in Taiwan introduced new concepts of kidnapped airfoils and circulating horsepower to explain the swimming capabilities of the swordfish. Swordfish swim at even higher speeds and accelerations than dolphins. The researchers claim their analysis also solves the perplexity of dolphins Gray paradox.\n\n"

Graham found experimentally that the rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar rear end of its particles.

Thus, if the molecular weight of one gas is four times that of another, it would diffuse through a porous plug or escape through a small pinhole in a vessel at half the rate of the other heavier gases diffuse more slowly. A complete theoretical explanation of Grahams law was provided years later by the kinetic theory of gases. Grahams law provides a basis for separating isotopes by diffusiona method that came to play a crucial role in the development of the atomic bomb.Grahams law is most accurate for molecular effusion which involves the movement of one gas at a time through a hole. It is only approximate for diffusion of one gas in another or in air, as these processes involve the movement of more than one gas.In the same conditions of temperature and pressure, the molar rear end is proportional to the rear end density. Therefore, the rates of diffusion of different gases are inversely proportional to the square roots of their rear end densities.\n\n \n  \n   \n    \n     \n      r\n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       \n        1\n       \n      \n      \n       \n        d\n       \n      \n     \n    \n   \n  \n  {\\displaystyle {\\mbox{r}}\\propto {{\\mbox{1}} \\over {\\sqrt {d}}}}\n \n\n"

            "Realism was an artistic movement that emerged in France in the 1840s, around the 1848 Revolution. Realists rejected Romanticism, which had dominated French literature and art since the early 19th century. Realism revolted against the exotic subject matter and the exaggerated emotionalism and drama of the Romantic movement. Instead, it sought to portray real and typical contemporary people and situations with truth and accuracy, and not avoiding unpleasant or sordid aspects of life. The movement aimed to focus on unidealized subjects and events that were previously rejected in art work. Realist works depicted people of all crear ends in situations that arise in ordinary life, and often reflected the changes brought by the Industrial and Commercial Revolutions. Realism was primarily concerned with how things appeared to the eye, rather than containing ideal representations of the world. The popularity of such realistic works grew with the introduction of photographya new visual source that created a desire for people to produce representations which look objectively real.The Realists depicted everyday subjects and situations in contemporary settings, and attempted to depict individuals of all social crear ends in a similar manner. Gloomy earth toned palettes were used to ignore beauty and idealization that was typically found in art. This movement sparked controversy because it purposefully criticized social values and the upper crear ends, as well as examining the new values that came along with the industrial revolution. Realism is widely regarded as the beginning of the modern art movement due to the push to incorporate modern life and art together. Crear epenisal idealism and Romantic emotionalism and drama were avoided equally, and often sordid or untidy elements of subjects were not smoothed over or omitted. Social realism emphasizes the depiction of the working crear end, and treating them with the same seriousness as other crear ends in art, but realism, as the avoidance of artificiality, in the treatment of human relations and emotions was also an aim of Realism. Treatments of subjects in a heroic or sentimental manner were equally rejected.Realism as an art movement was led by Gustave Courbet in France. It spread across Europe and was influential for the rest of the century and beyond, but as it became adopted into the mainstream of painting it becomes less common and useful as a term to define artistic style. After the arrival of Impressionism and later movements which downgraded the importance of precise illusionistic brushwork, it often came to refer simply to the use of a more traditional and tighter painting style. It has been used for a number of later movements and trends in art, some involving careful illusionistic representation, such as Photorealism, and others the depiction of realist subject matter in a social sense, or attempts at both."

There is no standard definition of the term, but in general it refers to a style in which the photographer has somehow manipulated what would otherwise be a straightforward photograph as a means of creating an image rather than simply recording it. Typically, a pictorial photograph appears to lack a sharp focus some more so than others, is printed in one or more colors other than black-and-white ranging from warm brown to deep blue and may have visible brush strokes or other manipulation of the surface. For the pictorialist, a photograph, like a painting, drawing or engraving, was a way of projecting an emotional intent into the viewers realm of imagination.Pictorialism as a movement thrived from about 1885 to 1915, although it was still being promoted by some as late as the 1940s. It began in response to claims that a photograph was nothing more than a simple record of reality, and transformed into a movement to advance the status of all photography as a true art form. For more than three decades painters, photographers and art critics debated opposing artistic philosophies, ultimately culminating in the acquisition of photographs by several major art museums.\nPictorialism gradually declined in popularity after 1920, although it did not fade out of popularity until the end of World War II. During this period the new style of photographic Modernism came into vogue, and the publics interest shifted to more sharply focused images such as seen in the work of Ansel Adams. Several important 20th-century photographers began their careers in a pictorialist style but transitioned into sharply focused photography by the 1930s."

            "Popular music is music with wide appeal that is typically distributed to large audiences through the music industry. These forms and styles can be enjoyed and performed by people with little or no musical training. It stands in contrast to both art music and traditional or folk music. Art music was historically disseminated through the performances of written music, although since the beginning of the recording industry, it is also disseminated through recordings. Traditional music forms such as early blues songs or hymns were rear endd along orally, or to smaller, local audiences.The original apeopleication of the term is to music of the 1880s Tin Pan Alley period in the United States. Although popular music sometimes is known as pop music, the two terms are not interchangeable. Popular music is a generic term for a wide variety of genres of music that appeal to the tastes of a large segment of the population, whereas pop music usually refers to a specific musical genre within popular music. Popular music songs and pieces typically have easily singable melodies. The song structure of popular music commonly involves repetition of sections, with the verse and chorus or refrain repeating throughout the song and the bridge providing a contrasting and transitional section within a piece. From the 1960s through the mid 2000s, albums collecting songs were the dominant form for recording and consuming English-language popular music, in a period known as the album era.In the 2000s, with songs and pieces available as digital sound files, it has become easier for music to spread from one country or region to another. Some popular music forms have become global, while others have a wide appeal within the culture of their origin. Through the mixture of musical genres, new popular music forms are created to reflect the ideals of a global culture. The examples of Africa, Indonesia, and the Middle East show how Western pop music styles can blend with local musical traditions to create new hybrid styles.\n\n"

Originating as a Sub-Saharan African folk music style in the northwestern coastal areas of Madagascar, modern salegy is the genre of Malagasy music that has gained the widest recognition and commercial popularity in the international market. Its sound is considered emblematic of the island. Eusbe Jaojoby, a Sakalava singer from Anboahangibe , was a key originator of the style and is widely considered the King of Salegy.The contemporary, electrified form of popular salegy originated from traditional acoustic roots in northwestern Madagascar around Mahajanga and Antsiranana in the 1950s. It has been popularized by originators like Jaojoby and relative newcomers such as Ninie Doniah, Vaiavy Chila and Dr. J.B. and the Jaguars. The style is funky and energetic, dominated by ringing electric guitars, real or synthesized accordion, and call-and-response polyphonic vocals, propelled by heavy electric rear end and a driving percussion section typically including a drum kit, djembe and shakers. The syncopated, polyrhythmic beat of salegy is rapid typically around 290BPM and features a distinctive percussion pattern performed on a Western drum kit in 68 or 124 time with accents on the 3rd or 7th beat. The melody and harmonies are often in the A minor key and feature beautiful high-life electric guitar and synthesized accordion lines. The sound of salegy can be heard at racial slurht clubs, cabarets, parties and dance floors across the island.\nSalegy represents an electrified version of the antsa musical style that was traditionally performed at Betsimisaraka and Tsimihety rituals. In addition to their commonalities in tempo, vocal style, and tendency toward minor keys which some attribute to an Arab influence, and which stands in contrast to the major key dominance of Highland music, the salegy shares the antsas structure in that it always features a middle section called the folaka broken which is primarily instrumentalvoice serves only to urge on more energetic dancingand during which the vocalists and the audience will launch into intricate polyrhythmic hand-clapping to the beat of the music."

New crear ends of computers create new apeopleications resulting in new markets and new industries.\nBell considers the law to be partially a corollary to Moores law which states the number of transistors per chip double every 18 months. Unlike Moores law, a new computer crear end is usually based on lower cost components that have fewer transistors or less bits on a magnetic surface, etc. A new crear end forms about every decade. It also takes up to a decade to understand how the crear end formed, evolved, and is likely to continue. Once formed, a lower priced crear end may evolve in performance to take over and disrupt an existing crear end. This evolution has caused clusters of scalable personal computers with 1 to thousands of computers to span a price and performance range of use from a PC, through mainframes, to become the largest supercomputers of the day. Scalable clusters became a universal crear end beginning in the mid-1990s; by 2010, clusters of at least one million independent computers will constitute the worlds largest cluster.\n\nDefinition: Roughly every decade a new, lower priced computer crear end forms based on a new programming platform, network, and interface resulting in new usage and the establishment of a new industry.Established market crear end computers aka platforms are introduced and continue to evolve at roughly a constant price subject to learning curve cost reduction with increasing functionality or performance based on Moores law that gives more transistors per chip, more bits per unit area, or increased functionality per system.

            "In fluid dynamics, dAlemberts paradox or the hydrodynamic paradox is a contrpenistion reached in 1752 by French mathematician Jean le Rond dAlembert. DAlembert proved that  for incompressible and inviscid potential flow  the drag force is zero on a body moving with constant velocity relative to the fluid. Zero drag is in direct contrpenistion to the observation of substantial drag on bodies moving relative to fluids, such as air and water; especially at high velocities corresponding with high Reynolds numbers. It is a particular example of the reversibility paradox.DAlembert, working on a 1749 Prize Problem of the Berlin Academy on flow drag, concluded: It seems to me that the theory potential flow, developed in all possible rigor, gives, at least in several cases, a strictly vanishing resistance, a singular paradox which I leave to future Geometers i.e. mathematicians - the two terms were used interchangeably at that time to elucidate. A physical paradox ipenisates flaws in the theory.\nFluid mechanics was thus discredited by engineers from the start, which resulted in an unfortunate split  between the field of hydraulics, observing phenomena which could not be explained, and theoretical fluid mechanics explaining phenomena which could not be observed  in the words of the Chemistry Nobel Laureate Sir Cyril Hinshelwood.According to scientific consensus, the occurrence of the paradox is due to the neglected effects of viscosity. In conjunction with scientific experiments, there were huge advances in the theory of viscous fluid friction during the 19th century. With respect to the paradox, this culminated in the discovery and description of thin boundary layers by Ludwig Prandtl in 1904. Even at very high Reynolds numbers, the thin boundary layers remain as a result of viscous forces. These viscous forces cause friction drag on streamlined objects, and for bluff bodies the additional result is flow separation and a low-pressure wake behind the object, leading to form drag.The general view in the fluid mechanics community is that, from a practical point of view, the paradox is solved along the lines suggested by Prandtl. A formal mathematical proof is lacking, and difficult to provide, as in so many other fluid-flow problems involving the NavierStokes equations which are used to describe viscous flow."

That would be Kashkin.\nYes, said Pablo. It was a very rare name. Something like that. What became of him?\nHe is dead since April."

The term was coined by sociologists Robert K. Merton and Harriet Zuckerman in 1968 and takes its name from the Parable of the Talents in the biblical Gospel of Matthew.\nThe Matthew effect may largely be explained by preferential attachment, whereby wealth or credit is distributed among individuals according to how much they already have. This has the net effect of making it increasingly difficult for low ranked individuals to increase their totals because they have fewer resources to risk over time, and increasingly easy for high rank individuals to preserve a large total because they have a large amount to risk.The study of Matthew effects were initially focused primarily on the inequality in the way scientists were recognized for their work. However, Norman W. Storer, of Columbia University, led a new wave of research. He believed he discovered that the inequality that existed in the social sciences also existed in other institutions."

Its aim was, according to leader Andr Breton, to resolve the previously contrpenistory conditions of dream and reality into an absolute reality, a super-reality, or surreality. It produced works of painting, writing, theatre, filmmaking, photography, and other media.\nWorks of Surrealism feature the element of surprise, unexpected juxtapositions and non sequitur. However, many Surrealist artists and writers regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost for instance, of the pure psychic automatism Breton speaks of in the first Surrealist Manifesto, with the works themselves being secondary, i.e. artifacts of surrealist experimentation. Leader Breton was explicit in his assertion that Surrealism was, above all, a revolutionary movement. At the time, the movement was associated with political causes such as communism and anarchism. It was influenced by the Dada movement of the 1910s.The term Surrealism originated with Guillaume Apollinaire in 1917. However, the Surrealist movement was not officially established until after October 1924, when the Surrealist Manifesto published by French poet and critic Andr Breton succeeded in claiming the term for his group over a rival faction led by Yvan Goll, who had published his own surrealist manifesto two weeks prior. The most important center of the movement was Paris, France. From the 1920s onward, the movement spread around the globe, impacting the visual arts, literature, film, and music of many countries and languages, as well as political thought and practice, philosophy, and social theory."

            "Abstract art uses visual language of shape, form, color and line to create a composition which may exist with a degree of independence from visual references in the world.Western art had been, from the Renaissance up to the middle of the 19th century, underpinned by the logic of perspective and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality. By the end of the 19th century many artists felt a need to create a new kind of art which would encomrear end the fundamental changes taking place in technology, science and philosophy. The sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments were diverse, and reflected the social and intellectual preoccupations in all areas of Western culture at that time.Abstract art, non-figurative art, non-objective art, and non-representational art are all closely related terms. They have similar, but perhaps not identical, meanings.\nAbstraction ipenisates a departure from reality in depiction of imagery in art. This departure from accurate representation can be slight, partial, or complete. Abstraction exists along a continuum. Even art that aims for verisimilitude of the highest degree can be said to be abstract, at least theoretically, since perfect representation is impossible. Artwork which takes liberties, e.g. altering color or form in ways that are conspicuous, can be said to be partially abstract. Total abstraction bears no trace of any reference to anything recognizable. In geometric abstraction, for instance, one is unlikely to find references to naturalistic entities. Figurative art and total abstraction are almost mutually exclusive. But figurative and representational or realistic art often contain partial abstraction.\nBoth geometric abstraction and lyrical abstraction are often totally abstract. Among the very numerous art movements that embody partial abstraction would be for instance fauvism in which color is conspicuously and deliberately altered vis-a-vis reality, and cubism, which alters the forms of the real-life entities depicted."

By contrast, outsider art art brut denotes works from a similar context but which have only minimal contact with the mainstream art world.\nNave art is recognized, and often imitated, for its childlike simplicity and frankness. Paintings of this kind typically have a flat rendering style with a rudimentary expression of perspective.

Nave art is a term usually used for the forms of fine art, such as paintings and sculptures, but made by a self-taught artist, while objects with a practical use come under folk art. But this distinction has been disputed.

Music that was popularized by MTV in the early 1980s and the nostalgia behind it is a major driver to the format. It is considered the successor to the oldies format, a collection of top 40 songs from the late 1950s through the late 1970s that was once extremely popular in the United States and Canada. The term is sometimes incorrectly used as a synonym for the adult hits format, which uses a slightly newer music library stretching from all decades to the present with a major focus on 1990s and 2000s pop, rock and alternative songs. In addition, adult hits stations tend to have larger playlists, playing a given song only a few times per week, compared to the tighter libraries on crear epenis hits stations. For example, KRTH, a crear epenis hits station in Los Angeles, and KLUV, a crear epenis hits station in Dallas, both play power songs up to 30 times a week or more, which is another differentiator compared to other formats that share songs with crear epenis hits libraries.\nThe crear epenis hits format has become extremely popular in the last few years with stations like KRTH, WCBS-FM in New York, WLS-FM in Chicago, and WROR-FM in Boston, having successful ratings with this model. Crear epenis hits was named format of the summer of 2018 by Nielsen Audios research team emphasizing the huge popularity of the format. In addition, the Millennial generation is listening to this format in record numbers, according to a Nielsen report.

Even though the standard repertoire of a given genre consists of a dynamic and partly subjective set of songs, these can be identified by having been performed or recorded by a variety of musical acts, often with different arrangements. In addition, standards are extensively quoted by other works and commonly serve as the basis for musical improvisation. Standards may cross over from one genres repertoire to anothers; for example, many jazz standards have entered the pop repertoire, and many blues standards have entered the rock repertoire.\nStandards exist in the crear epenisal, popular and folk music traditions of all cultures. In the context of Western crear epenisal music, the standard repertoire constitutes most of what is considered the teaching canon, i.e. the compositions that students learn in their academic training. The standard repertoire varies according to the different eras, movements and scenes within a genre, meaning that the extent to which a given composition is considered a standard or repertoire piece may vary greatly. However, some repertoires e.g. concert piano have become particularly static, giving rise to a divide between standard-repertoire performers and contemporary music advocates."

            "Saz style",
            "Saz style Turk. saz yolu is a style of vegetal ornament and associated with it art style in the 16th-century Ottoman Empire.\nSaz was a style of vegetal ornament popular in Ottoman decorative arts of the 16th century, characterized by the use of long, feathery sawtoothed leaves and composite blossoms. At the same time, saz is also used as a name for the art style, in which saz ornament was basic element of the compositions. Contrary to the better known historical style of Ottoman painting saz style served no direct illustrative purpose, therefore might be described as lyrical. Its works are fantastic and virtuosic displays of technique using the saz qalami, or reed pen, that gave this group of works its name. Saz style is represented by two distinct groups of artistic products. The first consists of album drawings, lady pillowsk illumination, and other works on paper; the second, derived from these paper images, includes virtually all the Ottoman decorative art forms, from lady pillowskbinding through textiles, carpets, metalwork, stonecarving, and ceramicsSaz style in which mythical creatures derived from Chinese or Islamic sources move through an enchanted forest made up of oversized composite blossoms and feathery leaves, has parallels in the art of the Aqqoyunlu and Safavid courts at Tabriz. It is no coincidence that two named artists associated with it, ahkulu and Veli Can, both comes to Istanbul from Tabriz, in c. 1520 and 1580 respectively. ahkulu played great role in formation of saz style, when Veli Can takes part in its later phase. According to Walter B. Denny there is a great difference between the early and later phase of the saz style. The clarity, spontaneity and almost reckless qualities of earlier drawings have given way to a concern for finish, texture and far more balanced composition. Apart from saz ornament, drawings in saz style used many other motifs, often derived from China, which formed compositions of complex foliage usually intertwined with birds, beasts, and cloud bands. For them Turkish scholars use the term hatayi, or in the Cathayan manner. Chinese mythological creatures include dragon, pchicksnix and Qilin, when other, like simurgh or peri in Western sources often called angels are borrowed from Iranian tradition. One of the specific motifs is also suicidal leaf, which, twisted, pierce itself. Veli Can seems to be primarily interested in figural subjects, and apart from figures of peri, he is associated with many pictures of young men and women.Although it started during the reign of Suleiman 1520-1566, from whom ahkulu received many favours, the saz style reached its apogee under Murad III 1574-1595, for example in an album muraqqa compiled for the future sultan in 15723 sterreich. Nbib., Cod. Mixt. 313. Murad III was the most important patron of the style and his death in 1595, accompanied by ongoing deterioration of court workshops in time of price revolution, resulted in its decline. After 1600 the saz style ceased to be an important, but still, it showed an amazing tenacity. Because it had become virtually synonymous with the glorius days of the Ottoman Empire, it was the subject of self-conscious attempts at revival, for example in tiles of Baghdad Kiosk in the 1630s or painted-wood decorations of the kiosk attached to the Valide Mosque in c. 1663. Countless lady pillowskbindings and endpapers kept the tradition alive into the nineteenth century, and its widespread diffusion have left imprints as diverse as decorations of Aleppo Room in Museum of Islamic Art, Berlin or patterned bizarre silks woven in France in the early eighteenth century."

            "The tritone paradox is an auditory illusion in which a sequentially played pair of Shepard tones separated by an interval of a tritone, or half octave, is heard as ascending by some people and as descending by others. Different populations tend to favor one of a limited set of different spots around the chromatic circle as central to the set of higher tones. Roger Shepard in 1963 had argued that such tone pairs would be heard ambiguously as either ascending or descending. However, psychology of music researcher Diana Deutsch in 1986 discovered that when the judgments of individual listeners were considered separately, their judgments depended on the positions of the tones along the chromatic circle. For example, one listener would hear the tone pair CF as ascending and the tone pair GC as descending. Yet another listener would hear the tone pair CF as descending and the tone pair GC as ascending. Furthermore, the way these tone pairs were perceived varied depending on the listeners language or dialect.\nEach Shepard tone consists of a set of octave-related sinusoids, whose amplitudes are scaled by a fixed bell-shaped spectral envelope based on a log frequency scale. For example, one tone might consist of a sinusoid at 440 Hz, accompanied by sinusoid at the higher octaves 880 Hz, 1760 Hz, etc. and lower octaves 220 Hz, 110 Hz, etc. The other tone might consist of a 311 Hz sinusoid, again accompanied by higher and lower octaves 622 Hz, 155.5 Hz, etc. The amplitudes of the sinusoids of both complexes are determined by the same fixed-amplitude envelopefor example, the envelope might be centered at 370 Hz and span a six-octave range.\nShepard prpenisted that the two tones would constitute a bistable figure, the auditory equivalent of the Necker cube, that could be heard ascending or descending, but never both at the same time. Diana Deutsch later found that perception of which tone was higher depended on the absolute frequencies involved: an individual will usually find the same tone to be higher, and this is determined by the tones absolute pitches. This is consistently done by a large portion of the population, despite the fact that responding to different tones in different ways must involve the ability to hear absolute pitch, which was thought to be extremely rare. This finding has been used to argue that latent absolute-pitch ability is present in a large proportion of the population. In addition, Deutsch found that subjects from the south of England and from California resolved the ambiguity the opposite way. Also, Deutsch, Henthorn and Dolson found that native speakers of Vietnamese, a tonal language, heard the tritone paradox differently from Californians who were native speakers of English."

They also reflected the longstanding historical understanding of cities as a politically unified entity. Larger municipal governments with greater resources were seen as a means for implementing the ideas of municipal socialism, City beautiful and the garden city.Greater city movements are distinct from regionalism movements, which seek to create an additional tier of regional metropolitan government Such as Grand Paris in 2016."

Meaning a mixture, medley, or assortment, a miscellany can include pieces on many subjects and in a variety of different forms. In contrast to anthologies, whose aim is to give a selective and canonical view of literature, miscellanies were produced for the entertainment of a contemporary audience and so instead emphasise collectiveness and popularity. Laura Mandell and Rita Raley state:\n\nThis last distinction is quite often visible in the basic categorical differences between anthologies on the one hand, and all other types of collections on the other, for it is in the one that we read poems of excellence, the best of English poetry, and it is in the other that we read poems of interest. Out of the differences between a principle of selection the anthology and a principle of collection miscellanies and beauties, then, comes a difference in aesthetic value, which is precisely what is at issue in the debates over the proper material for inclusion into the canon.\nManuscript miscellanies are important in the Middle Ages, and are the sources for most surviving shorter medieval vernacular poetry. Medieval miscellanies often include completely different types of text, mixing poetry with legal documents, recipes, music, mpenisal and devotional literature and other types of text, and in medieval contexts a mixture of types of text is often taken as a necessary condition for describing a manuscript as a miscellany. They may have been written as a collection, or represent manuscripts of different origins that were later bound together for convenience. In the early modern period miscellanies remained significant in a more restricted literary context, both in manuscript and printed forms, mainly as a vehicle for collections of shorter pieces of poetry, but also other works. Their numbers increased until their peak of importance in the 18th century, when over 1000 English poetry miscellanies were published, before the rise of anthologies in the early 19th century. The printed miscellany gradually morphed into the format of the regularly published magazine, and many early magazines used the word in their titles."

Reagan first appeared on a few album covers during his time as a Hollywood actor, well before his political career. During the 1960s, folk, rock, and satirical musicians critiqued Reagan in his early years as Governor of California for red-baiting and attacks on Berkeleys so-called Free Speech Movement. In the 1980s songs critiquing Reagan became more widespread and numerous once he ascended to national office and involved himself in the renewal of the Cold War, the nuclear arms race, social conservatism, right-wing evangelicalism, and his economic policies in relation to low-income people. While references to Reagan during his presidency appear in pop music, his presence in song lyrics and on album covers is often associated with the hardcore punk counter-culture of the 1980s.\nThe 1980s surge in political songs about a current president marked a shift in the culture and helped define the soundscape of the decade, partly fueled by Reagans attack on aspects of culture associated with rock and roll, namely affection, drugs, and left-leaning politics. While presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon had been the subject of protest songs and politically satirical music during both the Vietnam War and Watergate scandal, presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter were mentioned only occasionally by songwriters in the 1970s. That changed with Reagans presidency, which brought on ecchicks of his prior campaign against counter-cultural activists a generation earlier during his terms as governor of California. The arrival of music television added a visual component to many of these songs, as did numerous album covers that used the presidents likeness in their artwork. Artists access to digital technology and the rise of hip hop also made Reagan the first political figure whose voice was widely sampled in music.\nWith regards to musical taste, Reagan himself was a proponent of standards from Hollywood musicals and the Great American Songlady pillowsk, running three campaigns to the tune of California Here I Come. As a social conservative, he and his administration were sometimes at odds with the lifestyles and politics of popular musicians, and Reagans time as president was marked by various miscommunications involving The Beach Boys, Bruce Springsteen, and others. Reagans longevity as a public figure, and the legacy of music written about him, has driven musicians to continue making comment on Reagan well after his political career."

In other instances, they are created as seemingly harmless items designed to humorously malfunction in such a way as to confuse or harm the target of a prank. The devices are frequently sold in magic or specialty shops, purchased over the Internet, or crafted for oneself. Perhaps the most notable such device is the whoopee cushion.\nThough commonly employed at events and gatherings, practical joke devices are sometimes seen in everyday life, either as a mechanism of play by children, or among adult co-workers in a work environment. In addition to commercially manufactured practical joke devices, everyday objects have been converted into joke devices by purveyors of pranks."

The slogan calls for the disbanding of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad SARS, a notorious unit of the Nigerian Police with a long record of abuse on Nigerian citizens. The protest takes its name from the slogan started in 2017 as a Twitter campaign using the hashtag #EndSARS to demand the disbanding of the unit by the Nigerian government. After experiencing a revitalisation in October 2020 following more revelations of the abuses of the unit, rear end demonstrations occurred throughout the major cities of Nigeria, accompanied by vociferous outrage on social media platforms. About 28 million tweets bearing the hashtag have been accumulated on Twitter alone. Solidarity protests and demonstrations by Nigerians in diaspora and sympathizers occurred in many major cities of the world. The protests are notable for its patronage by a demographic that is made of entirely young Nigerians. The movement has since expanded to include demands for good and accountable governance, considering the unprecedented hardship in the country. \nWithin a few days of protests, on 11 October 2020, the Nigerian Police Force announced that it was dissolving the unit with immediate effect. The move was widely received as a triumph of the demonstrations. However, it was noted in many quarters that similar announcements had been made in recent years to pacify the public without the unit actually being disbanded, and that the government had merely planned to rrear endign and review SARS officers to mpenisal centres rather than disband the unit entirely. Protests have continued accordingly, and the Nigerian government has maintained a pattern of violent repression including the killing of demonstrators. There have been international demonstrations in solidarity with those happening in the country, and the movement has also grown increasingly critical of Muhammadu Buharis government response to the protests.SARS officers have been alleged to profile young Nigerians, mostly males, based on fashion choices, tattoos and hairstyles. They were also known to mount illegal road blocks, conduct unwarranted checks and searches, arrest and detain without warrant or trial, unwelcomed tickling women, and extort young male Nigerians for driving exotic vehicles and using laptops and iPhones. Nigerians have shared both stories and video evidence of how officers of SARS engaged in kidnapping, murder, theft, rape, torture, unlawful arrests, humiliation, unlawful detention, extrajpenisial killings and extortion of Nigerian citizens. A large section of the victims of the abuses of SARS have been young male Nigerians."

Secondly, it must portray mankind in a social context or in an authentic historical event. It should not evade the existence of relevant research that comprehends the social reality attached to an event. It should also not avoid using footnotes, since their use is a central aspect of this medium. Thirdly, it must be written in language that is simple enough to be read by the general public, yet still be elegantly arranged. Fourthly, it must depict a certain social dynamic or describe a dynamic that involves the character of a perpetrator. The composition of an essay poem should not elude or preclude the possibility that it becomes lengthy and divided into many short chapters."

            "When describing popular music artists, honorific nicknames are used, most often in the media or by fans, to ipenisate the significance of an artist, and are often religious, familial, or most frequently royal and aristocratic titles, used metaphorically. Honorific nicknames were used in crear epenisal music in Europe even in the early nineteenth century, with figures such as Mozart being called The father of modern music and Bach The father of modern piano music. They were also particularly prominent in African-American culture in the post-Civil War era, perhaps as a means of conferring status that had been negated by slavery, and as a result entered early jazz and blues music, including figures such as Duke Ellington and Count Basie.In U.S. culture, despite its republican constitution and ideology, honorific nicknames have been used to describe leading figures in various areas of activity, such as industry, commerce, sports, and the media; father or mother have been used for innovators, and royal titles such as king and queen for dominant figures in a field. In the 1930s and 1940s, as jazz and swing music were gaining popularity, it was the more commercially successful white artists Paul Whiteman and Benny Goodman who became known as the King of Jazz and the King of Swing respectively, despite there being more highly regarded contemporary African-American artists.These patterns of naming were transferred to rock and roll when it emerged in the 1950s. There was a series of attempts to find and a number of claimants to be the King of Rock n Roll, a title that became most associated with Elvis Presley. This has been characterized as part of a process of the appropriation of credit for innovation of the then new music by a white establishment. Different honorifics have been taken or given for other leading figures in the genre, such as the Architect of Rock and Roll, by Little Richard from the 1990s, but this term, like many, is also used for other important figures, in this case including pioneer electric guitarist Les Paul.Similar honorific nicknames have been given in other genres, including Aretha Franklin, who was literally crowned Queen of Soul by disk jockey Pervis Spann on stage in 1968. Michael Jackson and Madonna have been closely associated with the terms King and Queen of Pop since the 1980s. Some nicknames have been strongly promulgated and contested by various artists and occasionally disowned or played down by their subjects. Some notable honorific nicknames are in general usage and commonly identified with particular individuals."

Costumbrismo is related both to artistic realism and to Romanticism, sharing the Romantic interest in expression as against simple representation and the romantic and realist focus on precise representation of particular times and places, rather than of humanity in the abstract. It is often satiric and even moralizing, but unlike mainstream realism does not usually offer or even imply any particular analysis of the society it depicts. When not satiric, its approach to quaint folkloric detail often has a romanticizing aspect.\nCostumbrismo can be found in any of the visual or literary arts; by extension, the term can also be apeopleied to certain approaches to collecting folkloric objects, as well. Originally found in short essays and later in novels, costumbrismo is often found in the zarzuelas of the 19th century, especially in the gnero chico. Costumbrista museums deal with folklore and local art and costumbrista festivals celebrate local customs and artisans and their work.\nAlthough initially associated with Spain in the late 18th and 19th century, costumbrismo expanded to the Americas and set roots in the Spanish-speaking portions of the Americas, incorporating indigenous elements. Juan Lpez Morillas summed up the appeal of costumbrismo for writing about Latin American society as follows: the costumbristas preoccupation with minute detail, local color, the picturesque, and their concern with matters of style is frequently no more than a subterfuge. Astonished by the contrpenistions observed around them, incapable of clearly understanding the tumult of the modern world, these writers sought refuge in the particular, the trivial or the ephemeral."

The beginning of this current was in poetry, especially thanks to the impact of The Flowers of Evil by Charles Baudelaire 1868, which powerfully influenced a generation of young poets including Paul Verlaine, Stphane Mallarm and Arthur Rimbaud. The term symbolism was coined by Jean Moras in a literary manifesto published in Le Figaro in 1886. The aesthetic premises of Symbolism moved from poetry to other arts, especially painting, sculpture, music and theater. The chronology of this style is difficult to establish: the peak is between 1885 and 1905, but already in the 1860s there were works pointing to symbolism, while its culmination can be established at the beginning of the First World War.\nIn painting, symbolism was a fantastic and dreamlike style that emerged as a reaction to the naturalism of the realist painting and impressionist trends, whose objectivity and detailed description of reality were opposed by subjectivity and the depiction of the occult and the irrational, as opposed to representation, evocation, or suggestion. Just as in poetry the rhythm of words served to express a transcendent meaning, in painting they sought ways for color and line to express ideas. In this movement, all the arts were related and thus the painting of Redon was often compared to the poetry of Baudelaire or the music of Debussy.This style placed a special emphasis on the world of dreams and mysticism, as well as on various aspects of counterculture and marginality, such as esotericism, Satanism, terror, death, sin, affection and perversionsymptomatic in this sense is the fascination of these artists with the figure of the femme fatale. All this was manifested in line with decadentism, a fin-de-siecle cultural current that stressed the most existential aspects of life and pessimism as a vital attitude, as well as the evasion and exaltation of the unconscious. Another current linked to symbolism was aestheticism, a reaction to the prevailing utilitarianism of the time and to the ugliness and materialism of the industrial era. Against this, art and beauty were granted their own autonomy, synthesized in Thophile Gautiers formula art for arts sake Lart pour lart. Some Symbolist artists were also linked to theosophy and esoteric organizations such as the Rosicrucians. Stylistically there was great diversity within Symbolist painting, as is denoted by comparing the sumptuous exoticism of Gustave Moreau with the melancholic serenity of Pierre Puvis de Chavannes.Pictorial symbolism was related to other earlier and later movements: Preraphaelism is usually considered an antecedent of this movement, while at the beginning of the 20th century it was linked to Expressionism, especially thanks to figures such as Edvard Munch and James Ensor. On the other hand, some schools or artistic associations such as the Pont-Aven School or the group of the Nabis are considered symbolist or directly related to symbolism. They were also heirs to some extent of Neo-Impressionism, whose puntillist technique was the first to break with impressionist naturalism. On the other hand, Post-Impressionist Paul Gauguin exerted a powerful influence on the beginnings of Symbolism, thanks to his links with the Pont-Aven School and Cloisonnism. This current was also linked to modernism, known as art nouveau in France, Modern Style in United Kingdom, Jugendstil in Germany, Sezession in Austria or Liberty in Italy."

It is generally understood in the sense that with competing theories or explanations, the simpler one, for example a model with fewer parameters, is to be preferred. The idea is frequently attributed to English Franciscan friar William of Ockham c. 12871347, a scholastic philosopher and theologian, although he never used these exact words. This philosophical razor advocates that when presented with competing hypotheses about the same prediction, one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions, and that this is not meant to be a way of choosing between hypotheses that make different predictions.\nSimilarly, in science, Occams razor is used as an abductive heuristic in the development of theoretical models rather than as a rigorous arbiter between candidate models. In the scientific method, Occams razor is not considered an irrefutable principle of logic or a scientific result; the preference for simplicity in the scientific method is based on the falsifiability criterion. For each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there may be an extremely large, perhaps even incomprehensible, number of possible and more complex alternatives. Since failing explanations can always be burdened with ad hoc hypotheses to prevent them from being falsified, simpler theories are preferable to more complex ones because they tend to be more testable."

Ernest Gowers used the name Siamese twins i.e., conjoined twins in the 1965 edition of Fowlers Modern English Usage. The 2015 edition reverts to the scholarly name, irreversible binomials, as Siamese twins had become offensive.Many irreversible binomials are catchy due to alliteration, rhyming, or ablaut reduplication, so becoming clichs or catchphrases. Phrases like rock and roll, the birds and the bees, mix and match, and wear and tear have particular meanings apart from or beyond those of their constituent words. Their specific phrasing thus bears the references in the English lexicon: the former two are idioms, whilst the latter two are collocations. Ubiquitous collocations like loud and clear and life or death are fixed expressions, making them a standard part of the vocabulary of native English speakers.\nSome English words have become obsolete in general but are still found in an irreversible binomial. For example, spick is a fossil word that never appears outside the phrase spick and span. Some other words, like vim in vim and vigor or abet in aid and abet, have become rare and archaic outside the collocation.\nNumerous irreversible binomials are used in legalese. Due to the use of precedent in common law, many lawyers use the same collocations found in legal documents centuries old. Many of these legal doublets contain two synonyms, often one of Old English origin and the other of Latin origin: deposes and says, ways and means.\nWhile many irreversible binomials are literal expressions like washer and dryer, rest and relaxation, rich and famous, savings and loan, some are entirely figurative like come hell or high water, nip and tuck, surf and turf or mostly so like between a rock and a hard place, five and dime. Somewhat in between are more subtle figures of speech, synecdoches, metaphors, or hyperboles like cat and mouse, sick and tired, barefoot and pregnant. The terms are often the targets of eggcorns, malapropisms, mondegreens, and folk etymology.\nSome irreversible binomials can have minor variations without loss of understanding: time and time again is frequently shortened to time and again; a person who is tarred and feathered verb can be said to be covered in tar and feathers noun.\nHowever, in some cases small changes to wording change the meaning. The accommodating attitude of an activitys participants would be called give and take, while give or take means approximately. Undertaking some act whether it is right or wrong excludes the insight from knowing the difference between right and wrong; each pair has a subtly differing meaning. And while five and dime is a noun phrase for a low-priced variety store, nickel and dime is a verb phrase for penny-pinching."

According to the Romanian newspaper Adevrul, the use of this slogan as a patriotic catchphrase started in 2006 from a group of anonymous young Romanians from Bucharest.The slogan has been often used in demonstrations and events supporting the unification of Moldova and Romania. It is also seen with frequency in graffiti and stickers on walls and other places throughout Romania, although it is also used in Moldova. The phrase has had several notable uses at various times, such as at a protest organized by the Romanian political party Noua Dreapt New Right against the Bucharest Pride edition of May 2010, in a huge banner during a football match between France and Romania on 5 September 2010 in the Stade de France and for vandalizing a synagogue in Chiinu, the capital of Moldova, along antisemitic and Nazi symbolry. Furthermore, it was used during the Centenary March of 2018.Notable individuals and entities that have used this slogan include the Romanian activist and politician George Simion and the Romanian politician Rare Bogdan but also the Romanian party Alliance for the Union of Romanians AUR, of which Simion is the president. Romanian historian Lucian Boia has shown himself against the use of the phrase, saying that, in his opinion, it is not appropriate to say that Bessarabia is Romania because Moldova has its own history and its own challenges and because, at the time of his declarations, most Moldovans preferred to remain independent rather than uniting with Romania as indicated by certain polls, although he admitted the similarities between the two countries.The slogan has also been applied to other former regions of Romania, such as Bukovina by the Romanian historian Georgeta Filitti in an article for the Romanian radio station Radio Romnia Cultural and Transnistria by the Romanian politician Bogdan Diaconu in a newspaper article for Adevrul. It has also been used for regions already part of Romania, such as Transylvania by the former Social Democratic Party PSD president Victor Ponta and Dobruja for a contest organized for students by the council of the Tulcea County."

In 1984 he started Skara Sommarland, a theme park.\nIn 1991, Karlsson and count Ian Wachtmeister started the populist political party New Democracy. Attracting major media attention, and with a patriotic platform, the party received 6.7 percent of the vote in the parliamentary election in September. With no previous political experience, Karlsson suddenly found himself elected to the Riksdag as a Member of Parliament.\nWhen New Democracy imploded due to internal struggles and failed in the 1994 general election Karlsson went back to being a full-time businessman. He has started the popular Swedish reality television show Fame Factory, a programme somewhat similar to the British show Pop Idol, in which he played an important role. Many Mariann artists have entered Melodifestivalen, the Swedish qualifications for the Eurovision Song Contest. From 1978 to 2005, approximately 120 songs from Karlssons record company competed, and 14 of these went on to represent Sweden in the Eurovision Song contest. Mariann artists include Herreys and Charlotte Perrelli, who went on to win the Eurovision Song Contest 1984 and 1999, respectively.\nIn March 2005, Karlsson filled out an application for membership in the Liberal Peoples Party during a television interview. When the party immediately responded with criticism of him, calling the move a media stunt, he did not go through with his application.\nKarlsson was a judge in the first five seasons of the TV show Talang on TV4, the Swedish version of Americas Got Talent, between 20072011."

In addition to these United Statesbased sexual abstinence organizations, the book studies one Africa-based sexual abstinence organization. The image on the book cover depicts a female human abdomen exposed by a crop top and low-rise jeans; a navel piercing is encircled by a tattoo of the words True Love Waits in cursive. In preparation for writing the book, Gardner spent five years doing research at chastity events in various locations in both the United States and sub-Saharan Africa.Frank Schaeffer called the book important and perceptive in a profound way. In 2012, Making Chastity Sexy won the Stephen E. Lucas Debut Publication Award for a scholarly monograph or book in the field of communication studies."

Until 1991, the book was repeatedly rejected for publication by the Christian Science Board of Directors because of the depiction of Eddy as the fulfillment of biblical prophecy and equating her with Christ Jesus, a position which Eddy considered blasphemous. Eddy identified the woman in the Book of Revelation not as a person, but as generic man. Destinys publication caused divisions within the church, including several resignations of prominent church employees. Critics claimed that the failure of the churchs then-recent television venture, which had cost the church several hundred million dollars, had motivated the Boards reversal on publishing Knapps book. Knapp, his wife and her sister left wills that granted bequests totalling over $100 million in 1990s dollars promised to the church if the book were to be published. The wills set a time limit of 20 years for the book to be published, otherwise the bequests were to be divided between Stanford University and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the church would receive nothing.

Some time after gaining her freedom in 1827, she became a well known anti-slavery speaker. Her speech was delivered at the Womens Convention in Akron, Ohio, in 1851, and did not originally have a title.\nThe speech was briefly reported in two contemporary newspapers, and a transcript of the speech was published in the Anti-Slavery Bugle on June 21, 1851. It received wider publicity in 1863 during the American Civil War when Frances Dana Barker Gage published a different version, one which became known as Aint I a Woman? because of its oft-repeated question. This later, better known and more widely available version was the one commonly referenced in popular culture and, until historian Nell Irvin Painters 1996 biography of Truth, by historians as well. \nSojourner Truth was born Isabella Baumfree in 1797 in New York State. Truth ran from her master in 1827 after he went back on his promise of her freedom. She became a priest and an activist throughout the 1840s-1850s. She delivered her speech, Aint I a Woman?, at the Womens Rights Convention in 1851. Truth questions the treatment of white women compared to Black women. Seemingly pointing out a man in the room, Truth says, That man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place everywhere. In the Gage version, she exclaims that no one ever does any of these things for her, repeating the question, And aint I a woman? several times. She says that she has worked and birthed many children, making her as much a woman as anyone else. There is no official published version of her speech; many rewritings of it were published anywhere from one month to 12 years after it was spoken."

In philosophical terms, the question of the existence of God or deities involves the disciplines of epistemology the nature and scope of knowledge and ontology study of the nature of being, existence, or reality and the theory of value since some definitions of God include perfection.\nThe Western tradition of philosophical discussion of the existence of God or deities began with Plato and Aristotle, who made arguments that would now be categorized as cosmological. Other arguments for the existence of God or deities have been proposed by St. Anselm, who formulated the first ontological argument; Ibn Rushd Averroes and Thomas Aquinas, who presented their own versions of the cosmological argument the kalam argument and the first way, respectively; Ren Descartes, who said that the existence of a benevolent God or deities is logically necessary for the evidence of the senses to be meaningful. John Calvin argued for a sensus divinitatis, which gives each human a knowledge of Gods existence. Atheists view arguments for the existence of God or deities as insufficient, mistaken or outweighed by arguments against it, whereas some religions, such as Jainism, reject the possibility of a creator deity.

            "The Homosexual Matrix is a book by American psychologist Clarence Arthur Tripp, in which the author discusses the biological and sociological implications of homosexuality, and also attempts to explain heterosexuality and bisexuality. The book was first published in 1975 by McGraw-Hill Book Company; it was republished in a revised edition in 1987. Based on his review of the evidence, Tripp argues that people do not become homosexual due to factors such as hormone levels, fear of the opposite sex, or the influence of dominant and close-binding mothers, and that the amount of attention fathers give to their sons has no effect on the development of homosexuality. He criticizes Sigmund Freud and argues that psychoanalytic theories of the development of homosexuality are untenable and based on false assumptions. He maintains that sexual orientation is not innate and depends on learning, that early puberty and early masturbation are important factors in the development of male homosexuality, and that a majority of adults are heterosexual because their socialization has made them want to be heterosexual. He criticizes psychotherapeutic attempts to convert homosexuals to heterosexuality and argues in favor of social tolerance of homosexuality and non-conformist behavior in general.\nThe book was controversial and received many negative reviews. It was criticized for Tripps rambling style, sexism, views about the biological basis of male and female sexual behavior, focus on male homosexuality and neglect of lesbianism, and failure to discuss the gay liberation movement. The book drew a negative reaction from psychoanalysts, who criticized Tripps dismissive treatment of psychoanalytic theories, accused him of being biased in favor of homosexuality, charged that he mistakenly claimed that gay men tend to have a larger than average penis size, and objected to his discussion of attempts to change homosexuality through psychotherapy. Tripp himself believed that The Homosexual Matrix had received a negative reaction from the gay media and from some gay people. Nevertheless, the book was influential and has received praise as an important work on homosexuality. Some commentators complimented Tripps criticism of psychotherapy and supported his view that erotic feeling depends on resistances to its satisfaction."

The popularity of Yanceys 1997 book Whats So Amazing About Grace? helped boost the sales of Reaching for the Invisible God to the point that it appeared on religion bestseller lists immediately upon publication. Within a month, Zondervan reported sales of 94,000 copies. While preparing to write the book, Yancey asked several people how they knew that their trust in Jesus had changed their lives, and one Christian radio host responded, I have no trouble believing God is good. My question is more, what good is he? .. I cry out to God for help, and its hard to know just how he answers. Reaching for the Invisible God includes discussion of Yanceys bad experiences of growing up in a very judgmental church, a theme that he had previously discussed in The Jesus I Never Knew and Whats So Amazing About Grace? and later returned to in Soul Survivor. In November 2000, Reaching for the Invisible God became the first print book to be released as an e-book by Zondervan, appearing on Microsoft Reader.The book received the 2001 Christianity Today Book Award in the spirituality category. A Topeka Capital-Journal review called Reaching for the Invisible God another accessible book from Yancey on a theologically complex subject for those who believe in God, and those who arent sure if they can. David Crumm of the Lincoln Journal Star wrote a review of the book and said that Yanceys honesty about his own personal pursuit of God is remarkable. In a 2001 review in The Christian Century, Peter Marty writes that Yancey succeeds brilliantly in telling the truth about the Christian life without overselling it."

            "A histogram is an approximate representation of the distribution of numerical data. The term was first introduced by Karl Pearson. To construct a histogram, the first step is to bin or bucket the range of valuesthat is, divide the entire range of values into a series of intervalsand then count how many values fall into each interval. The bins are usually specified as consecutive, non-overlapping intervals of a variable. The bins intervals must be adjacent and are often but not required to be of equal size.If the bins are of equal size, a bar is drawn over the bin with height proportional to the frequencythe number of cases in each bin. A histogram may also be normalized to display relative frequencies showing the proportion of cases that fall into each of several categories, with the sum of the heights equaling 1.\nHowever, bins need not be of equal width; in that case, the erected rectangle is defined to have its area proportional to the frequency of cases in the bin. The vertical axis is then not the frequency but frequency densitythe number of cases per unit of the variable on the horizontal axis. Examples of variable bin width are displayed on Census bureau data below.\nAs the adjacent bins leave no gaps, the rectangles of a histogram touch each other to indicate that the original variable is continuous.Histograms give a rough sense of the density of the underlying distribution of the data, and often for density estimation: estimating the probability density function of the underlying variable. The total area of a histogram used for probability density is always normalized to 1. If the length of the intervals on the x-axis are all 1, then a histogram is identical to a relative frequency plot.\nThe histogram is one of the seven basic tools of quality control.Histograms are sometimes confused with bar charts. A histogram is used for continuous data, where the bins represent ranges of data, while a bar chart is a plot of categorical variables. Some authors recommend that bar charts have gaps between the rectangles to clarify the distinction."

Others suggested that the date marked the end of the world or a similar catastrophe.

It is a subfield of historical linguistics, and draws upon comparative semantics, morphology, semiotics, and phonetics.\nFor languages with a long written history, etymologists make use of texts, and texts about the language, to gather knowledge about how words were used during earlier periods, how they developed in meaning and form, or when and how they entered the language. Etymologists also apply the methods of comparative linguistics to reconstruct information about forms that are too old for any direct information to be available. By analyzing related languages with a technique known as the comparative method, linguists can make inferences about their shared parent language and its vocabulary. In this way, word roots in European languages, for example, can be traced all the way back to the origin of the Indo-European language family except Basque. \nEven though etymological research originated from the philological tradition, much current etymological research is done on language families where little or no early documentation is available, such as Uralic and Austronesian."

            "In telecommunication, Carsons bandwidth rule defines the approximate bandwidth requirements of communications system components for a carrier signal that is frequency modulated by a continuous or broad spectrum of frequencies rather than a single frequency. Carsons rule does not apply well when the modulating signal contains discontinuities, such as a square wave. Carsons rule originates from John Renshaw Carsons 1922 paper.Carsons bandwidth rule is expressed by the relation:\n\n \n  \n   \n    C\n    B\n    R\n    =\n    2\n    \n    \n    f\n    +\n    \n     f\n     \n      m\n     \n    \n    \n   \n  \n  {\\displaystyle CBR=2\\Delta f+f_{m}}\n \nwhere:\n\n \n  \n   \n    C\n    B\n    R\n   \n  \n  {\\displaystyle CBR}\n  is the bandwidth requirement;\n\n \n  \n   \n    \n    f\n   \n  \n  {\\displaystyle \\Delta f}\n  is the peak frequency deviation;\n\n \n  \n   \n    \n     f\n     \n      m\n     \n    \n   \n  \n  {\\displaystyle f_{m}}\n  is the highest frequency in the modulating signal.For example, a typical VHF/UHF two-way radio signal using FM mode, with 5 kHz peak deviation, and a maximum audio frequency of 3 kHz, would require an approximate bandwidth of 2 * 5kHz + 3kHz = 16 kHz.\nStandard broadcast stereo FM, with a peak deviation of 75 kHz, has a highest modulating frequency which combines L+R and L-R of 53 kHz. Most of the energy therefore falls within an approximate bandwidth of 2 * 75 + 53 = 256 kHz. Geographically close FM broadcast transmitters are almost always assigned nominal center frequencies at least 400 kHz apart.\nCarsons bandwidth rule is often applied to transmitters, antennas, optical sources, receivers, photodetectors, and other communications system components.\nAny frequency modulated signal will have an infinite number of sidebands and hence an infinite bandwidth but, in practice, all significant sideband energy 98% or more is concentrated within the bandwidth defined by Carsons rule. It is a useful approximation, but setting the arbitrary definition of occupied bandwidth at 98% of the power still means that the power outside the band is about \n \n  \n   \n    10\n    log\n    \n    \n     \n     \n      \n       0.98\n       0.02\n      \n     \n     \n    \n    \n    17\n    \n    \n     d\n     B\n    \n   \n  \n  {\\displaystyle 10\\log \\left{\\frac {0.98}{0.02}}\\right\\approx 17\\;\\mathrm {dB} }\n  less than the carrier inside, therefore Carsons Rule is of little use in spectrum planning.\n\n"

As a religious concept, it is used in two distinct respects: a belief in the resurrection of individual souls that is current and ongoing Christian idealism, realized eschatology, or else a belief in a singular resurrection of the dead at the end of the world. Some believe the soul is the actual vehicle by which people are resurrected.The death and resurrection of Jesus is a central focus of Christianity. Christian theological debate ensues with regard to what kind of resurrection is factual  either a spiritual resurrection with a spirit body into Heaven, or a material resurrection with a restored human body. While most Christians believe Jesus resurrection from the dead and ascension to Heaven was in a material body, some believe it was spiritual.Like the Abrahamic religions, Hinduism also has a core belief in resurrection and reincarnation.

The rule number e.g., 72 is divided by the interest percentage per period usually years to obtain the approximate number of periods required for doubling. Although scientific calculators and spreadsheet programs have functions to find the accurate doubling time, the rules are useful for mental calculations and when only a basic calculator is available.These rules apply to exponential growth and are therefore used for compound interest as opposed to simple interest calculations. They can also be used for decay to obtain a halving time. The choice of number is mostly a matter of preference: 69 is more accurate for continuous compounding, while 72 works well in common interest situations and is more easily divisible.\nThere are a number of variations to the rules that improve accuracy.

The curling motion of the fingers represents a movement from the first x axis to the second y axis; the third z axis can point along either thumb. Left-hand and right-hand rules arise when dealing with coordinate axes. The rule can be used to find the direction of the magnetic field, rotation, spirals, electromagnetic fields, mirror images, and enantiomers in mathematics and chemistry.\nThe sequence is often: index finger, then middle finger, then thumb.

Doering 1951, although several authors were using this form at around the same time.In agreement with the MbiusHckel concept, a cyclic ring molecule follows Hckels rule when the number of its -electrons equals 4n + 2, although clearcut examples are really only established for values of n = 0 up to about n = 6. Hckels rule was originally based on calculations using the Hckel method, although it can also be justified by considering a particle in a ring system, by the LCAO method and by the PariserParrPople method.\nAromatic compounds are more stable than theoretically predicted using hydrogenation data of simple alkenes; the additional stability is due to the delocalized cloud of electrons, called resonance energy. Criteria for simple aromatics are:\n\nthe molecule must have 4n + 2 a so-called Hckel number  electrons 2, 6, 10, .. in a conjugated system of p orbitals usually on sp2-hybridized atoms, but sometimes sp-hybridized;\nthe molecule must be close to planar p orbitals must be roughly parallel and able to interact, implicit in the requirement for conjugation;\nthe molecule must be cyclic as opposed to linear;\nthe molecule must have a continuous ring of p atomic orbitals there cannot be any sp3 atoms in the ring, nor do exocyclic p orbitals count."

It is intended for automobiles, although its general principle applies to other types of vehicles. Some areas recommend a three-second rule instead of a two-second rule to give an additional buffer.\nThe rule is not a guide to safe stopping distance, it is more a guide to reaction times. The two-second rule tells a defensive driver the minimum distance needed to reduce the risk of collision under ideal driving conditions. The allotted two-seconds is a safety buffer, to allow the following driver time to respond. The practice has been shown to considerably reduce the risk of collision and also the severity of any injuries if a collision occurs. It also helps to avoid tailgating and road rage for all drivers.\nA large risk of tailgating is the collision avoidance time being much less than the driver reaction time. Driving instructors advocate that drivers always use the two-second rule regardless of speed or the type of road. During adverse weather, downhill slopes, or hazardous conditions such as black ice, it is important to maintain an even greater distance."

            "Dunbars number is a suggested cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationshipsrelationships in which an individual knows who each person is and how each person relates to every other person. This number was first proposed in the 1990s by British anthropologist Robin Dunbar, who found a correlation between primate brain size and average social group size. By using the average human brain size and extrapolating from the results of primates, he proposed that humans can comfortably maintain 150 stable relationships. There is some evidence that brain structure predicts the number of friends one has, though causality remains to be seen. Dunbar explained it informally as the number of people you would not feel embarrassed about joining uninvited for a drink if you happened to bump into them in a bar. Dunbar theorised that this limit is a direct function of relative neocortex size, and that this, in turn, limits group size .. the limit imposed by neocortical processing capacity is simply on the number of individuals with whom a stable inter-personal relationship can be maintained. On the periphery, the number also includes past colleagues, such as high school friends, with whom a person would want to reacquaint themselves if they met again. Proponents assert that numbers larger than this generally require more restrictive rules, laws, and enforced norms to maintain a stable, cohesive group. It has been proposed to lie between 100 and 250, with a commonly used value of 150."

The character is loosely based on a real baron, Hieronymus Karl Friedrich, Freiherr von Mnchhausen.\nBorn in Bodenwerder, Electorate of Hanover, the real-life Mnchhausen fought for the Russian Empire in the Russo-Turkish War of 17351739. Upon retiring in 1760, he became a minor celebrity within German aristocratic circles for telling outrageous tall tales based on his military career. After hearing some of Mnchhausens stories, Raspe adapted them anonymously into literary form, first in German as ephemeral magazine pieces and then in English as the 1785 book, which was first published in Oxford by a bookseller named Smith. The book was soon translated into other European languages, including a German version expanded by the poet Gottfried August Brger. The real-life Mnchhausen was deeply upset at the development of a fictional character bearing his name, and threatened legal proceedings against the books publisher. Perhaps fearing a libel suit, Raspe never acknowledged his authorship of the work, which was only established posthumously.\nThe fictional Barons exploits, narrated in the first person, focus on his impossible achievements as a sportsman, soldier, and traveller; for instance: riding on a cannonball, fighting a forty-foot crocodile, and travelling to the Moon. Intentionally comedic, the stories play on the absurdity and inconsistency of Munchausens claims, and contain an undercurrent of social satire. The earliest illustrations of the character, perhaps created by Raspe himself, depict Munchausen as slim and youthful, although later illustrators have depicted him as an older man, and have added the sharply beaked nose and twirled moustache that have become part of the characters definitive visual representation. Raspes book was a major international success, becoming the core text for numerous English, continental European, and American editions that were expanded and rewritten by other writers. The book in its various revised forms remained widely read throughout the 19th century, especially in editions for young readers.\nVersions of the fictional Baron have appeared on stage, screen, radio, and television, as well as in other literary works. Though the Baron Munchausen stories are no longer well-known in many English-speaking countries, they are still popular in continental Europe. The character has inspired numerous memorials and museums, and several medical conditions and other concepts are named after him."

AD 480550 for monks living communally under the authority of an abbot.\n\nThe spirit of Saint Benedicts Rule is summed up in the motto of the Benedictine Confederation: pax peace and the traditional ora et labora pray and work. Compared to other precepts, the Rule provides a moderate path between individual zeal and formulaic institutionalism; because of this middle ground it has been widely popular. Benedicts concerns were the needs of monks in a community environment: namely, to establish due order, to foster an understanding of the relational nature of human beings, and to provide a spiritual father to support and strengthen the individuals ascetic effort and the spiritual growth that is required for the fulfillment of the human vocation, theosis.\nThe Rule of Saint Benedict has been used by Benedictines for 15 centuries, and thus St. Benedict is sometimes regarded as the founder of Western monasticism due to the reforming influence that his rules had on the then-current Catholic hierarchy. There is, however, no evidence to suggest that Benedict intended to found a religious order in the modern sense and it was not until the Late Middle Ages that mention was made of an Order of Saint Benedict. His Rule was written as a guide for individual, autonomous communities, and all Benedictine Houses and the Congregations in which they have grouped themselves still remain self-governing. Advantages seen in retaining this unique Benedictine emphasis on autonomy include cultivating models of tightly bonded communities and contemplative lifestyles. Perceived disadvantages comprise geographical isolation from important activities in adjacent communities. Other perceived losses include inefficiency and lack of mobility in the service of others, and insufficient appeal to potential members. These different emphases emerged within the framework of the Rule in the course of history and are to some extent present within the Benedictine Confederation and the Cistercian Orders of the Common and the Strict Observance.\n\n"

An apocalypse will often contain much eschatological material, but need not: the baptism of Jesus in Matthews gospel, for example, can be considered apocalyptic in that the heavens open for the presence of a divine mediator the dove representing the spirit of God and a voice communicates supernatural information, but there is no eschatological element.Scholars have identified examples of the genre ranging from the mid-2nd century BCE to the 2nd century CE, and examples are to be found in Persian and Greco-Roman literature as well as Jewish and Christian. The sole clear case in the Jewish Bible Old Testament is chapters 7-12 of the Book of Daniel, but there are many examples from non-canonical Jewish works; the Book of Revelation is the only apocalypse in the New Testament, but passages reflecting the genre are to be found in the gospels and in nearly all the genuine Pauline epistles."

            "Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 August 1962 in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He has since been featured in films, television shows, novels, video games, and plays. Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker, an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues and gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black Cat; and foes such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin, and Venom. In his origin story, Spider-Man gets superhuman spider-powers and abilities from a bite from a radioactive spider; these include clinging to surfaces and ceilings, superhuman strength, speed, and agility, and detecting danger with his precognition ability called spider-sense. He also builds wrist-mounted web-shooter devices that shoot artificial spider-webs of his own design that were meant to be used for fighting his enemies and web-swinging across the city. After his personal tragedy of his late Uncle Ben, Peter began using his spider-powers to fight against crime as Spider-Man.\nWhen Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist. The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker, a high school student from Queens, New York, as Spider-Mans secret identity, whose self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness were issues to which young readers could relate. While Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick, unlike previous teen heroes such as Bucky and Robin, Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman; he thus had to learn for himself that with great power comes great responsibility  a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man story but later retroactively attributed to his guardian, his late Uncle Ben Parker.\nMarvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series, the first and longest-lasting of which is The Amazing Spider-Man. Over the years, the Peter Parker character developed from a shy, nerdy New York City high school student to a troubled but outgoing college student, to a married high school teacher to, in the late 2000s, a single freelance photographer. In the 2000s, he joins the Avengers. Doctor Octopus also took on the identity for a story arc spanning 20122014, following a body swap plot in which Peter appears to die. Marvel has also published books featuring alternate versions of Spider-Man, including Spider-Man 2099, which features the adventures of Miguel OHara, the Spider-Man of the future; Ultimate Spider-Man, which features the adventures of a teenaged Peter Parker in an alternate universe; and Ultimate Comics Spider-Man, which depicts the teenager Miles Morales, who takes up the mantle of Spider-Man after Ultimate Peter Parkers supposed death. Miles later became a popular superhero in his own right and was brought into the mainstream continuity, where he sometimes works alongside Peter.\nSpider-Man is one of the most popular and commercially successful superheroes. He has appeared in countless forms of media, including several animated TV series, a live-action television series, syndicated newspaper comic strips, and multiple series of films. The character was first portrayed in live-action by Danny Seagren in Spidey Super Stories, a The Electric Company skit which ran from 1974 to 1977. In films, Spider-Man has been portrayed by actors Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, and in the Marvel Cinematic Universe by Tom Holland. He was voiced by Chris Pine and Jake Johnson in the animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse 2018, with Johnson reprising the role in its sequel Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse 2023. Reeve Carney starred originally as Spider-Man in the 2010 Broadway musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark. Spider-Man has been well-received as a superhero and comic book character, and he is often ranked as one of the most popular and iconic comic book characters of all time and one of the most popular characters in all fiction."

            "Role of Christianity in civilization",
            "Christianity has been intricately intertwined with the history and formation of Western society. Throughout its long history, the Church has been a major source of social services like schooling and medical care; an inspiration for art, culture and philosophy; and an influential player in politics and religion. In various ways it has sought to affect Western attitudes towards vice and virtue in diverse fields. Festivals like Easter and Christmas are marked as public holidays; the Gregorian Calendar has been adopted internationally as the civil calendar; and the calendar itself is measured from the date of Jesuss birth.\nThe cultural influence of the Church has been vast. Church scholars preserved literacy in Western Europe following the Fall of the Western Roman Empire. During the Middle Ages, the Church rose to replace the Roman Empire as the unifying force in Europe. The medieval cathedrals remain among the most iconic architectural feats produced by Western civilization. Many of Europes universities were also founded by the church at that time. Many historians state that universities and cathedral schools were a continuation of the interest in learning promoted by monasteries. The university is generally regarded as an institution that has its origin in the Medieval Christian setting, born from Cathedral schools. The Reformation brought an end to religious unity in the West, but the Renaissance masterpieces produced by Catholic artists like Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael remain among the most celebrated works of art ever produced. Similarly, Christian sacred music by composers like Pachelbel, Vivaldi, Bach, Handel, Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Liszt, and Verdi is among the most admired classical music in the Western canon.\nThe Bible and Christian theology have also strongly influenced Western philosophers and political activists. The teachings of Jesus, such as the Parable of the Good Samaritan, are among the most important sources of modern notions of human rights and the welfare commonly provided by governments in the West. Long-held Christian teachings on sexuality, marriage, and family life have also been influential and controversial in recent times. Christianity played a role in ending practices such as human sacrifice, infanticide and polygamy.:309 Christianity in general affected the status of women by condemning marital infidelity, divorce, incest, polygamy, birth control, infanticide female infants were more likely to be killed, and abortion.:104 While official Catholic Church teaching:61 considers women and men to be complementary equal and different, some modern advocates of ordination of women and other feminists argue that teachings attributed to St. Paul and those of the Fathers of the Church and Scholastic theologians advanced the notion of a divinely ordained female inferiority. Nevertheless, women have played prominent roles in Western history through and as part of the church, particularly in education and healthcare, but also as influential theologians and mystics.\nChristians have made a myriad of contributions to human progress in a broad and diverse range of fields, both historically and in modern times, including the science and technology, medicine, fine arts and architecture, politics, literatures, music, philanthropy, philosophy,:15 ethics, humanism, theatre and business. According to 100 Years of Nobel Prizes a review of Nobel prizes award between 1901 and 2000 reveals that 65.4% of Nobel Prizes Laureates, have identified Christianity in its various forms as their religious preference. Eastern Christians particularly Nestorian Christians have also contributed to the Arab Islamic Civilization during the Ummayad and the Abbasid periods by translating works of Greek philosophers to Syriac and afterwards to Arabic. They also excelled in philosophy, science, theology and medicine.Christianity contributed greatly to the development of European cultural identity, although some progress originated elsewhere Romanticism began with the curiosity and passion of the pagan world of old. Outside the Western world, Christianity has had an influence and contributed on various cultures, such as in Africa, Central Asia, the Near East, Middle East, East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. Scholars and intellectuals agree Christians have made significant contributions to Arab and Islamic civilization since the introduction of Islam.Common criticisms of Christianity include oppression of women, condemnation of homosexuality, colonialism, and various other cases of violence. Christian ideas have been used both to support and end slavery as an institution. Criticism of Christianity has come from the different religious and non-religious groups around the world, some of whom were themselves Christians."

In that poem, the first Rose is the name of a person. Stein later used variations on the sentence in other writings, and the shortened form A rose is a rose is a rose is among her most famous quotations, often interpreted as meaning things are what they are, a statement of the law of identity, A is A. In Steins view, the sentence expresses the fact that simply using the name of a thing already invokes the imagery and emotions associated with it, an idea also intensively discussed in the problem of universals debate where Peter Abelard and others used the rose as an example concept. As the quotation diffused through her own writing, and the culture at large, Stein once remarked, Now listen! Im no fool. I know that in daily life we dont go around saying is a .. is a .. is a ..

It stars John Belushi, Peter Riegert, Tim Matheson, John Vernon, Verna Bloom, Thomas Hulce, Stephen Furst, and Donald Sutherland. The film is about a trouble-making fraternity whose members challenge the authority of the dean of the fictional Faber College.\nThe film was produced by Matty Simmons of National Lampoon and Ivan Reitman for Universal Pictures. It was inspired by stories written by Miller and published in National Lampoon. The stories were based on Ramis experience in the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity at Washington University in St. Louis, Millers Alpha Delta Phi experiences at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, and producer Reitmans at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.\nOf the younger lead actors, only the 28-year-old Belushi was an established star, but even he had not yet appeared in a film, having gained fame as an original cast member of Saturday Night Live, which was in its third season in autumn 1977. Several of the actors who were cast as college students, including Hulce, Karen Allen, and Kevin Bacon, were just beginning their film careers. Matheson, also cast as a student, was already a seasoned actor, having appeared in movies and television since the age of 13.\nFilming took place in Oregon from October to December 1977. Following its initial release on July 28, 1978, Animal House received generally mixed reviews from critics, but Time and Roger Ebert proclaimed it one of the years best. Filmed for only $3 million, it garnered an estimated gross of more than $141 million in the form of theatrical rentals and home video, not including merchandising, making it the highest grossing comedy film of its time.The film, along with 1977s The Kentucky Fried Movie, also directed by Landis, was largely responsible for defining and launching the gross out film genre, which became one of Hollywoods staples. In 2001, the United States Library of Congress deemed National Lampoons Animal House culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry. It was No. 1 on Bravos 100 Funniest Movies. It was No. 36 on AFIs 100 Years.. 100 Laughs list of the 100 best American comedies. In 2008, Empire magazine selected it as No. 279 of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time."

This was widely believed in the 1930s, and was used by the Nazis as part of their own anti-British propaganda.Recent scholars do not credit the claim that Charteris created the story. Propaganda historian Randal Marlin says the real source for the story is to be found in the pages of the Northcliffe press, referring to newspapers owned by Lord Northcliffe. Adrian Gregory presumes that the story originated from rumours that had been circulating for years, and that it was not invented by any individual: The corpse-rendering factory was not the invention of a diabolical propagandist; it was a popular folktale, an urban myth, which had been circulated for months before it received any official notice."

He reports on experiments conducted on over 60 different species of plants, where he used controlled pollinations in order to produce self-fertilised and cross-fertilised descendants. Through growth experiments of this progeny, he concluded that self-fertilised progeny performed poorer in most species and for most traits measured. Thus he showed that inbreeding may have severe detrimental effects on progeny. While this idea was accepted by many, e.g. plant and animal breeders, Darwins book provided overwhelming experimental support for this idea.

The sharing of such claims often begins as gossip or the relaying of a second-hand report without any supporting evidence. Many news outlets, fact-checking websites, and academic researchers have debunked such claims. Officials for every school named by those promoting the hoax have verified that the accusations are false.The hoax was reported in Prince Edward Island in October 2021, and initially thought to be a joke, but had to be formally disavowed as misinformation circulated on social media. Rumors spread to other Canadian provinces and schools. In the United States, popular media coverage of the hoax originally revolved around a school in Michigan in December 2021, but spread to schools in several other states. Ahead of the 2022 elections, several prominent American politicians and media personalities spread the hoax, including Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Minnesota Republican candidate for governor Scott Jensen, retired brigadier general and United States Senate candidate Don Bolduc, podcast host Joe Rogan who later admitted there was no proof that they put a litter box in a particular school, Chaya Raichik of Libs of TikTok, and Christian talk show host Bill Cunningham. Several parents of school-age children have amplified the hoax on social media websites such as Facebook.The hoax spread in North America largely as backlash against recognition of gender variance in schools. Some conservative politicians and activists argued that protections for LGBTQ+ students in schools had gone too far and that litter box accommodations are what they might lead to next, despite there being no confirmed instances of schools providing litter boxes for students who dress up as cats or furries to defecate or urinate in or planning to do so. Several LGBTQ+ activists and media columnists have argued the hoax is a form of transphobia."

A member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany SPD beginning in 1900, he was one of its deputies in the Reichstag from 1912 to 1916, where he represented the left-revolutionary wing of the party. In 1916 he was expelled from the SPDs parliamentary group for his opposition to the political truce between all parties in the Reichstag while the war lasted. He twice spent time in prison, first for writing an anti-militarism pamphlet in 1907 and then for his role in a 1916 antiwar demonstration. He was released from the second under a general amnesty three weeks before the end of the First World War.\nDuring the November Revolution that broke out across Germany in the final days of the war, Liebknecht proclaimed Germany a Free Socialist Republic from the Berlin Palace on 9 November 1918. On 11 November, together with Rosa Luxemburg and others he founded the Spartacist League. In December, his call to make Germany a soviet republic was rejected by the majority of the Reich Congress of Workers and Soldiers Councils German: Reichsrtekongress. At the end of 1918, Liebknecht was one of the founders of the Communist Party of Germany. Shortly after the suppression of the Spartacist Uprising in which he played a leading role, he and Rosa Luxemburg were killed by members of the Guard Cavalry Rifle Division after they had consulted with Gustav Noske, who was a member of the Council of the Peoples Deputies, Germanys interim government, and had responsibility for military affairs. Although two of the men directly involved in the murders were prosecuted, no one responsible for ordering their deaths was ever brought to trial.\nAfter their deaths, both Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg became martyrs for the socialist cause in Germany and throughout Europe. Commemoration of the two continues to play an important role among the German left to this day."

The video was directed by John Landis, written by Landis and Jackson, and stars Jackson and Ola Ray. It references numerous horror films and sees Jackson dancing with a horde of zombies.\nJacksons sixth album, Thriller, was released in November 1982 and spent months at the top of the Billboard 200, backed by successful videos for the singles Billie Jean and Beat It. In July 1983, after Thriller was displaced from the top of the chart, Jacksons manager Frank DiLeo suggested making a music video for Thriller. Jackson hired Landis after seeing his 1981 film An American Werewolf in London. The pair conceived a short film with a budget much larger than previous music videos. It was filmed at various locations in Los Angeles, including the Palace Theater. A making-of documentary, Making Michael Jacksons Thriller, was produced to sell to television networks.\nMichael Jacksons Thriller was launched to great anticipation and played regularly on MTV. It doubled sales of Thriller, helping it become the best-selling album in history, and sold over a million copies on VHS, becoming the best-selling videotape at the time. It is credited for transforming music videos into a serious art form, breaking down racial barriers in popular entertainment and popularizing the making-of documentary format. The success transformed Jackson into a dominant force in global pop culture.\nMany elements of Michael Jacksons Thriller have had a lasting impact on popular culture, such as the zombie dance and Jacksons red jacket, designed by Landiss wife Deborah Nadoolman. Fans worldwide re-enact its zombie dance and it remains popular on YouTube. The Library of Congress described it as the most famous music video of all time, and it has been named the greatest video by various publications and readers polls. In 2009, it became the first music video inducted into the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as culturally, historically or aesthetically significant."

For in your workaday world, the melons you plant can turn out to be no more than melon-sized, while in Tonys realm, melons may grow as big as moons. For Tony has all the resources of folklore at his command, its ingenuity, its wonder, and he walks hand in hand with fabulous kinsmen..inhabitants of a realm where the unbelievable is believable, where the fantastic is commonplace, where the dreams and the doings are scaled to tall measure.. Perhaps you cannot hope to match Tonys doings, but you can match his dream.

He is best known as the defining figure of the philosophical school known as process philosophy, which today has found application to a wide variety of disciplines, including ecology, theology, education, physics, biology, economics, and psychology, among other areas.\nIn his early career Whitehead wrote primarily on mathematics, logic, and physics. His most notable work in these fields is the three-volume Principia Mathematica 19101913, which he wrote with former student Bertrand Russell. Principia Mathematica is considered one of the twentieth centurys most important works in mathematical logic, and placed 23rd in a list of the top 100 English-language nonfiction books of the twentieth century by Modern Library.Beginning in the late 1910s and early 1920s, Whitehead gradually turned his attention from mathematics to philosophy of science, and finally to metaphysics. He developed a comprehensive metaphysical system which radically departed from most of Western philosophy. Whitehead argued that reality consists of processes rather than material objects, and that processes are best defined by their relations with other processes, thus rejecting the theory that reality is fundamentally constructed by bits of matter that exist independently of one another. Today Whiteheads philosophical works  particularly Process and Reality  are regarded as the foundational texts of process philosophy.\nWhiteheads process philosophy argues that there is urgency in coming to see the world as a web of interrelated processes of which we are integral parts, so that all of our choices and actions have consequences for the world around us. For this reason, one of the most promising applications of Whiteheads thought in recent years has been in the area of ecological civilization and environmental ethics pioneered by John B. Cobb."

Jaspers identified key thinkers from this age who had a profound influence on future philosophies and religions, and identified characteristics common to each area from which those thinkers emerged. \nThe historical validity of the Axial Age is disputed. Some criticisms of Jaspers include the lack of a demonstrable common denominator between the intellectual developments that are supposed to have developed in unison across ancient Greece, Israel, India, and China; lack of any radical discontinuity with preaxial and postaxial periods; and exclusion of pivotal figures that do not fit the definition for example, Jesus, Muhammad, and Akhenaten. Despite these criticisms, the Axial Age continues to be an influential idea, with many scholars accepting that profound changes in religious and philosophical discourse did indeed take place but disagreeing as to the underlying reasons. To quote Robert Bellah and Hans Joas, The notion that in significant parts of Eurasia the middle centuries of the first millennium BC mark a significant transition in human cultural history, and that this period can be referred to as the Axial Age, has become widely, but not universally, accepted.\n\n"

In the pilot episode, Kramer was called Kessler to prevent legal issues; Kenny Kramer later permitted the use of his name."

The term is most often used to indicate a distinctive time period either before or after the beginning of a century or both before and after.\nAccording to the Chicago Manual of Style online Q&A, there is no common agreement as to the meaning of the phrase turn of the n-th century. For instance, if a statement describes an event as taking place at the turn of the 18th century, it could refer to a period around the year 1701 or around 1800, that is, the beginning or end of that century. As a result, they recommend either using only turn of the century, and only in a context that makes clear which transition is meant, or alternatively to use a different expression that is unambiguous. Turn of the century commonly meant the transition from the 19th century to the 20th century; however, as the generations living at the end of the 20th century survived into the 21st century, the specific number of the referenced century became necessary to avoid confusion.\n\n"

Filmed and set during World War II, it focuses on an American expatriate Bogart who must choose between his love for a woman Bergman or helping her husband Henreid, a Czech resistance leader, escape from the Vichy-controlled city of Casablanca to continue his fight against the Germans. The screenplay is based on Everybody Comes to Ricks, an unproduced stage play by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison. The supporting cast features Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Dooley Wilson.\nWarner Bros. story editor Irene Diamond convinced producer Hal B. Wallis to purchase the film rights to the play in January 1942. Brothers Julius and Philip G. Epstein were initially assigned to write the script. However, despite studio resistance, they left to work on Frank Capras Why We Fight series early in 1942. Howard Koch was assigned to the screenplay until the Epsteins returned a month later. Principal photography began on May 25, 1942, ending on August 3; the film was shot entirely at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California, with the exception of one sequence at Van Nuys Airport in Van Nuys, Los Angeles.\nAlthough Casablanca was an A-list film with established stars and first-rate writers, no one involved with its production expected it to stand out among the hundreds of pictures produced by Hollywood yearly. Casablanca was rushed into release to take advantage of the publicity from the Allied invasion of North Africa a few weeks earlier. It had its world premiere on November 26, 1942, in New York City and was released nationally in the United States on January 23, 1943. The film was a solid if unspectacular success in its initial run.\nExceeding expectations, Casablanca went on to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, while Curtiz was selected as Best Director and the Epsteins and Koch were honored for Best Adapted Screenplay. Its reputation has gradually grown, to the point that its lead characters, memorable lines, and pervasive theme song have all become iconic, and it consistently ranks near the top of lists of the greatest films in history. In 1989, the United States Library of Congress selected the film as one of the first for preservation in the National Film Registry for being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."

During a tremendous storm in 1885, the rainfall washed refuse from the Chicago River far out into the lake.

The Chicago Sanitary District now The Metropolitan Water Reclamation District was said to have been created by the Illinois legislature in 1889 in response to a terrible epidemic which killed thousands of residents of this fledgling city.\nHowever, analysis of the deaths in Chicago shows no deaths from cholera and only a slight rise in typhoid deaths. In fact, no cholera outbreaks had occurred in Chicago since the 1860s. Typhoid deaths never exceeded 1,000 in any year in the 1880s.

            "Late antiquity is the time of transition from classical antiquity to the Middle Ages, generally spanning the 3rd8th century in Europe and adjacent areas bordering the Mediterranean Basin. The popularization of this periodization in English has generally been credited to historian Peter Brown, after the publication of his seminal work The World of Late Antiquity 1971. Precise boundaries for the period are a continuing matter of debate, but Brown proposes a period between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Generally, it can be thought of as from the end of the Roman Empires Crisis of the Third Century 235284 to the early Muslim conquests 622750, or as roughly contemporary with the Sasanian Empire 224651. In the West its end was earlier, with the start of the Early Middle Ages typically placed in the 6th century, or earlier on the edges of the Western Roman Empire.\nThe Roman Empire underwent considerable social, cultural and organizational changes starting with the reign of Diocletian, who began the custom of splitting the Empire into Eastern and Western portions ruled by multiple emperors simultaneously. The Sasanian Empire supplanted the Parthian Empire and began a new phase of the RomanPersian Wars, the RomanSasanian Wars. The divisions between the Greek East and Latin West became more pronounced. The Diocletianic Persecution of Christians in the early 4th century was ended by Galerius and under Constantine the Great, Christianity was made legal in the Empire. The 4th century Christianization of the Roman Empire was extended by the conversions of Tiridates the Great of Armenia, Mirian III of Iberia and Ezana of Axum, who later invaded and ended the Kingdom of Kush. During the late 4th century reign of Theodosius I, Nicene Christianity was proclaimed the state church of the Roman Empire. \nThe city of Constantinople became the permanent imperial residence in the East by the 5th century and superseded Rome as the largest city in the Late Roman Empire and the Mediterranean Basin. The longest Roman aqueduct system, the 250 km 160 mi-long Aqueduct of Valens was constructed to supply it with water, and the tallest Roman triumphal columns were erected there.\nMigrations of Germanic, Hunnic, and Slavic tribes disrupted Roman rule from the late 4th century onwards, culminating first in the Sack of Rome by the Visigoths in 410 and subsequent Sack of Rome by the Vandals in 455, part of the eventual collapse of the Empire in the West itself by 476. The Western Empire was replaced by the so-called barbarian kingdoms, with the Arian Christian Ostrogothic Kingdom ruling Rome from Ravenna. The resultant cultural fusion of Greco-Roman, Germanic, and Christian traditions formed the foundations of the subsequent culture of Europe.\nIn the 6th century, Roman imperial rule continued in the East, and the Byzantine-Sasanian wars continued. The campaigns of Justinian the Great led to the fall of the Ostrogothic and Vandal Kingdoms, and their reincorporation into the Empire, when the city of Rome and much of Italy and North Africa returned to imperial control. Though most of Italy was soon part of the Kingdom of the Lombards, the Roman Exarchate of Ravenna endured, ensuring the so-called Byzantine Papacy. Justinian constructed the Hagia Sophia, a great example of Byzantine architecture, and the first outbreak of the centuries-long first plague pandemic took place. At Ctesiphon, the Sasanians completed the Taq Kasra, the colossal iwan of which is the largest single-span vault of unreinforced brickwork in the world and the triumph of Sasanian architecture.\nThe middle of the 6th century was characterized by extreme climate events the volcanic winter of 535-536 and the Late Antique Little Ice Age and a disastrous pandemic the Plague of Justinian in 541. The effects of these events in the social and political life are still under discussion.\nIn the 7th century the disastrous ByzantineSasanian War of 602628 and the campaigns of Khosrow II and Heraclius facilitated the emergence of Islam in the Arabian Peninsula during the lifetime of Muhammad. Subsequent Muslim conquest of the Levant and Persia overthrew the Sasanian Empire and permanently wrested two thirds of the Eastern Roman Empires territory from Roman control, forming the Rashidun Caliphate.\nThe Byzantine Empire under the Heraclian dynasty began the middle Byzantine period, and together with the establishment of the later 7th century Umayyad Caliphate, generally marks the end of late antiquity.\n\n"

Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the Allegheny West neighborhood and raised in Oakland, California, Stein moved to Paris in 1903, and made France her home for the remainder of her life. She hosted a Paris salon, where the leading figures of modernism in literature and art, such as Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sinclair Lewis, Ezra Pound, Sherwood Anderson and Henri Matisse, would meet.In 1933, Stein published a quasi-memoir of her Paris years, The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, written in the voice of Alice B. Toklas, her life partner. The book became a literary bestseller and vaulted Stein from the relative obscurity of the cult-literature scene into the limelight of mainstream attention. Two quotes from her works have become widely known: Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose, and there is no there there, with the latter often taken to be a reference to her childhood home of Oakland.\nHer books include Q.E.D. 1903, about a lesbian romantic affair involving several of Steins friends; Fernhurst, a fictional story about a love triangle; Three Lives 190506; The Making of Americans 19021911; and Tender Buttons 1914.\nHer activities during World War II have been the subject of analysis and commentary. As a Jew living in Nazi-occupied France, Stein may have only been able to sustain her lifestyle as an art collector, and indeed to ensure her physical safety, through the protection of the powerful Vichy government official and Nazi collaborator Bernard Fa. After the war ended, Stein expressed admiration for another Nazi collaborator, Vichy leader Marshal Ptain."

His ideas played a significant role in the development of Baathism and its political movement; he is considered by several Baathists to be the principal founder of Baathist thought. He published various books during his lifetime, the most notable being The Battle for One Destiny 1958 and The Struggle Against Distorting the Movement of Arab Revolution 1975.\nBorn into a middle-class family in Damascus, Syria, Aflaq studied at the Sorbonne, where he met his future political companion Salah al-Din al-Bitar. He returned to Syria in 1932, and began his political career in communist politics. Aflaq became a communist activist, but broke his ties with the communist movement when the SyrianLebanese Communist Party supported colonial policies through the Popular Front under the French Mandate of Syria. Later in 1940 Aflaq and al-Bitar established the Arab Ihya Movement later renaming itself the Arab Baath Movement, taking the name from Zaki al-Arsuzis group by the same name. The movement proved successful, and in 1947 the Arab Baath Movement merged with al-Arsuzis Arab Baath organisation to establish the Arab Baath Party. Aflaq was elected to the partys executive committee and was elected Amid meaning the partys leader.\nThe Arab Baath Party merged with Akram al-Hawranis Arab Socialist Party to establish the Arab Socialist Baath Party in 1952; Aflaq was elected the partys leader in 1954. During the mid-to-late 1950s the party began developing relations with Gamal Abdel Nasser, the President of Egypt, which eventually led to the establishment of the United Arab Republic UAR. Nasser forced Aflaq to dissolve the party, which he did, but without consulting with party members. Shortly after the UARs dissolution, Aflaq was reelected as Secretary General of the National Command of the Baath Party. Following the 8th of March Revolution, Aflaqs position within the party was weakened to such an extent that he was forced to resign as the partys leader in 1965. Aflaq was ousted during the 1966 Syrian coup dtat, which led to a schism within the Baath Party. He escaped to Lebanon, but later went to Iraq. In 1968 Aflaq was elected Secretary General of the Iraqi-led Baath Party; during his tenure he held no de facto power. He held the post until his death on 23 June 1989.\nAflaqs theories about society, economics, and politics, which are collectively known as Baathism, hold that the Arab world needs to be unified into one Arab Nation in order to achieve an advanced state of development. He was critical of both capitalism and communism, and critical of Karl Marxs view of dialectical materialism as the only truth. Baathist thought placed much emphasis on liberty and Arab socialism  a socialism with Arab characteristics, which was not part of the international socialist movement as defined by the West. Aflaq believed in the separation of state and religion, and was a strong believer in secularisation, but was against atheism. Although a Christian, he believed Islam to be proof of Arab genius. In the aftermath of the 1966 Baath Party split, the Syrian-led Baath Party accused Aflaq of stealing al-Arsuzis ideas, and called him a thief. The Iraqi-led Baath Party rejects this, and does not believe that al-Arsuzi contributed to Baathist thought."

            "The phrase man bites dog is a shortened version of an aphorism in journalism that describes how an unusual, infrequent event such as a man biting a dog is more likely to be reported as news than an ordinary, everyday occurrence with similar consequences, such as a dog biting a man. An event is usually considered more newsworthy if there is something unusual about it; a commonplace event is less likely to be seen as newsworthy, even if the consequences of both events have objectively similar outcomes. The result is that rarer events more often appear as news stories, while more common events appear less often, thus distorting the perceptions of news consumers of what constitutes normal rates of occurrence.\nThe phenomenon is also described in the journalistic saying, You never read about a plane that did not crash.The phrase was coined by Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe 18651922, a British newspaper magnate, but is also attributed to New York Sun editor John B.

The span of recorded history is roughly 5,000 years, beginning with the Sumerian cuneiform script. Ancient history covers all continents inhabited by humans in the period 3000 BC  AD 500. The three-age system periodizes ancient history into the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age, with recorded history generally considered to begin with the Bronze Age. The start and end of the three ages varies between world regions. In many regions the Bronze Age is generally considered to begin a few centuries prior to 3000 BC, while the end of the Iron Age varies from the early first millennium BC in some regions to the late first millennium AD in others.During the time period of ancient history, the world population was already exponentially increasing due to the Neolithic Revolution, which was in full progress. While in 10,000 BC, the world population stood at 2 million, it rose to 45 million by 3,000 BC. By the Iron Age in 1000 BC, the population had risen to 72 million. By the end of the ancient period in AD 500, the world population is thought to have stood at 209 million. In 10,500 years, the world population increased by 100 times."

Starring Roddy Piper, Keith David, and Meg Foster, the film follows an unnamed drifter who discovers through special sunglasses that the ruling class are aliens concealing their appearance and manipulating people to consume, breed, and conform to the status quo via subliminal messages in mass media.\nHaving acquired the film rights to the Nelson-penned short story prior to the production of They Live, Carpenter used the story as the basis for the screenplays structure, which he wrote under the pseudonym Frank Armitage. Carpenter has stated that the themes of They Live stemmed from his dissatisfaction with the economic policies of then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan, as well as what Carpenter saw as increasing commercialization in both popular culture and politics. In 2017, in response to misreadings of the films themes, Carpenter further clarified that the film is about yuppies and unrestrained capitalism.They Live was a minor success upon release, debuting at #1 at the North American box office. It initially received negative reviews from critics, who lambasted its social commentary, writing, and acting; however, it later gained a cult following and experienced a significantly more favorable critical reception. It is now regarded by many as a largely underrated work. The film has also entered the pop culture lexicon, notably having a lasting effect on street art particularly that of Shepard Fairey. A nearly six-minute sequence in which the protagonists brawl in an alley has made appearances on all-time lists for best fight scenes.\n\n"

The game is set in 2027, in a fictional metropolis called Sunset City. The player controls an employee of FizzCo, who has to fight off the OD, short for Overcharge Drinkers: humans who have turned into mutants after drinking FizzCos energy drink beverage. In the dystopian Sunset City, the player character can wall-run, use zip-lines, and grind rails to swiftly navigate through it, with a large arsenal of weapons to use. The game also has a cooperative multiplayer mode called Chaos Squad, which tasks players to complete a series of missions with seven players. As the game puts emphasis on momentum, the game does not feature any cover system.\nThe development of the game began in 2011 when Insomniac completed Resistance 3. After the project was green-lit internally, the studio partnered with Microsoft Studios, which helped fund the game and allowed Insomniac to keep the rights to the franchise. Insomniac described the game as a celebration of games, as the team took inspiration from different sources, including Prince of Persia, Jet Set Radio and Tony Hawks Pro Skater, though at its early stage of development the team took inspirations from DayZ instead. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic future, but the team depicted it as an awesomepocalypse that turns the games initial world depiction into a playground for players. Sunset Overdrive uses Insomniacs internal engine, previously used in Fuse.\nIt was announced at E3 2013, and released worldwide for Xbox One in October 2014. A Windows version, developed by Blind Squirrel Games, was released in November 2018. The game received generally positive reviews, with praise for its visuals, traversal system, combat system, and humor. However, the game was criticized for the lack of a compelling story or innovative quest design. It received numerous nominations, including Best Xbox Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. The game was supported with multiple pieces of downloadable content, including the story-based The Mystery of the Mooil Rig and Dawn of the Rise of the Fallen Machine, after the games release."

Released for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Nvidia Shield TV, and Microsoft Windows, it is a spin-off in the Metal Gear series, and is set four years after the events of Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots. In the game, players control Raiden, a cyborg who confronts the private military company Desperado Enforcement, with the gameplay focusing on fighting enemies using a sword and other weapons to perform combos and counterattacks. Through the use of Blade Mode, Raiden can cut cyborgs in slow motion and steal parts stored in their bodies. The series usual stealth elements are also optional to reduce combat.\nThe game was originally being developed internally by Kojima Productions, who announced the game in 2009 under the title of Metal Gear Solid: Rising. However, the team met with difficulties in developing a game based on swordplay, so executive producer Hideo Kojima postponed its development until a solution could be found. The project resurfaced in late 2011 under its finalized title, with PlatinumGames as the new developer. The game underwent significant changes in its play mechanics and storyline under PlatinumGames involvement, although Kojima Productions retained responsibility for the games overall plot and Raidens design.\nUpon its worldwide release in February 2013, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance was well received by critics, being praised for its sophisticated cutting system, its use of Metal Gear elements to complement the story despite the games focus on action, its soundtrack, and its boss fights; some criticism was directed at its camera mechanics and the short length of the story mode. The game also enjoyed positive sales, with the PS3 and Steam versions selling an estimated total of more than 1.2 million copies. While those involved in the games production have expressed desire to develop a sequel, such prospects have yet to come to fruition due to the ensuing conflicts between Konami and Kojima Productions."

            "The Holy Roman Empire was a political entity in Western, Central, and Southern Europe that developed during the Early Middle Ages and continued until its dissolution in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars.From the accession of Otto I in 962 until the twelfth century, the Empire was the most powerful monarchy in Europe. Andrew Holt characterizes it as perhaps the most powerful European state of the Middle Ages. The functioning of government depended on the harmonic cooperation dubbed consensual rulership by Bernd Schneidmller between monarch and vassals but this harmony was disturbed during the Salian period. The empire reached the apex of territorial expansion and power under the House of Hohenstaufen in the mid-thirteenth century, but overextending led to partial collapse.On 25 December 800, Pope Leo III crowned the Frankish king Charlemagne as emperor, reviving the title in Western Europe, more than three centuries after the fall of the earlier ancient Western Roman Empire in 476. In theory and diplomacy, the emperors were considered primus inter pares, regarded as first among equals among other Catholic monarchs across Europe. The title continued in the Carolingian family until 888 and from 896 to 899, after which it was contested by the rulers of Italy in a series of civil wars until the death of the last Italian claimant, Berengar I, in 924. The title was revived again in 962 when Otto I, King of Germany, was crowned emperor by Pope John XII, fashioning himself as the successor of Charlemagne and beginning a continuous existence of the empire for over eight centuries. Some historians refer to the coronation of Charlemagne as the origin of the empire, while others prefer the coronation of Otto I as its beginning. Henry the Fowler, the founder of the medieval German state ruled 919936, has sometimes been considered the founder of the Empire as well. The modern view favours Otto as the true founder. Scholars generally concur in relating an evolution of the institutions and principles constituting the empire, describing a gradual assumption of the imperial title and role.The exact term Holy Roman Empire was not used until the 13th century, but the Emperors legitimacy always rested on the concept of translatio imperii, that he held supreme power inherited from the ancient emperors of Rome. The imperial office was traditionally elective through the mostly German prince-electors.\nDuring the final phase of the reign of Emperor Frederick III ruled 14521493, Imperial Reform began. The reform would largely be materialized during Maximilian Is rule from 1486 as King of the Romans, from 1493 as sole ruler, and from 1508 as Holy Roman Emperor, until his death in 1519. The Empire transformed into the Holy Roman Empire of the German nation. It was during this time that the Empire gained most of its institutions that endured until its final demise in the nineteenth century. Thomas Brady Jr. opines that the Imperial Reform was successful, although perhaps at the expense of the reform of the Church, partly because Maximilian was not really serious about the religious matter.According to Brady Jr., the Empire, after the Imperial Reform, was a political body of remarkable longevity and stability, and resembled in some respects the monarchical polities of Europes western tier, and in others the loosely integrated, elective polities of East Central Europe. The new corporate German Nation, instead of simply obeying the emperor, negotiated with him. On 6 August 1806, Emperor Francis II dissolved the empire following the creation of the Confederation of the Rhine by Emperor of the French Napoleon I the month before."

Huck does not seem to exist in a specific time period as he has also been a Roman gladiator, a medieval knight, and a rocket scientist. He also appears in futuristic cartoons, as an intergalactic space policeman, alongside other Hanna-Barbera characters. The trademark of Huck was his tone-deaf and inaccurate rendition of Oh My Darling, Clementine, often used as a running gag."

He is assaulted as a result of mistaken identity, then learns that a millionaire also named Jeffrey Lebowski David Huddleston was the intended victim. The millionaire Lebowskis trophy wife is kidnapped, and millionaire Lebowski commissions The Dude to deliver the ransom to secure her release; the plan goes awry when the Dudes friend Walter Sobchak John Goodman schemes to keep the ransom money for themselves. Sam Elliott, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Tara Reid, David Thewlis, Peter Stormare, Jon Polito, and Ben Gazzara also appear, in supporting roles.\nThe film is loosely inspired by the work of Raymond Chandler. Joel Coen stated, We wanted to do a Chandler kind of story  how it moves episodically, and deals with the characters trying to unravel a mystery, as well as having a hopelessly complex plot thats ultimately unimportant. The original score was composed by Carter Burwell, a longtime collaborator of the Coen brothers.\nThe Big Lebowski received mixed reviews at the time of its release. Over time, reviews have become largely positive, and the film has become a cult favorite, noted for its eccentric characters, comedic dream sequences, idiosyncratic dialogue, and eclectic soundtrack. In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant. A spin-off, titled The Jesus Rolls, was released in 2020, with Turturro reprising his role and also serving as writer and director.\n\n"

It later became known collectively as cognitive science. The relevant areas of interchange were between the fields of psychology, linguistics, computer science, anthropology, neuroscience, and philosophy. The approaches used were developed within the then-nascent fields of artificial intelligence, computer science, and neuroscience. In the 1960s, the Harvard Center for Cognitive Studies and the Center for Human Information Processing at the University of California San Diego were influential in developing the academic study of cognitive science. By the early 1970s, the cognitive movement had surpassed behaviorism as a psychological paradigm. Furthermore, by the early 1980s the cognitive approach had become the dominant line of research inquiry across most branches in the field of psychology.\nA key goal of early cognitive psychology was to apply the scientific method to the study of human cognition. Some of the main ideas and developments from the cognitive revolution were the use of the scientific method in cognitive science research, the necessity of mental systems to process sensory input, the innateness of these systems, and the modularity of the mind. Important publications in triggering the cognitive revolution include psychologist George Millers 1956 article The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two one of the most frequently cited papers in psychology, linguist Noam Chomskys Syntactic Structures 1957 and Review of B. F. Skinners Verbal Behavior 1959, and foundational works in the field of artificial intelligence by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Allen Newell, and Herbert Simon, such as the 1958 article Elements of a Theory of Human Problem Solving. Ulric Neissers 1967 book Cognitive Psychology was also a landmark contribution."

Having studied many photographs, paintings and etchings, he discovered that details of interest were often placed precisely on the diagonals of a square, instead of any strong points that the rule of thirds or the photographic adaptation of the golden ratio suggests. A photograph is usually a rectangular shape with a ratio of 4:3 or 3:2, from which the diagonals of the photograph are placed at the bisection of each corner. Manually placing certain elements of interest on these lines results in a more pleasing photograph."

            "Claims of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism have been extensively investigated and found to be false. The link was first suggested in the early 1990s and came to public notice largely as a result of the 1998 Lancet MMR autism fraud, characterised as perhaps the most damaging medical hoax of the last 100 years. The fraudulent research paper authored by Andrew Wakefield and published in The Lancet claimed to link the vaccine to colitis and autism spectrum disorders. The paper was retracted in 2010 but is still cited by anti-vaccinationists.The claims in the paper were widely reported, leading to a sharp drop in vaccination rates in the UK and Ireland. Promotion of the claimed link, which continues in anti-vaccination propaganda despite being refuted, has led to an increase in the incidence of measles and mumps, resulting in deaths and serious permanent injuries. Following the initial claims in 1998, multiple large epidemiological studies were undertaken. Reviews of the evidence by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Institute of Medicine of the US National Academy of Sciences, the UK National Health Service, and the Cochrane Library all found no link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Physicians, medical journals, and editors have described Wakefields actions as fraudulent and tied them to epidemics and deaths.An investigation by journalist Brian Deer found that Wakefield, the author of the original research paper linking the vaccine to autism, had multiple undeclared conflicts of interest, had manipulated evidence, and had broken other ethical codes. The Lancet paper was partially retracted in 2004 and fully retracted in 2010, when Lancets editor-in-chief Richard Horton described it as utterly false and said that the journal had been deceived. Wakefield was found guilty by the General Medical Council of serious professional misconduct in May 2010 and was struck off the Medical Register, meaning he could no longer practise as a physician in the UK. In January 2011, Deer published a series of reports in the British Medical Journal, which in a signed editorial stated of the journalist, It has taken the diligent scepticism of one man, standing outside medicine and science, to show that the paper was in fact an elaborate fraud. The scientific consensus is that there is no link between the MMR vaccine and autism and that the vaccines benefits greatly outweigh its potential risks."

Although only 21% of motorists admitted to backseat driving, half said they have been in arguments due to interfering comments, and five percent admitted to accidentally jumping a red light during an argument with a backseat driver.Use of the term extends beyond the literal and into the figurative; a backseat driver is someone who offers unsolicited advice, directions, or help in a situation where someone else is doing something."

He held academic positions in English literature at both Oxford University Magdalen College, 19251954 and Cambridge University Magdalene College, 19541963. He is best known as the author of The Chronicles of Narnia, but he is also noted for his other works of fiction, such as The Screwtape Letters and The Space Trilogy, and for his non-fiction Christian apologetics, including Mere Christianity, Miracles, and The Problem of Pain.\nLewis was a close friend of J. R. R. Tolkien, author of The Lord of the Rings. Both men served on the English faculty at Oxford University and were active in the informal Oxford literary group known as the Inklings. According to Lewiss 1955 memoir Surprised by Joy, he was baptized in the Church of Ireland but fell away from his faith during adolescence. Lewis returned to Anglicanism at the age of 32, owing to the influence of Tolkien and other friends, and he became an ordinary layman of the Church of England. Lewiss faith profoundly affected his work, and his wartime radio broadcasts on the subject of Christianity brought him wide acclaim.\nLewis wrote more than 30 books which have been translated into more than 30 languages and have sold millions of copies. The books that make up The Chronicles of Narnia have sold the most and have been popularized on stage, TV, radio, and cinema. His philosophical writings are widely cited by Christian scholars from many denominations.\nIn 1956, Lewis married American writer Joy Davidman; she died of cancer four years later at the age of 45. Lewis died on 22 November 1963 from kidney failure, one week before his 65th birthday. In 2013, on the 50th anniversary of his death, Lewis was honoured with a memorial in Poets Corner in Westminster Abbey."

In the early modern era, he was regarded as a wizard and particularly famed for the story of his mechanical or necromantic brazen head. He is sometimes credited mainly since the 19th century as one of the earliest European advocates of the modern scientific method, along with his teacher Robert Grosseteste. Bacon applied the empirical method of Ibn al-Haytham Alhazen to observations in texts attributed to Aristotle. Bacon discovered the importance of empirical testing when the results he obtained were different from those that would have been predicted by Aristotle.His linguistic work has been heralded for its early exposition of a universal grammar, and 21st-century re-evaluations emphasise that Bacon was essentially a medieval thinker, with much of his experimental knowledge obtained from books in the scholastic tradition. He was, however, partially responsible for a revision of the medieval university curriculum, which saw the addition of optics to the traditional quadrivium.Bacons major work, the Opus Majus, was sent to Pope Clement IV in Rome in 1267 upon the popes request.

Directed by John Lasseter and co-directed by Andrew Stanton, the film involves a misfit ant, Flik, who is looking for tough warriors to save his colony from a protection racket run by a gang of grasshoppers. Unfortunately, the warriors he brings back turn out to be an inept troupe of Circus Bugs.\nThe film was initially inspired by Aesops fable The Ant and the Grasshopper. Production began shortly after the release of Toy Story in 1995. The screenplay was penned by Stanton and comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw from a story by Lasseter, Stanton, and Joe Ranft. The ants in the film were redesigned to be more appealing, and Pixars animation unit employed technical innovations in computer animation. Randy Newman composed the music for the film. During production, a controversial public feud erupted between Steve Jobs and Lasseter of Pixar and DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg due to the parallel production of his similar film Antz, which was released the same year.\nThe film was released on November 20, 1998, received positive reviews and grossed $363 million at the box office. It was the first film to be digitally transferred frame-by-frame and released on DVD, and has been released multiple times on home video."

Donnie often speaks in technobabble with a natural aptitude for science and technology. His ninja skills are the lowest of the four turtles; as he relies on gadgets over combat skills.

            "Baruch de Spinoza born Bento de Espinosa; later as an author and a correspondent Benedictus de Spinoza, anglicized to Benedict de Spinoza; 24 November 1632  21 February 1677 was a Dutch philosopher of Portuguese-Jewish origin, born in Amsterdam. One of the foremost exponents of 17th-century Rationalism and one of the early and seminal thinkers of the Enlightenment and modern biblical criticism including modern conceptions of the self and the universe, he came to be considered one of the most important philosophersand certainly the most radicalof the early modern period. Inspired by Stoicism, Jewish Rationalism, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Descartes, and a variety of heterodox religious thinkers of his day, Spinoza became a leading philosophical figure during the Dutch Golden Age. Spinozas given name, which means Blessed, varies among different languages. In Hebrew, his full name is written  . In most of the documents and records contemporary with Spinozas years within the Jewish community, his name is given as Bento, Portuguese for Blessed. In his works in Latin, he used the name Benedictus de Spinoza.\nSpinoza was raised in the Portuguese-Jewish community of Amsterdam. He developed highly controversial ideas regarding the authenticity of the Hebrew Bible and the nature of the Divine. Jewish religious authorities issued a herem  against him, causing him to be effectively expelled and shunned by Jewish society at age 23, including by his own family. He was frequently called an atheist by contemporaries, although nowhere in his work does Spinoza argue against the existence of God. Spinoza lived an outwardly simple life as an optical lens grinder, collaborating on microscope and telescope lens designs with Constantijn and Christiaan Huygens. He turned down rewards and honours throughout his life, including prestigious teaching positions. He died at the age of 44 in 1677 from a lung illness, perhaps tuberculosis or silicosis exacerbated by the inhalation of fine glass dust while grinding lenses. He is buried in the Christian churchyard of Nieuwe Kerk in The Hague. In June 1678just over a year after Spinozas deaththe States of Holland banned his entire works, since they contain very many profane, blasphemous and atheistic propositions. The prohibition included the owning, reading, distribution, copying, and restating of Spinozas books, and even the reworking of his fundamental ideas. Shortly after 1679/1690 his books were added to the Catholic Churchs Index of Forbidden Books.Spinozas philosophy encompasses nearly every area of philosophical discourse, including metaphysics, epistemology, political philosophy, ethics, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of science. It earned Spinoza an enduring reputation as one of the most important and original thinkers of the seventeenth century. Spinozas philosophy is largely contained in two books: the Theologico-Political Treatise, and the Ethics. The rest of the writings we have from Spinoza are either earlier or incomplete works expressing thoughts that were crystallized in the two aforementioned books e.g., the Short Treatise and the Treatise on the Emendation of the Intellect, or else they are not directly concerned with Spinozas own philosophy e.g., The Principles of Cartesian Philosophy and The Hebrew Grammar. He also left behind many letters that help to illuminate his ideas and provide some insight into what may have been motivating his views. The Theologico-Political Treatise was published during his lifetime, but the work which contains the entirety of his philosophical system in its most rigorous form, the Ethics, was published posthumously in the year of his death. The work opposed Descartess philosophy of mindbody dualism and earned Spinoza recognition as one of Western philosophys most important thinkers.\n\n"

When a person makes a judgment about a certain thinggood or bad or beautiful or unjustthat person will differ from other peoples judgments because their experience has been different.This concept of individual relativity was intended to be provocative; naturally, it drew fire from Plato and other philosophers, contrasting with both popular opinion and other philosophical doctrine that reality and its truth must have an objective grounding. But it was part of Protagoras point that the statement is somewhat counterintuitive. He argued that believing that others opinions about the world are valid and must be respected, even if our own experience of truth is different, is necessary for a community to base itself and its decisions on open, democratic debate."

In natural philosophy he is known for The Singular Universe and the Reality of Time. In social theory he is known for Politics: A Work in Constructive Social Theory. In legal theory he was associated with the Critical Legal Studies movement, which helped disrupt the methodological consensus in American law schools. His political activity helped the transition to democracy in Brazil in the aftermath of the military regime, and culminated with his appointment as Brazils Minister of Strategic Affairs in 2007 and again in 2015. His work is seen to offer a vision of humanity and a program to empower individuals and change institutions.At the core of his philosophy is a view of humanity as greater than the contexts in which it is placed. He sees each individual possessed with the capability to rise to a greater life. At the root of his social thought is the conviction that the social world is made and imagined. His work begins from the premise that no natural or necessary social, political, or economic arrangements underlie individual or social activity. Property rights, liberal democracy, wage laborfor Unger, these are all historical artifacts that have no necessary relation to the goals of free and prosperous human activity. For Unger, the market, the state, and human social organization should not be set in predetermined institutional arrangements, but need to be left open to experimentation and revision according to what works for the project of individual and collective empowerment. Doing so, he holds, will enable human liberation.Unger has long been active in Brazilian opposition politics. He was one of the founding members of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party and drafted its manifesto. He directed the presidential campaigns of Leonel Brizola and Ciro Gomes, ran for the Chamber of Deputies, and twice launched exploratory bids for the Brazilian presidency.

The term originated with a scholiast on Thucydides, who used it in their description of the period. The Pentecontaetia was marked by the rise of Athens as the dominant state in the Greek world and by the rise of Athenian democracy, a period also known as Golden Age of Athens. Since Thucydides focused his account on these developments, the term is generally used when discussing developments in and involving Athens.Shortly after the Greek victory of 479 BC, Athens assumed the leadership of the Delian League, a coalition of states that wished to continue the war against Persia. This league experienced a number of successes and was soon established as the dominant military force of the Aegean. Athenian control over the league grew as some allies were reduced to the status of tribute-paying subjects and by the middle of the 5th century BC the league treasury was moved from Delos to Athens in 454 BC the league had been transformed into an Athenian empire. Athens benefited greatly from this tribute, undergoing a cultural renaissance and undertaking massive public building projects, including the Parthenon; Athenian democracy, meanwhile, developed into what is today called radical or Periclean democracy, in which the popular assembly of the citizens and the large, citizen juries exercised near-complete control over the state.\nThe later years of the Pentecontaetia were marked by increasing conflict between Athens and the traditional land powers of Greece, led by Sparta. Between 460 BC and 445 BC, Athens fought a shifting coalition of mainland powers in what is now known as the First Peloponnesian War. During the course of this conflict, Athens gained and then lost control of large areas of central Greece. The conflict was concluded by the Thirty Years Peace, which lasted until the end of the Pentecontaetia and the beginning of the Peloponnesian War.\nThe eventual breakdown of the peace was triggered by increasing conflict between Athens and several of Spartas allies. Athens alliance with Corcyra and attack on Potidaea enraged Corinth, and the Megarian Decree imposed strict economic sanctions on Megara, another Spartan ally. These disputes, along with a general perception that Athenian power had grown too powerful, led to the breakdown of the Thirty Years Peace; the Peloponnesian War broke out in 431 BC."

            "Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov 22 April O.S. 10 April 1870  21 January 1924, better known as Vladimir Lenin, was a Russian revolutionary, politician, and political theorist. He served as the first and founding head of government of Soviet Russia from 1917 to 1924 and of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1924. Under his administration, Russia, and later the Soviet Union, became a one-party socialist state governed by the Communist Party. Ideologically a Marxist, his developments to the ideology are called Leninism.\nBorn to an upper-middle-class family in Simbirsk, Lenin embraced revolutionary socialist politics following his brothers 1887 execution. Expelled from Kazan Imperial University for participating in protests against the Russian Empires Tsarist government, he devoted the following years to a law degree. He moved to Saint Petersburg in 1893 and became a senior Marxist activist. In 1897, he was arrested for sedition and exiled to Shushenskoye in Siberia for three years, where he married Nadezhda Krupskaya. After his exile, he moved to Western Europe, where he became a prominent theorist in the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party RSDLP. In 1903, he took a key role in the RSDLP ideological split, leading the Bolshevik faction against Julius Martovs Mensheviks. Following Russias failed Revolution of 1905, he campaigned for the First World War to be transformed into a Europe-wide proletarian revolution, which, as a Marxist, he believed would cause the overthrow of capitalism and its replacement with socialism. After the 1917 February Revolution ousted the Tsar and established a Provisional Government, he returned to Russia to play a leading role in the October Revolution in which the Bolsheviks overthrew the new regime.\nLenins Bolshevik government initially shared power with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, elected soviets, and a multi-party Constituent Assembly, although by 1918 it had centralised power in the new Communist Party. Lenins administration redistributed land among the peasantry and nationalised banks and large-scale industry. It withdrew from the First World War by signing a treaty conceding territory to the Central Powers, and promoted world revolution through the Communist International. Opponents were suppressed in the Red Terror, a violent campaign administered by the state security services; tens of thousands were killed or interned in concentration camps. His administration defeated right and left-wing anti-Bolshevik armies in the Russian Civil War from 1917 to 1922 and oversaw the PolishSoviet War of 19191921. Responding to wartime devastation, famine, and popular uprisings, in 1921 Lenin encouraged economic growth through the New Economic Policy. Several non-Russian nations had secured independence from the Russian Empire after 1917, but three were re-united into the new Soviet Union in 1922. His health failing, Lenin died in Gorki, with Joseph Stalin succeeding him as the pre-eminent figure in the Soviet government.\nWidely considered one of the most significant and influential figures of the 20th century, Lenin was the posthumous subject of a pervasive personality cult within the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991. He became an ideological figurehead behind MarxismLeninism and a prominent influence over the international communist movement. A controversial and highly divisive historical figure, Lenin is viewed by his supporters as a champion of socialism and the working class. Meanwhile, Lenins critics accuse him of establishing a totalitarian dictatorship which oversaw mass killings and political repression."

Brought into popular culture by the Scarlet Pimpernel in 1903, the concept was widespread in pulp heroes and is particularly prevalent in the American comic book genre, and is a trope of the masquerade.In American comic books, a character typically has dual identities, one public and one secret. The public identity being known to the general public as the superhero persona and the other being the secret identity. The private or secret identity is typically the superheros legal name, true identity, and/or civilian persona when they are not actively assuming the superhero persona. It is kept hidden from their enemies and the general public to protect themselves from legal ramifications, pressure, or public scrutiny, as well as to protect their friends and loved ones from harm secondary to their actions as superheroes.\nOccasionally, this trope is inverted. Two prime examples of this are the Marvel Cinematic Universe films Iron Man 2008, where the film ends with the lead character declaring to the world I am Iron Man, and Spider-Man: No Way Home 2021, where it ends with Peter Parkers civilian persona being permanently erased from the memory of the entire world, as a result of a spell by Doctor Strange.\n\n"

Wilder also starred in the lead role as the title character, a descendant of the infamous Dr. Victor Frankenstein. Peter Boyle portrayed the monster. The film co-stars Teri Garr, Cloris Leachman, Marty Feldman, Madeline Kahn, Kenneth Mars, Richard Haydn, and Gene Hackman.\nThe film is a parody of the classic horror film genre, in particular the various film adaptations of Mary Shelleys 1818 novel Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus produced by Universal Pictures in the 1930s. Much of the lab equipment used as props was created by Kenneth Strickfaden for the 1931 film Frankenstein. To help evoke the atmosphere of the earlier films, Brooks shot the picture entirely in black and white, a rarity in the 1970s, and employed 1930s-style opening credits and scene transitions such as iris outs, wipes, and fades to black. The film also features a period score by Brooks longtime composer John Morris.\nA critical favorite and box-office hit, Young Frankenstein ranks No. 28 on Total Film magazines readers List of the 50 Greatest Comedy Films of All Time, No. 56 on Bravos list of the 100 Funniest Movies, and No. 13 on the American Film Institutes list of the 100 funniest American movies. In 2003, it was deemed culturally, historically or aesthetically significant by the United States National Film Preservation Board, and selected for preservation in the Library of Congress National Film Registry. It was later adapted by Brooks and Thomas Meehan as a stage musical. The film received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Sound and Best Adapted Screenplay, the latter of which was a nomination shared with Wilder and Brooks.\nOn its 40th anniversary, Brooks considered it by far his finest although not his funniest film as a writer-director."

He was pessimistic about life, describing himself as a double prisoner of blindness and isolation. He attacked religious dogmas and practices, was equally critical and sarcastic about Judaism, Christianity, Islam and Zoroastrianism, and became a deist. He advocated social justice and lived a secluded, ascetic lifestyle. He was a vegan, known in his time as moral vegetarian, entreating: do not desire as food the flesh of slaughtered animals / Or the white milk of mothers who intended its pure draught for their young. Al-Maarri held an antinatalist outlook, in line with his general pessimism, suggesting that children should not be born to spare them of the pains and suffering of life.Al-Maarri wrote three main works that were popular in his time: The Tinder Spark, Unnecessary Necessity, and The Epistle of Forgiveness. Al-Maarri never married and died at the age of 83 in the city where he was born, Maarrat al-Numan.

In Streets, an R&B ballad with elements of trap music, Doja Cat sings and raps about her desire to return to a former romantic partner. Some critics who reviewed Hot Pink praised the song for demonstrating her versatility as a musical artist.\nStreets became an Internet-driven sleeper hit in early 2021. It gained commercial success after the Silhouette Challenge, an online challenge in which participants struck poses while illuminated from behind with red lighting, used the song as background music and went viral on TikTok. Reacting to its online popularity, Kemosabe and RCA Records promoted Streets to US contemporary hit radio stations on February 16, 2021. With this, the song became Hot Pinks seventh and final single. Assisted primarily by streams and digital sales, Streets peaked at number 16 and number 8 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and Global 200 charts, respectively. It received platinum certifications in eight countries.\nDoja Cat performed Streets in three videos posted to YouTube during 2020; she also included it in performances at the 2021 iHeartRadio Music Awards and the 2022 Coachella festival. A music video for the song, directed by Christian Breslauer, premiered via YouTube on March 9, 2021. It depicts Doja Cats attempt to seduce a cab driver by performing her version of the Silhouette Challenge, after which she proceeds to trap him in a giant web.

These references are sometimes made deliberately and depend on a readers prior knowledge and understanding of the referent, but the effect of intertextuality is not always intentional and is sometimes inadvertent. Often associated with strategies employed by writers working in imaginative registers fiction, poetry, and drama and even non-written texts like performance art and digital media, intertextuality is now understood to be intrinsic to any text.Intertextuality has been differentiated into referential and typological categories. Referential intertextuality refers to the use of fragments in texts and the typological intertextuality refers to the use of pattern and structure in typical texts. A distinction can also be made between iterability and presupposition. Iterability makes reference to the repeatability of certain text that is composed of traces, pieces of other texts that help constitute its meaning. Presupposition makes a reference to assumptions a text makes about its readers and its context. As philosopher William Irwin wrote, the term has come to have almost as many meanings as users, from those faithful to Julia Kristevas original vision to those who simply use it as a stylish way of talking about allusion and influence."

The judging is often handled by a panel of judges, typically five, who are usually selected from the audience. Sometimes the poets are judged by audience response."

Additionally, the series has seen adaptations in the form of a live-action film and an anime, and has been the base for manga series, drama CDs, musicals and stage plays.\nThe player takes the roles of various defense attorneys, including Phoenix Wright, his mentor Mia Fey, and his understudies Apollo Justice and Athena Cykes, who investigate cases and defend their clients in court; they find the truth by cross-examining witnesses and finding inconsistencies between the testimonies and the evidence they have collected. The cases all last a maximum of three days, with the judge determining the outcome based on evidence presented by the defense attorney and the prosecutor. While the original Japanese versions of the games are set in Japan, the series localizations are set in the United States primarily Los Angeles, though retaining Japanese cultural elements. In the spin-off series Ace Attorney Investigations, the player takes the role of prosecutor Miles Edgeworth and in the prequel series The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles, of Phoenixs ancestor Ryunosuke Naruhodo. \nThe series was created by the writer and director Shu Takumi. He wanted the series to end after the third game, but it continued, with Takeshi Yamazaki taking over as writer and director starting with Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth 2009; Takumi has since returned to write and direct some spin-off titles. The series has been well received, with reviewers liking the characters and story, and the finding of contradictions; it has also performed well commercially, with Capcom regarding it as one of their strongest intellectual properties. The series has been credited with helping to popularize visual novels in the Western world. As of September 30, 2022, the game series has sold 9.6 million units worldwide.\n\n"

            "The Second Temple period in Jewish history lasted approximately 600 years 516 BCE - 70 CE, during which the Second Temple existed. It started with the return to Zion and the construction of the Second Temple, while it ended with the First JewishRoman War and the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE.\nIn 587/6 BCE, the Kingdom of Judah was conquered by the Neo-Babylonian Empire. The Judeans lost their independence and monarchy, and their holy city was destroyed. Part of the Judean population was exiled to Babylon; it was eventually allowed to return following a proclamation by the Persian king Cyrus the Great that was issued after the fall of Babylon to the Achaemenid Empire. Under Persian provincial governance c. 539  c. 332 BCE, the returned Jewish population in Judah was allowed to self-govern and rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem. In 332 BCE, Judea was conquered by Alexander the Great, and later incorporated into the Ptolemaic Kingdom c. 301-200 BCE and the Seleucid Empire c. 200167 BCE.\nThe Maccabean revolt against Seleucid rule led to the establishment of an independent Hasmonean Kingdom 14037 BCE, which later, via a series of military campaigns expanded over much of modern Israel and parts of Jordan and Lebanon. In 63 BCE, the kingdom was conquered by the Roman Republic, and in 37 BCE, the Romans appointed Herod the Great as king of a vassal Judea. In 6 BCE, it was fully incorporated into the Roman Empire as the province of Judaea. Growing dissatisfaction with Roman rule eventually led to the First Jewish-Roman War 66-73 CE, which resulted in the destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple, bringing an end to the Second Temple period.\nAs Second Temple Judaism developed, multiple religious currents emerged and extensive cultural, religious, and political developments occurred. The development of the Hebrew Bible canon, the synagogue and Jewish eschatology can be traced back to the Second Temple period. According to Jewish tradition, prophecy ceased during the early Second Temple period; this left the Jews without their version of divine guidance at a time when they felt most in need of support and direction. Under Hellenistic rule, the growing influence of Hellenism in Judaism became a source of dissent for those Jews who clung to their monotheistic faith; this was a major catalyst for the Maccabean revolt. A number of messianic ideas developed during the later Second Temple period. From c. 170 BCE to 30 CE, five successive generations of zugot pairs of leaders headed the Jews spiritual affairs. It was during this period that the sects of the Pharisees, Sadducees, Essenes, Zealots, and early Christianity were formed.\nThe destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple in 70 CE is considered one of the most cataclysmic events in Jewish history. The loss of mother-city and temple necessitated a reshaping of Jewish culture to ensure its survival. Judaisms Temple-based sects, most notably the Sadducees, diminished in importance and disappeared. Rabbinic Judaism, centered around communal synagogue worship and Torah study, eventually evolved out of the Pharisaic school and became the mainstream form of the religion. During the same period, Christianity gradually separated from Judaism, becoming a predominantly Gentile religion. A few decades after the First Jewish-Roman War, the Bar-Kokhba Revolt 132-135 CE erupted; it further dwindled the Jewish population in Judea and enhanced the role of Jewish diaspora, relocating the Jewish demographic center to Galilee and Babylon, with smaller communities across the Mediterranean."

After his father dedicated his life to eliminating Spider-Man and died as a result, Alistair inherited his Spider-Slayer legacy and developed a hatred for the web-slinger. He turned to a life of crime to exact revenge on Spider-Man, and created a new generation of Spider-Slayers to kill him, but this only resulted in Alistair getting paralyzed from the waist down. Later, he encased his body in a bioorganic carapace that allowed him to walk again, in addition to giving him superpowers, and adopted the alias of the Ultimate Spider-Slayer.\nThe character has been adapted from the comics into several forms of media, including animated series and video games. Actor B.J. Novak played Alistair Smythe in the 2014 film The Amazing Spider-Man 2. IGN ranked him as Spider-Mans 9th greatest enemy."

According to the Brookings Institution, Colombo metropolitan area has a population of 5.6 million, and 752,993 in the Municipality. It is the financial centre of the island and a tourist destination. It is located on the west coast of the island and adjacent to the Greater Colombo area which includes Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, the legislative capital of Sri Lanka, and Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia. Colombo is often referred to as the capital since Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte is itself within the urban/suburban area of Colombo. It is also the administrative capital of the Western Province and the district capital of Colombo District. Colombo is a busy and vibrant city with a mixture of modern life, colonial buildings and monuments.Due to its large harbour and its strategic position along the EastWest sea trade routes, Colombo was known to ancient traders 2,000 years ago. It was made the capital of the island when Sri Lanka was ceded to the British Empire in 1815, and its status as capital was retained when the nation became independent in 1948. In 1978, when administrative functions were moved to Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, Colombo was designated as the commercial capital of Sri Lanka.\nLike many cities, Colombos urban area extends well beyond the boundaries of a single local authority, encompassing other municipal and urban councils such as Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte Municipal Council, Dehiwala Mount Lavinia Municipal Council, Kolonnawa Urban Council, Kaduwela Municipal Council, and Kotikawatte Mulleriyawa Pradeshiya Sabha. The main city is home to a majority of Sri Lankas corporate offices, restaurants, and entertainment venues.

Its origin is unknown and has been described by Yale University librarian Fred R. Shapiro as the most prominent etymological riddle of our time.The Oxford English Dictionary finds the earliest published non-idiomatic use in an 1855 Indiana newspaper article. The earliest known idiomatic use of the phrase is from 1907 in Southern Indiana. The phrase is related to the expression the whole six yards, used around the same time in Kentucky and South Carolina. Both phrases are variations on the whole ball of wax, first recorded in the 1880s. They are part of a family of expressions in which an odd-sounding item, such as enchilada, shooting match, shebang or hog, is substituted for ball of wax. The choice of the number nine may be related to the expression To the nines to perfection.\nUse of the phrase became widespread in the 1980s and 1990s. Much of the interest in the phrases etymology can be attributed to New York Times language columnist William Safire, who wrote extensively on this question.\n\n"

            "The Exorcist is a 1973 American supernatural horror film directed by William Friedkin and written for the screen by William Peter Blatty, based on his 1971 novel of the same name. It stars Ellen Burstyn, Max von Sydow, Lee J. Cobb, Kitty Winn, Jack MacGowran in his final film role, Jason Miller and Linda Blair. It follows the demonic possession of a young girl and her mothers attempt to rescue her through an exorcism conducted by a pair of Catholic priests.\nThe book was a bestseller, but Blatty, who also produced, and Friedkin, his choice for director, had difficulty casting the film. Unable to hire major stars of the era, they cast relative unknowns Burstyn, Blair and Miller author of a hit play with no film acting experience, choices vigorously opposed by Warner Brothers executives. Principal photography was also difficult. Friedkin insisted on realism, going to northern Iraq to film the prologue despite political instability in the region, relying on live special effects and casting real priests and medical personnel in the film. Crew also recalled that he was temperamental, often firing people without warning. A fire destroyed most of the set, some crewmembers died, and Blair and Burstyn suffered accidental long-term back injuries; he also deliberately made cast members uncomfortable, going as far as refrigerating the set where the exorcism scenes took place to temperatures well below zero so their breath would be visible. Production took twice as long as scheduled and cost almost three times the initial budget; some deaths and accidents that occurred have led to a belief that the film was cursed.\nThe Exorcist was released in 24 theaters in the United States and Canada in late December 1973. Audiences flocked to it despite mixed reviews, waiting in long lines during winter weather, many more than once; the sold out shows were even more profitable for Warners since they had booked it into those theaters under four wall distribution rental agreements, the first time a major studio had done that. Some viewers suffered adverse physical reactions, fainting or vomiting to scenes in which the protagonist undergoes a realistic cerebral angiography and later violently masturbates with a crucifix. Heart attacks and a miscarriage were reported among viewers; a psychiatric journal published a paper on cinematic neurosis triggered by the film. Many children were allowed to see it, leading to charges that the MPAA ratings board had accommodated Warner Bros by giving the film an R-rating instead of the X-rating they thought it deserved, in order to ensure its commercial success. Several cities attempted to ban it outright or prevent children from attending.\nThe cultural conversation around the film, which also encompassed its treatment of Catholicism and, in the years since, its apparent anti-feminism, helped it become the first horror film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, one of 10 for which it was nominated, and winning for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Sound. It has had several sequels, and was the highest-grossing R-rated horror film unadjusted for inflation until the 2017 release of It. The Exorcist has had a significant influence on popular culture and has received critical acclaim, with several publications regarding it as one of the greatest horror films ever made. In 2010, the Library of Congress selected The Exorcist to be preserved in its National Film Registry, citing it as culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."

Saturday Night Live SNL creator and producer Lorne Michaels asked Samberg to write a musical sketch for the 2006 Christmas episode with Timberlake, who was returning as both host and musical guest. Samberg developed the concept with other members of the group before working with Timberlake on December 14. They recorded the track around midnight and spent the next day and a half filming the corresponding music video.\nThe sketch depicts two early 1990s R&B singers, played by Samberg and Timberlake, singing a holiday song about making a Christmas gift for their girlfriends of their penises in boxes. The sketch premiered on SNL as a Digital Short on December 16, 2006. The word dick was bleeped 16 times following an agreement with the Federal Communications Commission. SNL producers published an uncensored version of the sketch online right after its broadcast debut, a decision criticized by the Parents Television Council. In 2009, the song was released digitally as a single and included on The Lonely Islands debut studio album, Incredibad.\nDick in a Box became a viral hit on the internet, and had generated more than 28 million views on YouTube by October 2007. The song received generally positive reviews from both television and music critics, who praised its raunchy humor and Timberlakes performance. Dick in a Box has been recognized retrospectively as The Lonely Islands signature song and one of the best Christmas-themed SNL sketches. The track won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics in 2007, and appeared on the Australian and Canadian single charts in 2009.

The show debuted on ABC Radio on October 27, 1947, moved to CBS Radio debuting October 5, 1949, and went to NBC-TV and NBC Radio on October 4, 1950. Because of its simple format, it was possible to broadcast the show on both radio and television but not simultaneously. Many of the laughs on the television show were evoked by Grouchos facial reactions and other visual gimmicks; the two versions were slightly different. The last episode in a radio format aired on June 10, 1960. The series continued on television for another year, recording a season on September 22, 1960 with a new title, The Groucho Show.\nGameplay on each episode of You Bet Your Life was generally secondary to Grouchos comedic interplay with contestants and often with Fenneman. The show was so popular that it was the first primetime series to be shown in reruns during the summer months. The common practice at the time was to have a series go on hiatus during the summer, being replaced temporarily by a 13-week comedy or variety series before the main series returned in the fall. The You Bet Your Life summer reruns were broadcast as The Best of Groucho, to make clear to viewers that these were repeat broadcasts.\nAfter the show went off the air, NBC prepared a syndicated version for local stations in 1961. Because the reruns were already established as The Best of Groucho, the syndicated version retained this title. NBC removed all references to the original sponsors by cropping the image whenever the sponsors logo appeared, along with the NBC mark on Grouchos microphone. This is why some shots in the syndicated versions appear grainy and less focused: by deleting the sponsors logo, the image zoomed in on what remained on the screen, sometimes cropping out a contestant while the screen showed only Groucho.\nYou Bet Your Life has been revived three times since the original series ended, the most recent being an ongoing version hosted by Jay Leno that launched in first-run syndication in September 2021.\n\n"

This typically occurs by challenging unique and interesting characters with typical and stereotyped actions that are generally applicable to all people.In the novel Emma, kairosis is developed when an individualistic young woman attempts to play matchmaker to the world. As her personality is challenged by the stereotypical activity of courtship and matchmaking in a young womans life, she experiences a crisis in her character as contradictions within her personality become increasingly antagonistic. When Emma integrates these conflicts, by performing the stereotyped action of completing a successful match, the reader experiences kairosis as Emmas character reaches a moment of synthesis that embodies the previous dialectical contradictions.\nEmmas problem was not to gain a social status of marriage: we are always aware that she will be married by the end of the novel and there is no catharsis experienced as an unexpected climactic action. Rather, we do not know if Emma is worth marrying. This kind of moral-psychological question is at the heart of Austens work, and the modern novel.

The Enlightenment included a range of ideas centered on the value of human happiness, the pursuit of knowledge obtained by means of reason and the evidence of the senses, and ideals such as liberty, progress, toleration, fraternity, and constitutional government.\nThe Enlightenment was preceded by the Scientific Revolution and the work of Francis Bacon, John Locke, and others. Some date the beginning of the Enlightenment to the publication of Ren Descartes Discourse on the Method in 1637, featuring his famous dictum, Cogito, ergo sum I think, therefore I am. Others cite the publication of Isaac Newtons Principia Mathematica 1687 as the culmination of the Scientific Revolution and the beginning of the Enlightenment. European historians traditionally date its beginning with the death of Louis XIV of France in 1715 and its end with the 1789 outbreak of the French Revolution. Many historians now date the end of the Enlightenment as the start of the 19th century, with the latest proposed year being the death of Immanuel Kant in 1804.\nPhilosophers and scientists of the period widely circulated their ideas through meetings at scientific academies, Masonic lodges, literary salons, coffeehouses and in printed books, journals, and pamphlets. The ideas of the Enlightenment undermined the authority of the monarchy and the Catholic Church and paved the way for the political revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries. A variety of 19th-century movements, including liberalism, communism, and neoclassicism, trace their intellectual heritage to the Enlightenment.The central doctrines of the Enlightenment were individual liberty and religious tolerance, in opposition to an absolute monarchy and the fixed dogmas of the Church. The principles of sociability and utility also played an important role in circulating knowledge useful to the improvement of society at large. The Enlightenment was marked by an increasing awareness of the relationship between the mind and the everyday media of the world, and by an emphasis on the scientific method and reductionism, along with increased questioning of religious orthodoxyan attitude captured by Immanuel Kants essay Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment, where the phrase Sapere aude Dare to know can be found."

Her firing was an administration reaction to media reports on video excerpts from her address to an event of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in March 2010 and commentary posted by conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart on his website. Based on these excerpts, the NAACP condemned Sherrods remarks as racist and US government officials called on the official to resign. However, review of her full speech showed that the excerpts had been selectively edited, and that her remarks  understood in context  were about the importance of overcoming personal prejudices. The NAACP and White House officials then apologized for their earlier criticisms, and United States Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack apologized for the firing and offered Sherrod a new position.\nExtensive media coverage of the excerpted videos, various parties comments, and later corrections after the full story was discovered, exacerbated the affair. The event brought to the forefront current debates regarding racism in the United States, cable news reporting, ideological websites on the internet, and decisions made by President Barack Obamas administration.The Obama administration apologized to Sherrod, and offered her a full-time, high-level internal advocacy position with the USDA, which she ultimately declined. In 2011, Sherrod filed suit against Breitbart and co-defendant Larry OConnor for defamation. In 2015, following lengthy pretrial proceedings, Breitbarts death, and efforts by Breitbarts estate to have the suit dismissed which were rejected, the parties settled the suit on undisclosed terms."

            "Eschatology listen; from Ancient Greek  skhatos last, and -logy concerns expectations of the end of the present age, human history, or of the world itself. The end of the world or end times is predicted by several world religions both Abrahamic and non-Abrahamic, which teach that negative world events will reach a climax. Belief that the end of the world is imminent is known as apocalypticism, and over time has been held both by members of mainstream religions and by doomsday cults. In the context of mysticism, the term refers metaphorically to the end of ordinary reality and to reunion with the divine. Various religions treat eschatology as a future event prophesied in sacred texts or in folklore.\nThe Abrahamic religions maintain a linear cosmology, with end-time scenarios containing themes of transformation and redemption. In later Judaism, the term end of days makes reference to the Messianic Age and includes an in-gathering of the exiled Jewish diaspora, the coming of the Messiah, the resurrection of the righteous, and the world to come. Some forms of Christianity depict the end time as a period of tribulation that precedes the second coming of Christ, who will face the rise of the Antichrist along with his power structure and false prophets, and usher in the Kingdom of God. In Islam, the Day of Judgment is preceded by the appearance of the Mas ad-Dajjl, and followed by the descending of s Jesus, which shall triumph over the false Messiah or Antichrist; his defeat will lead to a sequence of events that will end with the sun rising from the west and the beginning of the Qiymah Judgment Day.\nDharmic religions tend to have more cyclical worldviews, with end-time eschatologies characterized by decay, redemption, and rebirth though some believe transitions between cycles are relatively uneventful. In Hinduism, the end time occurs when Kalki, the final incarnation of Vishnu, descends atop a white horse and brings an end to the current Kali Yuga, completing a cycle that starts again with the regeneration of the world. In Buddhism, the Buddha predicted his teachings would be forgotten after 5,000 years, followed by turmoil. It says a bodhisattva named Maitreya will appear and rediscover the teachings of the Buddha Dharma, and that the ultimate destruction of the world will then come through seven suns.\nSince the development of the concept of deep time in the 18th century and the calculation of the estimated age of planet Earth, scientific discourse about end times has considered the ultimate fate of the universe. Theories have included the Big Rip, Big Crunch, Big Bounce, and Big Freeze heat death. Social and scientific commentators also worry about global catastrophic risks and scenarios that could result in human extinction."

The incident kindled the flames of dissatisfaction over the tyrannical methods of Tarquins father, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the last king of Rome. As a result, the prominent families instituted a republic, drove the extensive royal family of Tarquin from Rome, and successfully defended the republic against attempted Etruscan and Latin intervention.There are no contemporary sources of Lucretia and the event. Information regarding Lucretia, her rape and suicide, and the consequence of this being the start of the Roman Republic, come from the accounts of Roman historian Livy and Greco-Roman historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus approximately 500 years later. Secondary sources on the establishment of the republic reiterate the basic events of Lucretias story, though accounts vary slightly between historians. The evidence points to the historical existence of a woman named Lucretia and an event that played a critical part in the downfall of the monarchy. However, specific details are debatable and vary depending on the writer. According to modern sources, Lucretias narrative is considered a part of Roman mythohistory. Much like the rape of the Sabine women, Lucretias story provides an explanation for historical change in Rome through a recounting of sexual assault against women."

The slap was in response to Rocks joke about Smiths wife, Jada Pinkett Smiths shaved head, which she had been shaving since 2021 due to alopecia areata. Smith returned to his seat and shouted profanity at Rock, who briefly responded, but completed his presentation without further interruption.\nLater that evening, Smith won Best Actor and apologized to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and other nominees, but not to Rock, in his acceptance speech. The next day, he issued an apology to Rock and the Academy through social media. Smith resigned his Academy membership on April 1, facing a potential suspension or expulsion, and was banned from attending Academy events for 10 years, effective April 8.\nLive television broadcasts in the United States mostly muted the incident due to federal censorship laws. However, uncensored international footage went viral on social media; an excerpt from the Australian broadcast became one of the most-viewed online videos in the first 24 hours. The incident received worldwide attention and largely overshadowed the rest of the ceremony."

            "A fallacy is the use of invalid or otherwise faulty reasoning, or wrong moves, in the construction of an argument which may appear stronger than it really is if the fallacy is not spotted. The term in the Western intellectual tradition was introduced in the Aristotelian De Sophisticis Elenchis.Some fallacies may be committed intentionally to manipulate or persuade by deception. Others may be committed unintentionally because of human limitations such as carelessness, cognitive or social biases and ignorance, or, potentially, as the inevitable consequence of the limitations of language and understanding of language. This includes ignorance of the right reasoning standard, but also ignorance of relevant properties of the context. For instance, the soundness of legal arguments depends on the context in which the arguments are made.Fallacies are commonly divided into formal and informal. A formal fallacy is a flaw in the structure of a deductive argument which renders the argument invalid, while an informal fallacy originates in an error in reasoning other than an improper logical form. Arguments containing informal fallacies may be formally valid, but still fallacious.A special case is a mathematical fallacy, an intentionally invalid mathematical proof, often with the error subtle and somehow concealed. Mathematical fallacies are typically crafted and exhibited for educational purposes, usually taking the form of false proofs of obvious contradictions."

Some modern editions use a revised version printed in 1817 that featured a gloss. Along with other poems in Lyrical Ballads, it is often considered a signal shift to modern poetry and the beginning of British Romantic literature.\n\nThe Rime of the Ancient Mariner recounts the experiences of a sailor who has returned from a long sea voyage. The mariner stops a man who is on his way to a wedding ceremony and begins to narrate a story. The Wedding-Guests reaction turns from bemusement to impatience to fear to fascination as the mariners story progresses, as can be seen in the language style: Coleridge uses narrative techniques such as personification and repetition to create a sense of danger, the supernatural, or serenity, depending on the mood in different parts of the poem.\n\n"

His work is characterized by nonconformity, free-form improvisation, sound experiments, musical virtuosity and satire of American culture. In a career spanning more than 30 years, Zappa composed rock, pop, jazz, jazz fusion, orchestral and musique concrte works, and produced almost all of the 60-plus albums that he released with his band the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. Zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos, and designed album covers. He is considered one of the most innovative and stylistically diverse musicians of his generation.As a self-taught composer and performer, Zappa had diverse musical influences that led him to create music that was sometimes difficult to categorize. While in his teens, he acquired a taste for 20th-century classical modernism, African-American rhythm and blues, and doo-wop music. He began writing classical music in high school, while at the same time playing drums in rhythm-and-blues bands, later switching to electric guitar. His 1966 debut album with the Mothers of Invention, Freak Out!, combined songs in conventional rock and roll format with collective improvisations and studio-generated sound collages. He continued this eclectic and experimental approach whether the fundamental format was rock, jazz, or classical.\nZappas output is unified by a conceptual continuity he termed Project/Object, with numerous musical phrases, ideas, and characters reappearing across his albums. His lyrics reflected his iconoclastic views of established social and political processes, structures and movements, often humorously so, and he has been described as the godfather of comedy rock. He was a strident critic of mainstream education and organized religion, and a forthright and passionate advocate for freedom of speech, self-education, political participation and the abolition of censorship. Unlike many other rock musicians of his generation, he disapproved of recreational drug use, but supported decriminalization and regulation.\nZappa was a highly productive and prolific artist with a controversial critical standing; supporters of his music admired its compositional complexity, while detractors found it lacking emotional depth. He had greater commercial success outside the US, particularly in Europe. Though he worked as an independent artist, Zappa mostly relied on distribution agreements he had negotiated with the major record labels. He remains a major influence on musicians and composers. His many honors include his 1995 posthumous induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the 1997 Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award."

            "A psychic is a person who claims to use extrasensory perception ESP to identify information hidden from the normal senses, particularly involving telepathy or clairvoyance, or who performs acts that are apparently inexplicable by natural laws, such as psychokinesis or teleportation. Although many people believe in psychic abilities, the scientific consensus is that there is no proof of the existence of such powers, and describes the practice as pseudoscience. The word psychic is also used as an adjective to describe such abilities.\nPsychics encompass people in a variety of roles. Some are theatrical performers, such as stage magicians, who use various techniques, e.g., prestidigitation, cold reading, and hot reading, to produce the appearance of such abilities for entertainment purposes. A large industry and network exists whereby people advertised as psychics provide advice and counsel to clients. Some famous psychics include Edgar Cayce, Ingo Swann, Peter Hurkos, Janet Lee, Jose Ortiz El Samaritano, Miss Cleo, John Edward, Sylvia Browne, and Tyler Henry. Psychic powers are asserted by psychic detectives and in practices such as psychic archaeology and even psychic surgery.Critics attribute psychic powers to intentional trickery or to self-delusion. In 1988 the U.S. National Academy of Sciences gave a report on the subject and concluded there is no scientific justification from research conducted over a period of 130 years for the existence of parapsychological phenomena. A study attempted to repeat recently reported parapsychological experiments that appeared to support the existence of precognition. Attempts to repeat the results, which involved performance on a memory test to ascertain if post-test information would affect it, failed to produce significant effects and thus do not support the existence of psychic ability of this kind.Psychics are sometimes featured in science fiction and fantasy fiction. Examples of fiction featuring characters with psychic powers include the Star Wars franchise, which features Force-sensitive beings who can see into the future and move objects telekinetically, along with Dungeons & Dragons and some of the works of Stephen King, amongst many others."

Breca is also mentioned in Widsith, an Anglo-Saxon poem also known, usually by the translations of Benjamin Thorpe, as The Skp, or The Gleemas Tale, or The Skalds Tale known only from a 10th-century copy, as the ruler in some unspecified previous century of the Brondings line 25 of Widsith:\n\n Cassere weold Creacum, ond Caelic Finnum, ..

            "Donald Trump (Last Week Tonight with John Oliver)",
            "Donald Trump is a segment of the HBO news satire television series Last Week Tonight with John Oliver that is devoted to Donald Trump, who later became the president of the United States. It first aired on February 28, 2016, as part of the third episode of Last Week Tonights third season, when Trump was the frontrunner for the Republican Party nomination for the presidency. During the 22-minute segment, comedian John Oliver discusses Trumps 2016 presidential campaign and his career in business. Oliver outlines Trumps campaign rhetoric, varying political positions, and failed business ventures. The comedian also criticizes Trump for making offensive and false statements, and says the Trump family name was changed at one point from the ancestral name Drumpf.\nThe satirical segment went viral on YouTube and Facebook. By Super Tuesday on March 1, two days after broadcast, Google searches for Donald Drumpf had surpassed those for both Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, who were then competing against Trump for the Republican Party nomination. In eight days, the segment accumulated 19 million views on YouTube, making it Last Week Tonights most popular segment there. By the end of March, it had received a combined 85 million views on YouTube and Facebook.\nThe segment popularized the term Donald Drumpf, a name for Trump that Oliver uses toward the end of the segment. Oliver intended the term to uncouple the grandeur of the Trump name so the latters supporters could acknowledge his political and entrepreneurial flaws. The comedian promoted a campaign urging viewers to Make Donald Drumpf Again, a play on Trumps Make America Great Again campaign slogan. Oliver coined a hashtag and registered a web domain to promote the term; the website offered a Google Chrome extension to change instances of Trump to Drumpf and sold baseball caps with the slogan Make Donald Drumpf Again.\nThe segment started a public debate on when the Trump family renamed themselves from Drumpf. Commentators debated whether the family changed their name in the 17th or 19th century but agreed that neither Donald Trump nor his father Fred ever carried the surname Drumpf. Reviews of the segment itself were mixed: some praised the segment for being funny and informational, but others criticized Oliver for the possible xenophobic undertones attached to mocking the Drumpf surname. Oliver stopped using the name Drumpf in subsequent segments, saying the joke went out of hand."

Metafiction is self-conscious about language, literary form, and story-telling, and works of metafiction directly or indirectly draw attention to their status as artifacts. Metafiction is frequently used as a form of parody or a tool to undermine literary conventions and explore the relationship between literature and reality, life, and art.Although metafiction is most commonly associated with postmodern literature that developed in the mid-20th century, its use can be traced back to much earlier works of fiction, such as The Canterbury Tales Geoffrey Chaucer, 1387, Don Quixote Miguel de Cervantes, 1605, The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman Laurence Sterne, 1759, and Vanity Fair William Makepeace Thackeray, 1847. \nMetafiction became particularly prominent in the 1960s, with works such as Lost in the Funhouse by John Barth, The Babysitter and The Magic Poker by Robert Coover, Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut, The French Lieutenants Woman by John Fowles, The Crying of Lot 49 by Thomas Pynchon, and Willie Masters Lonesome Wife by William H. Gass.\nSince the 1980s, contemporary Latino literature has an abundance of self-reflexive, metafictional works, including novels and short stories by Junot Daz The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, Sandra Cisneros Caramelo, Salvador Plascencia The People of Paper, Carmen Maria Machado Her Body, Rita Indiana Tentacle, and Valeria Luiselli Lost Children Archive.\n\n"

The period is noted for the change from absolutist monarchies to representative governments with a written constitution, and the creation of nation states.\nInfluenced by the new ideas of the Enlightenment, the American Revolution 17651783 is usually considered the starting point of the Age of Revolution. It in turn inspired the French Revolution of 1789, which rapidly spread to the rest of Europe through its wars. In 1799, Napoleon took power in France and continued the French Revolutionary Wars by conquering most of continental Europe. Although Napoleon imposed on his conquests several modern concepts such as equality before the law, or a civil code, his rigorous military occupation triggered national rebellions, notably in Spain and Germany. After Napoleons defeat, European great powers forged the Holy Alliance at the Congress of Vienna in 181415, in an attempt to prevent future revolutions, and also restored the previous monarchies. Nevertheless, Spain was considerably weakened by the Napoleonic Wars and could not control its American colonies, almost all of which proclaimed their independence between 1810 and 1820. Revolution then spread back to southern Europe in 1820, with uprisings in Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Greece. Continental Europe was shaken by two similar revolutionary waves in 1830 and 1848, also called the Spring of Nations. The democratic demands of the revolutionaries often merged with independence or national unification movements, such as in Italy, Germany, Poland, Hungary, etc. The violent repression of the Spring of Nations marked the end of the era.\nThe expression was popularized by the British historian Eric Hobsbawm in his book The Age of Revolution: Europe 17891848, published in 1962."

Frank Baums 1900 childrens fantasy novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the film was primarily directed by Victor Fleming who left the production to take over the troubled Gone with the Wind, and stars Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley, Billie Burke and Margaret Hamilton. Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson, and Edgar Allan Woolf received credit for the screenplay, but others made uncredited contributions. The music was composed by Harold Arlen and adapted by Herbert Stothart, with the lyrics written by Edgar Yip Harburg.\nCharacterized by its use of Technicolor, fantasy storytelling, musical score, and memorable characters, The Wizard of Oz was moderately successful upon its original release of August 25, 1939. The film was considered a critical success and was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, winning in two categories: Best Original Song for Over the Rainbow and Best Original Score by Stothart. While the film was sufficiently popular at the box office, it failed to make a profit for MGM until the 1949 re-release, earning only $3,017,000 on a $2,777,000 budget, not including promotional costs, which made it MGMs most expensive production at that time.The 1956 television broadcast premiere of the film on the CBS network reintroduced the film to the public; according to the U.S. Library of Congress, it is the most seen film in movie history. In 1989, it was selected by the Library of Congress as one of the first 25 films for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant. It is also one of the few films on UNESCOs Memory of the World Register. The film was ranked second in Varietys inaugural 100 Greatest Movies of All Time list published in 2022.

The serio-comic style became a rhetorical mainstay of the Cynics. It was also used by the Pyrrhonist philosopher Timon of Phlius. The Romans gave it its own genre in the form of satire, contributed to most notably by the poets Horace and Juvenal. It was the most common tone of the works made by Menippus and Meleager of Gadara."

Wilson ultimately scrapped Smile and reduced his involvement with the group.\n\nWilson later said that the genius branding intensified the pressures of his career and led him to become a victim of the recording industry. As he shied away from the industry in the years afterward, his ensuing legend originated the trope of the reclusive genius among studio-oriented musical artists and later inspired comparisons between other musicians such as Pink Floyds Syd Barrett and My Bloody Valentines Kevin Shields."

            "History of citizenship describes the changing relation between an individual and the state, known as citizenship. Citizenship is generally identified not as an aspect of Eastern civilization but of Western civilization. There is a general view that citizenship in ancient times was a simpler relation than modern forms of citizenship, although this view has been challenged.While there is disagreement about when the relation of citizenship began, many thinkers point to the early city-states of ancient Greece, possibly as a reaction to the fear of slavery, although others see it as primarily a modern phenomenon dating back only a few hundred years. In Roman times, citizenship began to take on more of the character of a relationship based on law, with less political participation than in ancient Greece but a widening sphere of who was considered to be a citizen. In the Middle Ages in Europe, citizenship was primarily identified with commercial and secular life in the growing cities, and it came to be seen as membership in emerging nation-states. In modern democracies, citizenship has contrasting senses, including a liberal-individualist view emphasizing needs and entitlements and legal protections for essentially passive political beings, and a civic-republican view emphasizing political participation and seeing citizenship as an active relation with specific privileges and obligations.\nWhile citizenship has varied considerably throughout history, there are some common elements of citizenship over time. Citizenship bonds extend beyond basic kinship ties to unite people of different genetic backgrounds, that is, citizenship is more than a clan or extended kinship network. It generally describes the relation between a person and an overall political entity such as a city-state or nation and signifies membership in that body. It is often based on, or a function of, some form of military service or expectation of future military service. It is generally characterized by some form of political participation, although the extent of such participation can vary considerably from minimal duties such as voting to active service in government. And citizenship, throughout history, has often been seen as an ideal state, closely allied with freedom, an important status with legal aspects including rights, and it has sometimes been seen as a bundle of rights or a right to have rights. Last, citizenship almost always has had an element of exclusion, in the sense that citizenship derives meaning, in part, by excluding non-citizens from basic rights and privileges.\n\n"

The other party, generally identified as Canadian or often Irish and occasionally Spanish lighthouse keepers responds that the naval vessel should change course, whereupon the captain of the naval vessel reiterates the demand, identifying himself and the ship he commands and sometimes making threats. This elicits a response worded as Im a lighthouse. Your call or similarly, a punchline which has become shorthand for the entire anecdote.\nIt has circulated on the Internet and elsewhere in particular since a 1995 iteration that was represented as an actual transcript of such a communication released by the office of the U.S. Chief of Naval Operations. There appears to be no evidence that the event actually took place, and the account is implausible for several reasons. It is thus considered an urban legend, a variation on a joke that dates to at least the 1930s, sometimes referred to as the lighthouse vs. the carrier or the lighthouse vs. the battleship. The U.S. Navy once had a webpage debunking it, although this did not stop the former U.S. Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell using it as a joke in a 2008 speech. Other speakers have often used it simply as a parable teaching the dangers of inflexibility and self-importance, or the need for situational awareness.

Bale was filming with actress Bryce Dallas Howard when he berated director of photography, Shane Hurlbut, for walking into his line of sight. An audio recording of the incident appeared on website TMZ on February 2, 2009. The Mae Shi composed and recorded the song later in the same day, and released it the next day. The group stated that the piece was created to honor Bale. The song parodies Bale by sampling his voice from the 2008 diatribe. The chorus incorporates Bales use of the word professional from his flare-up. The lyrics reference several films the actor starred in, including Newsies, Swing Kids, American Psycho, and The Dark Knight.\nThe song was made available on YouTube and via download on MediaFire the next day. R U Professional received a generally positive reception, and was praised as an effective parody of Bales on-set disturbance. MTV compared its style to new wave groups like Devo. The Los Angeles Times described it as a lively pop music tribute to the actor. USA Today categorized the song as fun dance music and called it creatively motivated. The Toronto Sun wrote positively of its creative lyrics and use of audio from the Bale oration. El Pas classed the piece as an electropop song that contributed to the viral spread of the Bale rant online. Dose placed the song within the genre of an electro jam session. Publications including The A.V. Club and Pitchfork Media were impressed with the groups ability to compose and release the song twenty-four hours after the audio of the incident appeared online. The Irish Independent wrote that they thought the group may have used a melody they already had and adapted it for the song to release it so quickly."

Very little material and textual evidence survives from this period. The earliest archaeological evidence at Assur dates to the Early Dynastic Period, c. 2600 BC, but the city may have been founded even earlier since the area had been inhabited for thousands of years prior and other nearby cities, such as Nineveh, are significantly older.\nThe archaeological evidence suggests that Assur was originally inhabited by Hurrians and was the site of a fertility cult devoted to the goddess Ishtar. The name Assur is not historically attested prior to the age of the Akkadian Empire in the 24th century BC; it is possible that the city was originally named Baltil, used in later times to refer to its oldest portion. At some point before the rise of the Akkadian Empire, the Semitic-speaking ancestors of the later Assyrians settled in Assur and the surrounding area, either displacing or assimilating the original population. Founded in a both holy and strategic location, the city itself was gradually deified during the Early Assyrian period and eventually became personified as the god Ashur, firmly established as the Assyrian national deity by the time of Puzur-Ashur I.\nThere is no evidence that Assur was independent at any point in the Early Assyrian period. Throughout the centuries prior to Puzur-Ashur I, it is instead evident that the city was dominated by a sequence of powerful states and empires from southern Mesopotamia. In the Early Dynastic Period, Assur experienced considerable Sumerian influence, and for a time fell under the hegemony of the Sumerian city of Kish. In the 24th to 22nd centuries BC, the city was part of the Akkadian Empire as an administrative outpost in northern Mesopotamia, a time later Assyrian kings saw as a golden age. In the final geopolitical stage preceding Assurs independence, the city became a peripheral city within the Sumerian empire of the Third Dynasty of Ur c. 21122004 BC.\n\n"

It represents the first advanced and distinctively Greek civilization in mainland Greece with its palatial states, urban organization, works of art, and writing system. The Mycenaeans were mainland Greek peoples who were likely stimulated by their contact with insular Minoan Crete and other Mediterranean cultures to develop a more sophisticated sociopolitical culture of their own. The most prominent site was Mycenae, after which the culture of this era is named. Other centers of power that emerged included Pylos, Tiryns, Midea in the Peloponnese, Orchomenos, Thebes, Athens in Central Greece and Iolcos in Thessaly. Mycenaean settlements also appeared in Epirus, Macedonia, on islands in the Aegean Sea, on the south-west coast of Asia Minor, Cyprus, while Mycenaean-influenced settlements appeared in the Levant, and Italy.The Mycenaean Greeks introduced several innovations in the fields of engineering, architecture and military infrastructure, while trade over vast areas of the Mediterranean was essential for the Mycenaean economy. Their syllabic script, the Linear B, offers the first written records of the Indo-European Greek language, and their religion already included several deities that can also be found in the Olympic Pantheon. Mycenaean Greece was dominated by a warrior elite society and consisted of a network of palace-centered states that developed rigid hierarchical, political, social and economic systems. At the head of this society was the king, known as a wanax.\nMycenaean Greece perished with the collapse of Bronze Age culture in the eastern Mediterranean, to be followed by the Greek Dark Ages, a recordless transitional period leading to Archaic Greece where significant shifts occurred from palace-centralized to de-centralized forms of socio-economic organization including the extensive use of iron. Various theories have been proposed for the end of this civilization, among them the Dorian invasion or activities connected to the Sea Peoples. Additional theories such as natural disasters and climatic changes have also been suggested. The Mycenaean period became the historical setting of much ancient Greek literature and mythology, including the Trojan Epic Cycle."

Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, it is based on accounts of the sinking of the RMS Titanic and stars Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage. Also starring are Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, and Bill Paxton.\nCamerons inspiration for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks; he felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began on September 1, 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the actual Titanic wreck. The modern scenes on the research vessel were shot on board the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. Scale models, computer-generated imagery, and a reconstruction of the Titanic built at Baja Studios were used to re-create the sinking. The film was co-financed by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; the former handled distribution in North America while the latter released the film internationally. It was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200 million. Filming took place from July 1996 to March 1997.\nUpon its release on December 19, 1997, Titanic achieved significant critical and commercial success, and then received numerous accolades. It was praised for its visual effects, performances particularly DiCaprio, Winslet, and Stuart, production values, Camerons direction, musical score, cinematography, story, and emotional depth. Nominated for 14 Academy Awards, it tied All About Eve 1950 for the most Oscar nominations, and won 11, including the awards for Best Picture and Best Director, tying Ben-Hur 1959 for the most Oscars won by a single film. With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, Titanic was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark. It remained the highest-grossing film of all time until another Cameron film, Avatar, surpassed it in 2010. A 3D re-release version of Titanic, released on April 4, 2012, to commemorate the centennial of the sinking, earned it an additional $343.6 million worldwide, pushing the films worldwide total to $2.195 billion and making it the second film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide after Avatar. In 2017, the film was re-released for its 20th anniversary and was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being culturally, historically or aesthetically significant."

Thirty-nine local authorities in the United Kingdom either imposed an outright ban, or imposed an X 18 years certificate. Some countries, including Ireland and Norway, banned its showing, and in a few of these, such as Italy, bans lasted decades.

The short marks the final appearance of Elmer Fudd in a Chuck Jones cartoon.\nIt has been widely praised by many in the animation industry as the greatest animated cartoon that Warner Bros. ever released, and has been ranked as such in the top 50 animated cartoons of all time. In 1992, the Library of Congress deemed it culturally, historically or aesthetically significant, and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry, the first cartoon short to receive such honors."

It tells the story of Elliott, a boy who befriends an extraterrestrial, dubbed E.T., who is left behind on Earth. Along with his friends and family, Elliott must find a way to help E.T. find his way home. The film stars Dee Wallace, Henry Thomas, Peter Coyote, Robert MacNaughton and Drew Barrymore.\nThe films concept was based on an imaginary friend that Spielberg created after his parents divorce. In 1980, Spielberg met Mathison and developed a new story from the unrealized project Night Skies. In less than two months, Mathison wrote the first draft of the script, titled E.T. and Me, which went through two rewrites. The project was rejected by Columbia Pictures, who doubted its commercial potential. Universal Pictures eventually purchased the script for $1 million. Filming took place from September to December 1981 on a budget of $10.5 million. Unlike most films, E.T. was shot in rough chronological order to facilitate convincing emotional performances from the young cast. The animatronics for the film were designed by Carlo Rambaldi.\nE.T. premiered as the closing film of the Cannes Film Festival on May 26, 1982, and was released in the United States on June 11, 1982. The film was an immediate blockbuster, surpassing Star Wars to become the highest-grossing film of all time, a record it held for eleven years until Spielbergs own Jurassic Park surpassed it in 1993. E.T. was widely acclaimed by critics, and is regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. It received nine nominations at the 55th Academy Awards, winning Best Original Score, Best Visual Effects, Best Sound, and Best Sound Editing, and also won five Saturn Awards and two Golden Globe Awards. The film was re-released in 1985 and again in 2002 to celebrate its 20th anniversary, with altered shots, visual effects, and additional scenes. It was also re-released in IMAX on August 12, 2022, to celebrate its 40th anniversary. In 1994, the film was added to the United States National Film Registry of the Library of Congress, who deemed it culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."

            "Horror Victorianorum terror of the Victorian, coined by the philosopher David Stove, is an extreme distaste or condemnation of Victorian culture, art and design. The term was used in Stoves book The Plato Cult as part of his argument against Karl Popper and other philosophers whom he characterised as modernists. For Stove, Popper was influenced by the pervasive anti-Victorian mentality of the era, epitomised by Evelyn Waughs book A Handful of Dust, in which the absurdity of Victorian values is expressed by a parody of Victorian conceptions of the civilizing mission of imperialism, when the hero is finally trapped in the Amazonian jungle, forced eternally to read the works of Dickens to a tribal chief.\nFor Stove, the ascription of absurdity to Victorian culture was essentially a matter of taste, but one so powerful and irrational that it possessed the intensity of religious faith. As a result, it produced a revulsion  rather than a reasoned scepticism  to writers such as the Victorian philosopher of science William Whewell.\nFollowing Stoves usage, the term was taken up by the design historian Shelagh Wilson to refer to modernist distaste for Victorian architecture and design. Wilson argued that Palissyite design, influenced by the methods of Bernard Palissy, had been ridiculed and misunderstood by proponents of Puginite design, following the proto-modernist principles of Augustus Pugin. Wilsons argument formed part of a reaffirmation of the aesthetic principles of the grotesque.\nThe argument that distaste for Victorian cultural values Anti-victorianism is irrational has been adopted by other writers,1either following Stoves politically conservative attack on liberal thought, or Wilsons critique of modernism."

            "The Elizabethan era is the epoch in the Tudor period of the history of England during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I 15581603. Historians often depict it as the golden age in English history. The symbol of Britannia a female personification of Great Britain was first used in 1572, and often thereafter, to mark the Elizabethan age as a renaissance that inspired national pride through classical ideals, international expansion, and naval triumph over Spain.\nThis golden age represented the apogee of the English Renaissance and saw the flowering of poetry, music and literature. The era is most famous for its theatre, as William Shakespeare and many others composed plays that broke free of Englands past style of theatre. It was an age of exploration and expansion abroad, while back at home, the Protestant Reformation became more acceptable to the people, most certainly after the Spanish Armada was repelled. It was also the end of the period when England was a separate realm before its royal union with Scotland.\nThe Elizabethan age contrasts sharply with the previous and following reigns. It was a brief period of internal peace between the Wars of the Roses in the previous century, the English Reformation, and the religious battles between Protestants and Catholics prior to Elizabeths reign, and then the later conflict of the English Civil War and the ongoing political battles between parliament and the monarchy that engulfed the remainder of the seventeenth century. The Protestant/Catholic divide was settled, for a time, by the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, and parliament was not yet strong enough to challenge royal absolutism.\nEngland was also well-off compared to the other nations of Europe. The Italian Renaissance had come to an end following the end of the Italian Wars, which left the Italian Peninsula impoverished. The Kingdom of France was embroiled in the French Wars of Religion 15621598. They were temporarily settled in 1598 by a policy of tolerating Protestantism with the Edict of Nantes. In part because of this, but also because the English had been expelled from their last outposts on the continent by Spains tercios, the centuries-long Anglo-French Wars were largely suspended for most of Elizabeths reign.\nThe one great rival was Habsburg Spain, with whom England clashed both in Europe and the Americas in skirmishes that exploded into the Anglo-Spanish War of 15851604. An attempt by Philip II of Spain to invade England with the Spanish Armada in 1588 was famously defeated. In turn England launched an equally unsuccessful expedition to Spain with the DrakeNorris Expedition of 1589. Three further Spanish Armadas also failed in 1596, 1597 and 1602. The war ended with the Treaty of London the year following Elizabeths death.\nEngland during this period had a centralised, well-organised, and effective government, largely a result of the reforms of Henry VII and Henry VIII, as well as Elizabeths harsh punishments for any dissenters. Economically, the country began to benefit greatly from the new era of trans-Atlantic trade and persistent theft of Spanish and Portuguese treasures, most notably as a result of Francis Drakes circumnavigation.\nThe term Elizabethan era was already well-established in English and British historical consciousness, long before the accession of Queen Elizabeth II, and generally refers solely to the time of the earlier Queen of this name.\n\n"

            "To rob Peter to pay Paul",
            "To rob Peter to pay Paul, or other versions that have developed over the centuries such as to borrow from Peter to pay Paul, and to unclothe Peter to clothe Paul, are phrases meaning to take from one person or thing to give to another, especially when it results in the elimination of one debt by incurring another. There are many other variants and similar phrases in numerous languages. Maneuvering the Apostles, which has the same meaning, was derived from this expression. In patchwork, Rob Peter to pay Paul is an alternative name for the Drunkards Path patchwork block.English folklore has it that the phrase alludes to an event in mid-16th century England in which the abbey church of Saint Peter, Westminster was deemed a cathedral by letters patent; but ten years later it was absorbed into the diocese of London when the diocese of Westminster was dissolved, and a few years after that many of its assets were expropriated for repairs to Saint Pauls Cathedral. However, the phrase was popular even before that, dating back to at least the late 14th century.This phrase may have originated in Middle English as a collocation of common names  similar to, for example, Tom, Dick, and Harry  with the religious connotations accruing later, or alternatively as a reference to Saint Peter and Saint Paul who are often depicted jointly in Christian art and regarded similarly in theology. One reason for the frequent use of the two names in expressions is the alliteration they form. The aforementioned Peter and Paul were apostles of Christ; both were martyred in ancient Rome and have the same feast day i.e. the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul on June 29th. Today, the feast occurs with minimal notice, but it was widely celebrated within England in the Middle Ages. Many churches there were dedicated to the pair. All of that, combined with the medieval English people being almost universally Christian, made it quite common to hear these names together. The expression was coined at a time when almost all English people were Christian and they would have been well used to hearing Peter and Paul paired together.Robbing selected Peter to pay for collective Paul is Rudyard Kiplings adaptation of the phrase, used to criticize the concepts of income redistribution and collectivism. Kipling included the expression in his Gods of the Copybook Headings, and proposed that it should be featured in catechisms of the Conservative Campaign Headquarters. The lesson of the phrase in his version, and of the poem in general, was that only out of the savings of the thrifty can be made the wage-fund to set other men on the way to be prosperous."

The books are short stories with colorful illustrations that have a moral perspective.\nCosgrove wrote the books after searching for an easy to read book with a message to read to his then three-year-old daughter. After finding primarily large expensive books, Cosgrove teamed up with illustrator James to create low cost softcover books. After receiving an offer to publish the books only in hardcover, Cosgrove created his own publishing company - Serendipity Press. The first four books of the Serendipity Series were released in December of 1973. They are: Serendipity, The Dream Tree, Wheedle on the Needle, and The Muffin Muncher. Cosgrove merged Serendipity Press with the publishing company, Price/Stern/Sloan now part of Penguin Random House in 1978 so that Cosgrove could focus on writing. Cosgrove decided to re-edit his earlier books, which have been republished with the changes. To date, there are 70 books in the series, written from the kindergarten to grade three levels.The animals in the Serendipity series include bears, cats, dogs, horses, squirrels, rabbits, and mythical creatures such as unicorns, dragons, sea monsters, and pegasus. Cosgrove also invented his own creatures such as the wheedle, hucklebug and kritter. The books present moral issues such as growing up, disabilities, abuse, fear, friendship, prejudice, gossip, and helping the environment.The book series was adapted into a 26-episode anime series entitled Serendipity the Pink Dragon and 26-episode cartoon series Little Mouse on the Prairie.\nAt least 25 of the books were translated into Spanish based on the list in El Dragon Gloton and at least 6 in Italian by Arnoldo Mondadori Editore."

Five dynastic states quickly succeeded one another in the Central Plain, and more than a dozen concurrent dynastic states were established elsewhere, mainly in South China. It was a prolonged period of multiple political divisions in Chinese imperial history.Traditionally, the era is seen as beginning with the fall of the Tang dynasty in 907 and reaching its climax with the founding of the Song dynasty in 960. In the following 19 years, Song gradually subdued the remaining states in South China, but the Liao dynasty still remained in Chinas north eventually succeeded by the Jin dynasty, and the Western Xia was eventually established in Chinas northwest.\nMany states had been de facto independent long before 907 as the Tang dynastys control over its officials waned, but the key event was their recognition as sovereign by foreign powers. After the Tang collapsed, several warlords of the Central Plain crowned themselves emperor. During the 70-year period, there was near constant warfare between the emerging kingdoms and alliances they formed. All had the ultimate goal of controlling the Central Plain and establishing themselves as the Tangs successor.\nThe last of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms regimes was Northern Han, which held out until Song conquered it in 979. For the next several centuries, although the Song controlled much of South China, they coexisted alongside the Liao dynasty, Jin dynasty, and various other regimes in Chinas north, until finally all of them were unified under the Yuan dynasty."

Walt became a high-school chemistry teacher in Albuquerque, and barely \nmaking ends meet with his family with wife Skyler Anna Gunn and son Walt Jr. RJ Mitte. At the start of the series, the day after his 50th birthday, Walt is diagnosed with Stage III lung cancer. After this discovery, Walt resorts to manufacturing and selling methamphetamine with a former student, Jesse Pinkman Aaron Paul, to ensure his familys financial security after his death. Due to his chemistry training and production route, Walts blue meth is purer than any other on the market, and he is pulled deeper into the illicit drug trade. \nWalt becomes increasingly ruthless as the series progresses, and later adopts the alias Heisenberg, which becomes recognizable as a kingpin figure in the Southwestern drug trade. Walt struggles with managing his family while hiding his involvement in the drug business from his brother-in-law and DEA agent Hank Schrader Dean Norris. Walt becomes less sympathetic throughout the show, as series creator Vince Gilligan wanted him to turn from Mr. Chips into Scarface. Although AMC officials initially hesitated to cast Cranston due to his previous comedic role on Malcolm in the Middle, Gilligan cast him based on the actors past performance in The X-Files episode Drive, which Gilligan wrote. Cranston contributed greatly to the creation of his character, including Walts backstory, personality, and physical appearance.\nOne of the most iconic characters in popular culture, Walter White has been listed among the greatest villains and fictional characters ever created. Both the character and Cranstons performance have received critical acclaim, with White frequently being mentioned as one of the greatest and most iconic television characters of all time. Cranston won four Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, three of them being consecutive. He is the first man to win a Critics Choice, Golden Globe, Primetime Emmy, and Screen Actors Guild Award for his performance. Cranston reprised the role of Walt in a flashback for Breaking Bads sequel film El Camino, and again in the sixth and final season of the prequel series Better Call Saul, making him one of the few characters to appear in all three, alongside Jesse Pinkman, Mike Ehrmantraut Jonathan Banks, Ed Galbraith Robert Forster, and Austin Ramey Todd Terry."

Like John Henry, the character may have been based on a real person. Stories of Annie Christmas have been included in several collections of folktales from the Southern United States.In his book The Gangs of New Orleans, Herbert Asbury states that Annie Christmas was originally a white New Orleans woman and white folk hero, who became a demigod among the Negroes who presented her as black. He writes that In the white version of the Annie Christmas saga, she was murdered in a New Orleans gambling-house, but Negro tradition permits no such commonplace end. The Negroes have it that she killed herself for love. The stories describe how she defies traditional gender hierarchies and the rules and expectations for female behavior. She drinks exorbitant amounts of liquor and dominates men who challenge her authority. She wears a pearl necklace, and each pearl represents the defeat of someone who has unsuccessfully challenged her. Though unmarried, she has twelve sons who work as her crewmen on the keelboat. In one tale of her death she was attacked by 100 men who shot and stabbed her.The novel 1993: Free Enterprise: A Novel of Mary Ellen Pleasant by Jamaican Author Michelle Cliff includes a character named Annie Christmas, probably inspired by the folktale character."

The legend refers to a black or in some versions red GAZ-21 or GAZ-24 that was allegedly used to abduct and murder people. According to different versions, it was driven by communist secret police, Russian mafia, Satanists or Satan himself. The car is described as having white wheel rims, white curtains or other white elements.\n\nThis impression was also caused by the active use of the passenger car of the Gorky Automobile Plant GAZ-M1 Emka by the NKVD bodies during the years of mass repression. For the sake of saving money, during almost all the time of its release, the M1 was only available with black paint, which emphasized the ominous image of the car.Supposedly, victims were kidnapped and then murdered by the perpetrators to use their blood as a cure for rich Westerners or Arabs suffering from leukemia. Other variants used organ theft as the motive, combing it with another infamous legend of kidney theft by the KGB. The legend surfaced again in the late 20th century, with a BMW or Mercedes car taking the Volgas place. The Black Volga was sometimes depicted with horns instead of wing mirrors. It could also have the number 666 on the license plate, as well as having white windows or curtains. In this version, the driver allegedly the devil would ask passers-by for the time and kill them when they approached the car to answer. In another version of the legend, the victim would die at the same time a day later the driver would say: Tomorrow you will die at this hour. However, there was an effective defence methodwhenever the driver of the Black Volga asked What time is it?, the person would have to answer It is Gods time. Then the car would quickly vanish. \nIn Czechoslovakia, the story appeared in the late 1970s as the black ambulance, while in Romania, the Volgas were replaced in the 1970s with Dacia 1301s, a modified version of the Dacia 1300 with several features not available to the public, which were eventually replaced by ambulances as well in the 1990s."

Since its original release on Bringing It All Back Home, live versions of the song have been issued on The Bootleg Series Vol. 6: Bob Dylan Live 1964, Concert at Philharmonic Hall, Before the Flood, The Rolling Thunder Revue: The 1975 Live Recordings, and Bob Dylan at Budokan.

The church believes its foundation by Jesus marks the end-times, because Judaism believes that the messiah will come in the end-times. While the church accepts much of the Jewish interpretation of the Old Testament - the existence of God, divine inspiration, the exodus to the promised land, Babylonian captivity, etc. - the church does not agree with everything Judaism believes. The church interprets many scriptural events literally whereas Judaism interprets them symbolically, applies the messianic prophecies to Jesus whereas Judaism discounts certain scriptural verses as messianic prophecies and rejects Jesus claims to messiahship and divinity, and applies Jewish self-identity to the church. For example, where Judaism believes that the world was created for the sake of Israel, the church teaches that the world was created for the sake of the New Israel the church itself; and where Judaism is centered on God and his Torah, the church is Christocentric since Christ is believed to be God and his Word.

            "In narrative, a motif listen moh-TEEF is a distinctive repeating feature or idea; often, it helps develop other narrative or literary aspects such as theme or mood.A narrative motif can be created through the use of imagery, structural components, language, and other elements throughout literature. The flute in Arthur Millers play Death of a Salesman is a recurrent sound motif that conveys rural and idyllic notions. Another example from modern American literature is the green light found in the novel The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald.\nNarratives may include multiple motifs of varying types. In Shakespeares play Macbeth, he uses a variety of narrative elements to create many different motifs. Imagistic references to blood and water are continually repeated. The phrase fair is foul, and foul is fair is echoed at many points in the play, a combination that mixes the concepts of good and evil. The play also features the central motif of the washing of hands, one that combines both verbal images and the movement of the actors.\nIn a narrative, a motif establishes a pattern of ideas that may serve different conceptual purposes in different works. Kurt Vonnegut, for example, in his non-linear narratives such as Slaughterhouse-Five and Cats Cradle makes frequent use of motif to connect different moments that might seem otherwise separated by time and space. In the American science fiction cult classic Blade Runner, director Ridley Scott uses motifs to not only establish a dark and shadowy film noir atmosphere, but also to weave together the thematic complexities of the plot. Throughout the film, the recurring motif of eyes is connected to a constantly changing flow of images, and sometimes violent manipulations, in order to call into question our ability, and the narrators own, to accurately perceive and understand reality.Narrative motifs can be ironic. For example, in Michael Crichtons Jurassic Park novel, control is a recurring motif via chapter title and topic of discussion; its an ironic motif that is instantiated in the constant creation of the unknown and the belief that it can be controlled and contained. The irony is explained through the articulation of Dr. Ian Malcolms dialogue."

            "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a 2004 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the fifth main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2002s Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and the seventh installment overall. It was released in October 2004 for the PlayStation 2, in June 2005 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox, and in November 2010 for Mac OS X. The game is set within an open world environment that players can explore and interact with at their leisure. The story follows former gangster Carl CJ Johnson, who returns home following his mothers murder and is drawn back into his former gang and a life of crime while clashing with corrupt authorities and powerful criminals. Carls journey takes him across the fictional U.S. state of San Andreas, which is heavily based on California and Nevada and encompasses three major cities: Los Santos inspired by Los Angeles, San Fierro San Francisco and Las Venturas Las Vegas.The game features references to many real-life elements of the world, such as its cities, regions, and landmarks, with its plot heavily based on several real-life events in Los Angeles in the early 1990s, including the rivalry between real-life street gangs, the crack epidemic of the 1980s and early 1990s, the LAPD Rampart scandal, and the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Unlike its predecessor, San Andreas introduced gameplay elements that were incorporated in later games, including RPG-style mechanics, customisation options with both clothing and vehicle appearances, a vast array of activities and mini-games, and the inclusion of gambling games.\nConsidered by many reviewers to be one of the greatest video games ever made, San Andreas received critical acclaim upon release, with praise directed at its music, story and gameplay, and criticism for its graphics and some aspects of its controls. It was the best-selling video game of 2004, and with over 27.5 million copies sold worldwide as of 2011, it is the best-selling PlayStation 2 game and one of the best-selling video games of all time. Like its predecessors, San Andreas is cited as a landmark in video games for its far-reaching influence within the industry. The games violence and sexual content was the source of much public concern and controversy. In particular, a player-made software patch, dubbed the Hot Coffee mod, unlocked a previously hidden sexual scene, resulting in the game being re-rated AO by the North American Entertainment Software Rating Board although its previous M rating was reinstated after the game was edited to remove the content. A remastered version of the game was released for Android and iOS in 2013, for Windows Phone, Fire OS and Xbox 360 in 2014, and for PlayStation 3 in 2015. In June 2018, the game was made available for the Xbox One via backward compatibility. An enhanced version with the subtitle The Definitive Edition was released in 2021, and a virtual reality version for Oculus Quest 2 is in development. The next main entry in the series, Grand Theft Auto IV, was released in April 2008."

It stars JoBeth Williams, Craig T. Nelson and Beatrice Straight, and was produced by Spielberg and Frank Marshall. The film focuses on a suburban family whose home is invaded by malevolent ghosts that abduct their youngest daughter.\nAs Spielberg was contractually unable to direct another film while he made E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Hooper was selected based on his work on The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and The Funhouse. Spielberg conceived Poltergeist as a horror sequel to his 1977 film Close Encounters of the Third Kind titled Night Skies; however, Hooper was less interested in the sci-fi elements and suggested they collaborate on a ghost story. Accounts differ as to the level of Spielbergs involvement, but it is clear that he was frequently on set during filming and exerted significant creative control. For that reason, some have expressed the view that Spielberg should be considered the films co-director or even main director, though both Spielberg and Hooper have disputed this.\nReleased by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on June 4, 1982, Poltergeist was a major critical and commercial success, becoming the eighth-highest-grossing film of 1982. Years since its release, the film has been recognized as a horror classic. It was nominated for three Academy Awards, named by the Chicago Film Critics Association as the 20th-scariest film ever made, and the scene of the clown doll attack was ranked as No. 80 on Bravos 100 Scariest Movie Moments. The film also appeared at No. 84 on American Film Institutes 100 Years..100 Thrills, a list of Americas most heart-pounding movies. It was followed by Poltergeist II: The Other Side 1986, Poltergeist III 1988, and a 2015 remake."

However, Bender is also occasionally portrayed as possessing a sympathetic side, suggesting that he is not as belligerent as he claims, a view often echoed by his friends."

It saw the Neolithic Revolution, a wide-ranging set of developments that appear to have arisen independently in several parts of the world. This Neolithic package included the introduction of farming, domestication of animals, and change from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to one of settlement.\nIt began about 12,000 years ago when farming appeared in the Epipalaeolithic Near East, and later in other parts of the world. The Neolithic lasted in the Near East until the transitional period of the Chalcolithic Copper Age from about 6,500 years ago 4500 BC, marked by the development of metallurgy, leading up to the Bronze Age and Iron Age.\nIn other places the Neolithic followed the Mesolithic Middle Stone Age and then lasted until later. In Ancient Egypt, the Neolithic lasted until the Protodynastic period, c. 3150 BC. In China it lasted until circa 2000 BC with the rise of the pre-Shang Erlitou culture, and in Scandinavia the Neolithic lasted until about 2000 BC.The term Neolithic is modern, based on Greek  nos new and  lthos stone, literally New Stone Age.

            "The superfluous man Russian:  , lshniy chelovk, extra person is an 1840s and 1850s Russian literary concept derived from the Byronic hero. It refers to an individual, perhaps talented and capable, who does not fit into social norms. In most cases, this person is born into wealth and privilege. Typical characteristics are disregard for social values, cynicism, and existential boredom; typical behaviors are gambling, drinking, romantic intrigues and duels. He is often unmindful, indifferent or unempathetic with societys issues and can carelessly distress others with his actions, despite his position of power. He will often use his power for his own comfort and security and will have very little interest in being charitable or using it for the greater good. \nThe superfluous man will often attempt to manipulate, control or enslave other individuals. Because he has no integrity or ambitions, he is often self-serving and sees little point to being a benefactor or helping others. He will often carelessly try to manipulate, degrade or pacify individuals within the society; in order to gain more comfort and security.\nThe character type originates in Alexander Pushkins verse-novel Eugene Onegin 18251832. This term was popularized by Ivan Turgenevs novella The Diary of a Superfluous Man 1850 and was thereafter applied to characters from earlier novels. Mikhail Lermontovs A Hero of Our Time 1840 depicts another superfluous man  Pechorin  as its protagonist. He can be seen as a nihilist and fatalist. Later examples include Alexander Herzens Beltov in Who Is to Blame? 184546, Turgenevs Rudin 1856, and the title character of Ivan Goncharovs Oblomov 1859.Russian critics such as Vissarion Belinsky 1811-1848 viewed the superfluous man as a byproduct of Nicholas Is reign, when the best-educated men would not enter the discredited government service but, lacking other options for self-realization, doomed themselves to live out their life in passivity. The radical critic Nikolay Dobrolyubov 1836-1861 analyzed the superfluous man as by-product of Russian serfdom. Scholar David Patterson describes the superfluous man as not just .. another literary type but .. a paradigm of a person who has lost a point, a place, a presence in life before concluding that the superfluous man is a homeless man.The superfluous man is often in contrast politically with the great man."

The books are structured as a series of dreams in which Mr Tompkins enters alternative worlds where the physical constants have radically different values from those they have in the real world. Gamow aims to use these alterations to explain modern scientific theories.\nMr Tompkins adventures begin when he chooses to spend the afternoon of a bank holiday attending a lecture on the theory of relativity. The lecture proves less comprehensible than he had hoped and he drifts off to sleep and enters a dream world in which the speed of light is a mere 4.5 m/s 10 mph. This becomes apparent to him through the fact that passing cyclists are subject to a noticeable LorentzFitzGerald contraction. Mr Tompkins becomes acquainted with the Professor delivering the lectures and ultimately marries the Professors daughter, Maud. Later chapters in the books deal with atomic structure Mr Tompkins spends time as a conduction electron, returning to consciousness when he is annihilated in an encounter with a positron, and thermodynamics the Professor expounds an analogy between the second law of thermodynamics and the bias towards the casino in gambling before being confounded by a local reversal of the second law through the intervention of Maxwells demon who has introduced himself to Maud in one of her dreams. Mr Tompkins initials are C.G.H. which stand for c the speed of light, G the constant of gravitation and h Plancks constant. Following their marriage Maud refers to him as Cyril.\nLater books in the series tackled biology and advanced cosmology.\nIn 2010 the first volume of a proposed ten-issue comic book series, The Adventures of Mr. Tompkins, was created by Igor Gamow, George Gamows son, and illustrator Scorpio Steele. In the book Tompkins learns about relativity from Albert Einstein, radioactivity from Marie Curie and the structure of the atom from Ernest Rutherford. A second volume, in which Tompkins meets Charles Darwin, Gregor Mendel and James Watson, was published in July 2011.\nMain belt asteroid 12448 Mr. Tompkins is named after Tompkins.The Scientific Background to the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry begins by citing Mr Tompkins Inside Himself.The University of Akron produced a film adaption of this story starring Prof. Alan Neville Gent, which can be viewed here."

Other guest-stars are Hollywood veterans Lyle Talbot, who claimed that he never refused any acting job, and former cowboy star Tom Keene.\nThe films storyline concerns extraterrestrials who seek to stop humanity from creating a doomsday weapon that could destroy the universe. The aliens implement Plan 9, a scheme to resurrect the Earths dead, referred to as ghouls. By causing chaos, the aliens hope the crisis will force humanity to listen to them; otherwise, the aliens will destroy mankind with armies of the undead.

The earliest surviving works of ancient Greek literature, dating back to the early Archaic period, are the two epic poems the Iliad and the Odyssey, set in an idealized archaic past today identified as having some relation to the Mycenaean era. These two epics, along with the Homeric Hymns and the two poems of Hesiod, Theogony and Works and Days, constituted the major foundations of the Greek literary tradition that would continue into the Classical, Hellenistic, and Roman periods.\nThe lyric poets Sappho, Alcaeus, and Pindar were highly influential during the early development of the Greek poetic tradition. Aeschylus is the earliest Greek tragic playwright for whom any plays have survived complete. Sophocles is famous for his tragedies about Oedipus, particularly Oedipus the King and Antigone. Euripides is known for his plays which often pushed the boundaries of the tragic genre. The comedic playwright Aristophanes wrote in the genre of Old Comedy, while the later playwright Menander was an early pioneer of New Comedy. The historians Herodotus of Halicarnassus and Thucydides, who both lived during the fifth century BC, wrote accounts of events that happened shortly before and during their own lifetimes. The philosopher Plato wrote dialogues, usually centered around his teacher Socrates, dealing with various philosophical subjects, whereas his student Aristotle wrote numerous treatises, which later became highly influential.\nImportant later writers included Apollonius of Rhodes, who wrote The Argonautica, an epic poem about the voyage of the Argonauts; Archimedes, who wrote groundbreaking mathematical treatises; and Plutarch, who wrote mainly biographies and essays. The second-century AD writer Lucian of Samosata was a Greek, who wrote primarily works of satire. Ancient Greek literature has had a profound impact on later Greek literature and also western literature at large. In particular, many ancient Roman authors drew inspiration from their Greek predecessors. Ever since the Renaissance, European authors in general, including Dante Alighieri, William Shakespeare, John Milton, and James Joyce, have all drawn heavily on classical themes and motifs."

The Holocene and the preceding Pleistocene together form the Quaternary period. The Holocene has been identified with the current warm period, known as MIS 1. It is considered by some to be an interglacial period within the Pleistocene Epoch, called the Flandrian interglacial.The Holocene corresponds with the rapid proliferation, growth and impacts of the human species worldwide, including all of its written history, technological revolutions, development of major civilizations, and overall significant transition towards urban living in the present. The human impact on modern-era Earth and its ecosystems may be considered of global significance for the future evolution of living species, including approximately synchronous lithospheric evidence, or more recently hydrospheric and atmospheric evidence of the human impact. In July 2018, the International Union of Geological Sciences split the Holocene Epoch into three distinct ages based on the climate, Greenlandian 11,700 years ago to 8,200 years ago, Northgrippian 8,200 years ago to 4,200 years ago and Meghalayan 4,200 years ago to the present, as proposed by International Commission on Stratigraphy.

Fridman is the co-founder of LetterOne, an international investment business, and first publicized the idea in early 2016. The word indigo was initially chosen based on the term indigo children, which has been used to describe people with unusual and innovative abilities.\nFridman describes the Indigo Era as a disruptive era driven by extraordinary levels of human creativity, where abnormally talented individuals and entities are able to realize new levels of human potential and economic achievement. It is a new economic era where the main source of national wealth is no longer resource rent but the socio-economic infrastructure that allows every person to realise his or her intellectual or creative potential. But, according to Fridman  based on his observations of recent economic indicators, political and market volatility, and historical patterns  it is also an era that will generate winners and losers as lagging countries and groups fail to adapt quickly enough.\nIn late 2016 LetterOnes Global Perspectives journal published an Indigo Index, ranking 152 countries on their ability to compete and grow as economies move away from being powered by natural resources to being powered by ideas, creativity, and digital skills. In 2017 it launched the Indigo Prize, to award new concepts of economic measurement beyond mere GDP as countries in the 21st century transition into economies where innovation, creativity, and digital skills are economic drivers. The competition is intended to stimulate debate about factors currently measured, given evolving economies, technology and skill bases, and what should now be taken into consideration in official economic statistics that measure the health, size and growth of a modern economy."

            "The Napoleonic era is a period in the history of France and Europe. It is generally classified as including the fourth and final stage of the French Revolution, the first being the National Assembly, the second being the Legislative Assembly, and the third being the Directory. The Napoleonic era begins roughly with Napoleon Bonapartes coup dtat, overthrowing the Directory 9 November 1799, establishing the French Consulate, and ends during the Hundred Days and his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo 18 June 1815. The Congress of Vienna soon set out to restore Europe to pre-French Revolution days. Napoleon brought political stability to a land torn by revolution and war. He made peace with the Roman Catholic Church and reversed the most radical religious policies of the Convention. In 1804 Napoleon promulgated the Civil Code, a revised body of civil law, which also helped stabilize French society. The Civil Code affirmed the political and legal equality of all adult men and established a merit-based society in which individuals advanced in education and employment because of talent rather than birth or social standing. The Civil Code confirmed many of the moderate revolutionary policies of the National Assembly but retracted measures passed by the more radical Convention. The code restored patriarchal authority in the family, for example, by making women and children subservient to male heads of households.\nWhilst working to stabilise France, Napoleon also sought to extend his authority throughout Europe. Napoleons armies conquered the Iberian and Italian peninsulas, occupied lands, and he forced Austria, Prussia, and Russia to ally with him and respect French hegemony in Europe. The United Kingdom refused to recognise French hegemony and continued the war throughout.\nThe First French Empire began to unravel in 1812, when he decided to invade Russia. Napoleon underestimated the difficulties his army would have to face whilst occupying Russia. Convinced that the Tsar was conspiring with his British enemies, Napoleon led an army of 600,000 soldiers to Moscow. He defeated the Russian army at Borodino before capturing Moscow, but the Tsar withdrew and Moscow was set ablaze, leaving Napoleons vast army without adequate shelter or supplies. Napoleon ordered a retreat, but the bitter Russian winter and repeated Russian attacks whittled down his army, and only a battered remnant of 30,000 soldiers managed to limp back to French territory. The allies then continued a united effort against Napoleon until they had seized Paris forcing his abdication in 1814. His return to power the next year was resisted by all the allies and his army was defeated by a Prussian and Anglo-Allied force at Waterloo.\n\n"

            "Reynard the Fox is a literary cycle of medieval allegorical Dutch, English, French and German fables. The first extant versions of the cycle date from the second half of the 12th century. The genre was popular throughout the Late Middle Ages, as well as in chapbook form throughout the Early Modern period.\nThe stories are largely concerned with the main character Reynard, an anthropomorphic red fox, trickster figure. His adventures usually involve his deceiving other anthropomorphic animals for his own advantage or trying to avoid their retaliatory efforts. His main enemy and victim across the cycle is his uncle, the wolf, Isengrim or Ysengrim.\nWhile the character of Reynard appears in later works, the core stories were written during the Middle Ages by multiple authors and are often seen as parodies of medieval literature such as courtly love stories and chansons de geste, as well as a satire of political and religious institutions. The trickster fox, Reynard, lives in a society of other talking animals lion, bear, wolf, donkey, et cetera, making the stories a beast epic.The original copies were written in Old French, but have since been translated into many different languages. However, the tales of Reynard come from all across Europe and each retelling has details that are specific to that area. The tales, no matter where they take place, are designed to represent the society around them and include the structures of society around them such as a noble court. While the authors take many liberties with the story telling, not all of the satire is meant to be rude or malicious in intent."

Published in 1953, it is the first James Bond book, and it paved the way for a further eleven novels and two short story collections by Fleming, followed by numerous continuation Bond novels by other authors.\nThe story concerns the British secret agent James Bond, gambling at the casino in Royale-les-Eaux to bankrupt Le Chiffre, the treasurer of a French union and a member of the Russian secret service. Bond is supported in his endeavours by Vesper Lynd, a member of his own service, as well as Felix Leiter of the CIA and Ren Mathis of the French Deuxime Bureau. Fleming used his wartime experiences as a member of the Naval Intelligence Division, and the people he met during his work, to provide plot elements; the character of Bond also reflected many of Flemings personal tastes. Fleming wrote the draft in early 1952 at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica while awaiting his marriage. He was initially unsure whether the work was suitable for publication, but was assured by his friend, the novelist William Plomer, that the novel had promise.\nWithin the spy storyline, Casino Royale deals with themes of Britains position in the world, particularly the relationship with the US in light of the defections to the Soviet Union of the British agents Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean. The book was given broadly positive reviews by critics at the time and sold out in less than a month after its UK release on 13 April 1953, although US sales upon release a year later were much slower.\nSince publication Casino Royale has appeared as a comic strip in The Daily Express, and been adapted for the screen three times: a 1954 episode of the CBS television series Climax! with Barry Nelson as an American Bond, a 1967 film version with David Niven playing Sir James Bond, and a 2006 film in the Eon Productions film series starring Daniel Craig as James Bond."

An expanded edition, titled Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance, was released the following year for Xbox and Windows in addition to the PlayStation 2. A remastered version of the game was later included in the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, and Xbox 360.\nThe story revolves around the Big Shell, a massive offshore clean-up facility seized by a group of terrorists who call themselves the Sons of Liberty. They demand an enormous ransom in exchange for the life of the President of the United States and threaten to destroy the facility and create a cataclysmic environmental disaster if their demands are not met. The motives and identities of many of the antagonists and allies change throughout the course of the game, as the protagonists discover a world-shaking conspiracy constructed by a powerful organization known as the Patriots.\nMetal Gear Solid 2 received acclaim for its gameplay, graphics, and attention to detail. However, critics were initially divided on the protagonist and the philosophical nature and execution of the games storyline, which explores themes such as the Information Age, memetics, social engineering, political conspiracies, censorship, artificial intelligence, existentialism, postmodernism, virtual reality, and the internal struggle of freedom of thought. The game was a commercial success, selling seven million copies by 2004. It has since been considered to be one of the greatest video games of all time, as well as a leading example of artistic expression in video games. The game is often considered ahead of its time for dealing with themes and concepts, such as post-truth politics, fake news, alternative facts, synthetic media, and echo chambers, that became culturally relevant in the 2010s."

            "Human history, also called world history, is the narrative of humanitys past. It is understood and studied through anthropology, archaeology, genetics, and linguistics. Since the invention of writing, human history has been studied through primary and secondary source documents.\nHumanitys written history was preceded by its prehistory, beginning with the Paleolithic Old Stone Age era. This was followed by the Neolithic New Stone Age era, which saw the Agricultural Revolution begin in the Middle East around 10,000 BCE. During this period, humans began the systematic husbandry of plants and animals. As agriculture advanced, most humans transitioned from a nomadic to a settled lifestyle as farmers in permanent settlements. The relative security and increased productivity provided by farming allowed communities to expand into increasingly larger units, fostered by advances in transportation.\nThe earliest complex societies appeared in fertile river valleys. As farming developed, grain agriculture became more sophisticated and prompted a division of labour to store food between growing seasons. Labor divisions led to the rise of a leisured upper class and the development of cities, which provided the foundation for civilization. The growing complexity of human societies necessitated systems of accounting and writing. Hinduism developed in the late Bronze Age on the Indian subcontinent, while the Axial Age witnessed the introduction of religions such as Buddhism, Jainism, Taoism, and Zoroastrianism.\nWith civilizations flourishing, ancient history saw the rise and fall of empires. Post-classical history the Middle Ages from about 500 to 1500 CE witnessed the rise of Christianity, the Islamic Golden Age, and the Renaissance from around 1300 CE. The 15th century introduction of movable type printing in Europe revolutionized communication and facilitated widespread dissemination of information, hastening the end of the Middle Ages and ushering in the Scientific Revolution. The early modern period lasted from about 1500 to 1800 CE. Events during this period included the Age of Discovery and the Age of Enlightenment. By the 18th century, the accumulation of knowledge and technology had reached a critical mass that brought about the Industrial Revolution and began the late modern period, which started around 1800 CE and continues.\nThe above scheme of historical periodization dividing history into antiquity, post-classical, early modern, and late modern periods was developed for, and applies best to, the history of the Old World, particularly Europe and the Mediterranean. Outside this region, including Chinese and Indian civilizations, historical timelines unfolded differently up to the 18th century. By that century, due to extensive international trade and colonization, the histories of most civilizations had become substantially intertwined. Over the last quarter-millennium, the rates of growth of population, agriculture, industry, commerce, scientific knowledge, technology, communications, destructive weapons, and environmental degradation have greatly accelerated."

Key was inspired by the large U.S. flag, with 15 stars and 15 stripes, known as the Star-Spangled Banner, flying triumphantly above the fort during the U.S. victory.\nThe poem was set to the tune of a popular British song written by John Stafford Smith for the Anacreontic Society, a mens social club in London. To Anacreon in Heaven or The Anacreontic Song, with various lyrics, was already popular in the United States. This setting, renamed The Star-Spangled Banner, soon became a well-known U.S. patriotic song. With a range of 19 semitones, it is known for being very difficult to sing. Although the poem has four stanzas, only the first is commonly sung today.\nThe Star-Spangled Banner was first recognized for official use by the U.S. Navy in 1889. In 1931, the U.S. Congress passed a joint resolution 46 Stat. 1508 making the song the official national anthem of the United States, which President Herbert Hoover signed into law. The resolution is now codified at 36 U.S.C.  301a."

The 82-year-old bridge allows passenger and freight trains to cross over South Gregson Street in downtown Durham.\nThe bridge was designed in the 1920s and built in 1940, with a clearance for vehicles of 11 feet 8 inches 3.56 m, the standard height at the time it opened. Since 1973, the standard clearance for bridges was increased to a minimum height of 14 feet 4.27 m, which is 2 feet 4 inches 0.71 m higher than the bridge as built. Despite numerous warning signs about the low clearance, a large number of trucks, buses, and RVs have collided with the overpass at high speed, tearing off roof fixtures, and at times shearing off the trucks roofs, earning the bridge the nicknames the Can Opener and the Gregson Street Guillotine.The bridge gained fame as a nearby office worker, Jrgen Henn, set up cameras in 2008 to track the collisions with the bridge. Henn has recorded over 150 collisions with the bridge, including those after the bridge raising, and the YouTube channel he set up to showcase his recordings has 252,000 subscribers and more than 79 million views.\nDespite the number of crashes, a March 2014 report stated that only three injuries had been recorded, making rebuilding of the bridge a low-priority concern. Later, in October 2019, the North Carolina Railroad Company, which owns the bridge and tracks, raised the bridge by 8 inches 20 cm to 12 feet 4 inches 3.76 m to reduce collisions although that is still well below the standard height of 14ft."

In biblical times, people would often keep at least one piece of livestock that was fed a special diet to fatten it up, thus making it more flavorsome when prepared as a meal. Slaughtering this livestock was to be done on rare and special occasions. Thus when the prodigal son returns, the father kills the fatted calf to show that the celebration is out of the ordinary.\nIn modern usage, killing the fatted calf can simply mean to celebrate in an exuberant manner."

The characters later appeared in the series Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain, and have since returned to their roots as an Animaniacs skit in the 2020 revival of that series.\nPinky and the Brain are genetically enhanced laboratory mice who reside in a cage in the Acme Labs research facility. Brain is highly intelligent, self-centered and scheming, while Pinky is good-natured but feeble-minded. In each episode, Brain devises a new plan to take over the world which ultimately ends in failure, usually due to the impossibility of Brains plan, Brains own overconfidence, Pinkys bumbling, an oversight on Brains part, circumstances beyond their control, or multiples thereof. In common with many other Animaniacs shorts, many episodes are in some way a parody of something else, usually a film or novel."

This usage of the phrase can be traced back to the 17th century and has been associated with various trades where quantities were measured by comparison to the width or length of a thumb.\nA modern folk etymology holds that the phrase is derived from the maximum width of a stick allowed for wife-beating under English common law, but no such law ever existed. This belief may have originated in a rumored statement by 18th-century judge Sir Francis Buller that a man may beat his wife with a stick no wider than his thumb. The rumor produced numerous jokes and satirical cartoons at Bullers expense, but there is no record that he made such a statement.\nEnglish jurist Sir William Blackstone wrote in his Commentaries on the Laws of England of an old law that once allowed moderate beatings by husbands, but he did not mention thumbs or any specific implements. Wife-beating has been officially outlawed for centuries in England and the rest of the United Kingdom and the United States, but continued in practice; several 19th-century American court rulings referred to an ancient doctrine that the judges believed had allowed husbands to physically punish their wives using implements no thicker than their thumbs.\nThe phrase rule of thumb first became associated with domestic abuse in the 1970s, after which the spurious legal definition was cited as factual in a number of law journals, and the United States Commission on Civil Rights published a report on domestic abuse titled Under the Rule of Thumb in 1982. Some efforts were made to discourage the phrase, which was seen as taboo owing to this false origin. During the 1990s, several authors correctly identified the spurious etymology; however, the connection to domestic violence was cited in some legal sources even into the early 2000s."

            "The term modern period or modern era sometimes also called modern history or modern times is the period of history that succeeds the Middle Ages which ended approximately 1500 AD. This terminology is a historical periodization that is applied primarily to European and Western history.\nThe modern era can be further divided as follows:\n\nThe early modern period lasted from c. AD 1500 to 1800 and resulted in wide-ranging intellectual, political and economic change. It brought with it the Age of Enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution and an Age of Revolutions, beginning with those in America and France and later spreading in other countries, partly as a result of upheavals of the Napoleonic Wars.\nThe late modern period began around 1800 with the end of the political revolutions in the late 18th century and involved the transition from a world dominated by imperial and colonial powers into one of nations and nationhood following the two great world wars, World War I and World War II, and the Cold War. The period following the end of World War II in 1945 and continuing to the present is called contemporary history, which is alternatively considered either a subperiod of the late modern period or a separate period beginning after the late modern period.The modern period has been a period of significant development in the fields of science, politics, warfare, and technology. It has also been an age of discovery and globalization. During this time, the European powers and later their colonies, began a political, economic, and cultural colonization of the rest of the world. \nBy the late 19th and early 20th century, modernist art, politics, science and culture has come to dominate not only Western Europe and North America, but almost every civilized area on the globe, including movements thought of as opposed to the western world and globalization. The modern era is closely associated with the development of individualism, capitalism, urbanization and a belief in the positive possibilities of technological and political progress.\nThe brutal wars and other problems of this era, many of which come from the effects of rapid change, and the connected loss of strength of traditional religious and ethical norms, have led to many reactions against modern development. Optimism and the belief in constant progress have been most recently criticized by postmodernism, while the dominance of Western Europe and North America over other continents has been criticized by postcolonial theory."

The film stars Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, a man who grew up living an ordinary life thatunbeknownst to himtakes place on a large set populated by actors for a television show about him. The supporting cast includes Laura Linney, Ed Harris, Noah Emmerich, Natascha McElhone, Holland Taylor, Paul Giamatti, and Brian Delate.\nUnlike the finished product, Niccols spec script was more of a science-fiction thriller, with the story set in New York City. Scott Rudin purchased the script and set up production at Paramount Pictures. Brian De Palma was to direct before Weir signed as director, making the film for $60 million$20 million less than the original estimate. Niccol rewrote the script while the crew was waiting for Carrey to sign. The majority of filming took place at Seaside, Florida, a master-planned community located in the Florida Panhandle.\nThe Truman Show held its world premiere in Los Angeles on June 1, 1998, and was released in North America on June 5. The film was a financial success, debuting to critical acclaim, and earned numerous nominations at the 71st Academy Awards, 56th Golden Globe Awards, 52nd British Academy Film Awards, and 25th Saturn Awards. The Truman Show has been analyzed as an exploration of simulated reality, existentialism, surveillance, religion, metaphilosophy, privacy, and reality television, and described as a genre-blending that features elements of dystopian fiction, metafiction, psychological drama, romantic comedy, satire, and social science fiction.\n\n"

            "The Latin cogito, ergo sum, usually translated into English as I think, therefore I am, is the first principle of Ren Descartess philosophy. He originally published it in French as je pense, donc je suis in his 1637 Discourse on the Method, so as to reach a wider audience than Latin would have allowed. It later appeared in Latin in his Principles of Philosophy, and a similar phrase also featured prominently in his Meditations on First Philosophy. The dictum is also sometimes referred to as the cogito. As Descartes explained in a margin note, we cannot doubt of our existence while we doubt. In the posthumously published The Search for Truth by Natural Light, he expressed this insight as dubito, ergo sum, vel, quod idem est, cogito, ergo sum I doubt, therefore I am  or what is the same  I think, therefore I am. Antoine Lonard Thomas, in a 1765 essay in honor of Descartes presented it as dubito, ergo cogito, ergo sum I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I am.Descartess statement became a fundamental element of Western philosophy, as it purported to provide a certain foundation for knowledge in the face of radical doubt. While other knowledge could be a figment of imagination, deception, or mistake, Descartes asserted that the very act of doubting ones own existence servedat minimumas proof of the reality of ones own mind; there must be a thinking entityin this case the selffor there to be a thought.\nOne critique of the dictum, first suggested by Pierre Gassendi, is that it presupposes that there is an I which must be doing the thinking. According to this line of criticism, the most that Descartes was entitled to say was that thinking is occurring, not that I am thinking."

The Wiggles were founded in 1991 by Field, Murray Cook, Jeff Fatt, Greg Page and Phillip Wilcher. Wilcher left the group after their first album. Page retired in 2006 due to ill health and was replaced by understudy Sam Moran, but returned in 2012, replacing Moran. At the end of 2012, Cook, Fatt and Page retired and were replaced by Gillespie, Pryce and Emma Watkins. Cook and Fatt retained their shareholding in the group and all three continued to have input into its creative and production aspects. Watkins departed the group in 2021, with Hawkins taking her place.\nField and Fatt were members of the Australian pop band the Cockroaches in the 1980s, and Cook was a member of several bands before meeting Field and Page at Macquarie University, where they were studying to become pre-school teachers. In 1991, Field was inspired to create an album of childrens music based upon concepts of early childhood education, and he enlisted Cook, Page, and Fatt to assist him. They began touring to promote the album and became so successful, they quit their teaching jobs to perform full-time. The group augmented their act with costumed characters Dorothy the Dinosaur, Henry the Octopus and Wags the Dog, as well as the human character Captain Feathersword, played by Paul Paddick since 1993. Shirley Shawn the Unicorn was later introduced. They originally travelled with a small group of dancers, which later grew into a larger troupe. The groups albums, DVDs and television programs have been produced independently since their inception. The height of their popularity came in the early 2000s, after they broke into the American market.\nThe group were formally consolidated in 2005. They were listed at the top of Business Review Weeklys top-earning Australian entertainers four years in a row and earned A$45 million in 2009. In 2011, the worldwide recession hit the Wiggles, as it had done for many Australian entertainers; they earned $28 million, but they still appeared second on BRWs list that year. The Wiggles have enjoyed almost universal approval throughout their history, and their music has been played in pre-schools all over the world. They have earned multiple Gold, Platinum and double Platinum records; have sold 23 million DVDs and 7 million CDs; and have performed, on average, to one million people per year.

European prehistoric art started as mobile Upper Paleolithic rock and cave painting and petroglyph art and was characteristic of the period between the Paleolithic and the Iron Age. Written histories of European art often begin with the art of Ancient Israel and the Ancient Aegean civilizations, dating from the 3rd millennium BC. Parallel with these significant cultures, art of one form or another existed all over Europe, wherever there were people, leaving signs such as carvings, decorated artifacts and huge standing stones. However a consistent pattern of artistic development within Europe becomes clear only with the art of Ancient Greece, adopted and transformed by Rome and carried; with the Roman Empire, across much of Europe, North Africa and Western Asia.The influence of the art of the Classical period waxed and waned throughout the next two thousand years, seeming to slip into a distant memory in parts of the Medieval period, to re-emerge in the Renaissance, suffer a period of what some early art historians viewed as decay during the Baroque period, to reappear in a refined form in Neo-Classicism and to be reborn in Post-Modernism.Before the 1800s, the Christian church was a major influence upon European art, the commissions of the Church, architectural, painterly and sculptural, providing the major source of work for artists. The history of the Church was very much reflected in the history of art, during this period. In the same period of time there was renewed interest in heroes and heroines, tales of mythological gods and goddesses, great wars, and bizarre creatures which were not connected to religion. Most art of the last 200 years has been produced without reference to religion and often with no particular ideology at all, but art has often been influenced by political issues, whether reflecting the concerns of patrons or the artist.\nEuropean art is arranged into a number of stylistic periods, which, historically, overlap each other as different styles flourished in different areas. Broadly the periods are, Classical, Byzantine, Medieval, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo, Neoclassical, Modern, Postmodern and New European Painting."

Characters make reference to King Hamlets death without the plots first establishment of said fact. Since the play is about Hamlet and the revenge more so than the motivation, Shakespeare uses in medias res to bypass superfluous exposition.\nWorks that employ in medias res often later use flashback and nonlinear narrative for exposition to fill in the backstory. In Homers Odyssey, the reader first learns about Odysseuss journey when he is held captive on Calypsos island. The reader then finds out, in Books IX through XII, that the greater part of Odysseuss journey precedes that moment in the narrative. In Homers Iliad there are fewer flashbacks, although it opens in the thick of the Trojan War."

This may have occurred decades or even centuries after Columbus for certain cultures.\nMany pre-Columbian civilizations were marked by permanent settlements, cities, agriculture, civic and monumental architecture, major earthworks, and complex societal hierarchies. Some of these civilizations had long faded by the time of the first permanent European colonies c. late 16thearly 17th centuries, and are known only through archaeological investigations and oral history. Other civilizations were contemporary with the colonial period and were described in European historical accounts of the time. A few, such as the Maya civilization, had their own written records. Because many Christian Europeans of the time viewed such texts as pagan, men like Diego de Landa burned them, even while seeking to preserve native histories. Only a few hidden documents have survived in their original languages, while others were transcribed or dictated into Spanish, giving modern historians glimpses of ancient culture and knowledge. \nMany Indigenous peoples in the Americas continue traditional practices while evolving and adapting to the modern world.\nThe alternative terms precontact, precolonial, or prehistoric Americas are also used; in Hispanic America, the usual term is pre-Hispanic; in Brazil, the term used is pre-Cabraline."

            "A narrative, story, or tale is any account of a series of related events or experiences, whether nonfictional memoir, biography, news report, documentary, travelogue, etc. or fictional fairy tale, fable, legend, thriller, novel, etc. Narratives can be presented through a sequence of written or spoken words, through still or moving images, or through any combination of these. The word derives from the Latin verb narrare to tell, which is derived from the adjective gnarus knowing or skilled. Narration i.e., the process of presenting a narrative is a rhetorical mode of discourse, broadly defined and paralleling argumentation, description, and exposition, is one of four rhetorical modes of discourse. More narrowly defined, it is the fiction-writing mode in which a narrator communicates directly to an audience. The school of literary criticism known as Russian formalism has applied methods that are more often used to analyse narrative fiction, to non-fictional texts such as political speeches.Oral storytelling is the earliest method for sharing narratives. During most peoples childhoods, narratives are used to guide them on proper behavior, cultural history, formation of a communal identity, and values, as especially studied in anthropology today among traditional indigenous peoples.Narrative is found in all forms of human creativity, art, and entertainment, including speech, literature, theatre, music and song, comics, journalism, film, television and video, video games, radio, game-play, unstructured recreation, and performance in general, as well as some painting, sculpture, drawing, photography, and other visual arts, as long as a sequence of events is presented. Several art movements, such as modern art, refuse the narrative in favor of the abstract and conceptual.\nNarrative can be organized into a number of thematic or formal categories: nonfiction such as creative nonfiction, biography, journalism, transcript poetry, and historiography; fictionalization of historical events such as anecdote, myth, legend, and historical fiction and fiction proper such as literature in the form of prose and sometimes poetry, short stories, novels, narrative poems and songs, and imaginary narratives as portrayed in other textual forms, games, or live or recorded performances. Narratives may also be nested within other narratives, such as narratives told by an unreliable narrator a character typically found in the genre of noir fiction. An important part of many narratives is its narrative mode, the set of methods used to communicate the narrative through a written or spoken commentary see also Aesthetics approach below."

Keeravani composed the songs and the background score while K. K. Senthil Kumar was the director of photography.

Nani reincarnates as a housefly and tries to avenge his death and protect Bindu from an obsessive Sudeep.\nThe idea for the film originated in the mid-1990s from a conversation in which Rajamoulis father and screenwriter V. Vijayendra Prasad joked with Rajamouli about the idea of a fly seeking revenge against a human. Rajamouli reconsidered the idea after finishing Maryada Ramanna 2010, and developed it into a script. The films production began on 7 December 2010 at Ramanaidu Studios in Hyderabad. Principal photography began on 22 February 2011 and continued until late February 2012. Makuta VFX and Annapurna Studios oversaw Eegas visual effects and digital intermediate process, respectively.\nThe two versions of the film, alongside a Malayalam-dubbed version titled Eecha, were released on 6 July 2012 in approximately 1,100 screens globally. The performances of the cast, Rajamoulis direction, and visual effects received critical acclaim upon release. Eega was one of the highest-grossing Telugu films of the year, earning more than 125 crore $23 million.

Coats of arms of noble families, often after their extinction, becomes attached to the territories they used to own, giving rise to municipal coats of arms by the 16th century.\nWestern heraldry spread beyond its core territory of Latin Christendom in the 17th century, Western heraldic traditions being adopted in the Russian Empire. With colonialism, the use of heraldry has spread to other continents, e.g. Africa and the Americas.\nWhile some concepts associated with heraldry, such as nobility and monarchy, have declined in favour of Republicanism in the 19th to 20th centuries, heraldry as a whole continues to flourish, with the art form today enjoying greater prevalence than ever in countries with strong heraldic traditions.

It is set during the Battle of Berlin in World War II, when Nazi Germany is on the verge of defeat, and depicts the final days of Adolf Hitler portrayed by Bruno Ganz. The cast includes Alexandra Maria Lara, Corinna Harfouch, Ulrich Matthes, Juliane Khler, Heino Ferch, Christian Berkel, Alexander Held, Matthias Habich, and Thomas Kretschmann. The film is a German-Austrian-Italian co-production.\nPrincipal photography took place from September to November 2003, on location in Berlin, Munich, and in Saint Petersburg, Russia. As the film is set in and around the Fhrerbunker, Hirschbiegel used eyewitness accounts, survivors memoirs, and other historical sources during production to reconstruct the look and atmosphere of 1940s Berlin. The screenplay was based on the books Inside Hitlers Bunker by historian Joachim Fest and Until the Final Hour by Traudl Junge, one of Hitlers secretaries, among other accounts of the period.\nThe film premiered at the Toronto Film Festival on 14 September 2004. It was controversial with audiences for showing a human side of Hitler, and for its portrayal of members of the Third Reich. It later received a wide theatrical release in Germany under its production company Constantin Film. The film grossed over $92 million. Critics gave favourable reviews, particularly for Ganzs performance as Adolf Hitler and Eichingers screenplay. It was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 77th Academy Awards.\n\n"

It occurred after the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages and was associated with great social change. In addition to the standard periodization, proponents of a long Renaissance may put its beginning in the 14th century and its end in the 17th century.The traditional view focuses more on the early modern aspects of the Renaissance and argues that it was a break from the past, but many historians today focus more on its medieval aspects and argue that it was an extension of the Middle Ages. However, the beginnings of the period  the early Renaissance of the 15th century and the Italian Proto-Renaissance from around 1250 or 1300  overlap considerably with the Late Middle Ages, conventionally dated to c.12501500, and the Middle Ages themselves were a long period filled with gradual changes, like the modern age; and as a transitional period between both, the Renaissance has close similarities to both, especially the late and early sub-periods of either.The intellectual basis of the Renaissance was its version of humanism, derived from the concept of Roman humanitas and the rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy, such as that of Protagoras, who said that man is the measure of all things. This new thinking became manifest in art, architecture, politics, science and literature. Early examples were the development of perspective in oil painting and the revived knowledge of how to make concrete. Although the invention of metal movable type sped the dissemination of ideas from the later 15th century, the changes of the Renaissance were not uniform across Europe: the first traces appear in Italy as early as the late 13th century, in particular with the writings of Dante and the paintings of Giotto.\nAs a cultural movement, the Renaissance encompassed innovative flowering of Latin and vernacular literatures, beginning with the 14th-century resurgence of learning based on classical sources, which contemporaries credited to Petrarch; the development of linear perspective and other techniques of rendering a more natural reality in painting; and gradual but widespread educational reform. In politics, the Renaissance contributed to the development of the customs and conventions of diplomacy, and in science to an increased reliance on observation and inductive reasoning. Although the Renaissance saw revolutions in many intellectual and social scientific pursuits, as well as the introduction of modern banking and the field of accounting, it is perhaps best known for its artistic developments and the contributions of such polymaths as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, who inspired the term Renaissance man.The Renaissance began in the Republic of Florence, one of the many states of Italy. Various theories have been proposed to account for its origins and characteristics, focusing on a variety of factors including the social and civic peculiarities of Florence at the time: its political structure, the patronage of its dominant family, the Medici, and the migration of Greek scholars and their texts to Italy following the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks. Other major centers were northern Italian city-states such as Venice, Genoa, Milan, Bologna, Rome during the Renaissance Papacy and Naples. From Italy, the Renaissance spread throughout Europe in Flanders, France, Britain, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Poland, Hungary with Beatrice of Naples and elsewhere.\nThe Renaissance has a long and complex historiography, and, in line with general scepticism of discrete periodizations, there has been much debate among historians reacting to the 19th-century glorification of the Renaissance and individual cultural heroes as Renaissance men, questioning the usefulness of Renaissance as a term and as a historical delineation. Some observers have called into question whether the Renaissance was a cultural advance from the Middle Ages, instead seeing it as a period of pessimism and nostalgia for classical antiquity, while social and economic historians, especially of the longue dure, have instead focused on the continuity between the two eras, which are linked, as Panofsky observed, by a thousand ties.The term rinascita rebirth first appeared in Giorgio Vasaris Lives of the Artists c. 1550, anglicized as the Renaissance in the 1830s. The word has also been extended to other historical and cultural movements, such as the Carolingian Renaissance 8th and 9th centuries, Ottonian Renaissance 10th and 11th century, and the Renaissance of the 12th century."

            "The African humid period AHP also known by other names is a climate period in Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today. The covering of much of the Sahara desert by grasses, trees and lakes was caused by changes in Earths orbit around the Sun; changes in vegetation and dust in the Sahara which strengthened the African monsoon; and increased greenhouse gases.\nDuring the preceding Last Glacial Maximum, the Sahara contained extensive dune fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, but its lakes and rivers such as Lake Victoria and the White Nile were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,60014,500 years ago at the end of Heinrich event 1, simultaneously to the BllingAllerd warming. Rivers and lakes such as Lake Chad formed or expanded, glaciers grew on Mount Kilimanjaro and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the Younger Dryas and the short 8.2 kiloyear event. The African humid period ended 6,0005,000 years ago during the Piora Oscillation cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the Sahel, Arabia and East Africa, the period appears to have taken place in several steps such as the 4.2-kiloyear event.\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Deserts, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. People in the Sahara lived as hunter-gatherers and domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. They left archaeological sites and artifacts such as one of the oldest ships in the world, and rock paintings such as those in the Cave of Swimmers and in the Acacus Mountains. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the Nile Valley and Mesopotamia, where they gave rise to early complex societies."

The piece was first displayed online on 6 October 2006, and was later broadcast as a television and cinema spot in the Netherlands and the Middle East. The ad was created from the budget left over from the earlier Daughters campaign, and was intended to be the first in a series of such online-focused campaigns by the company. Later such videos include Onslaught and Amy. Evolution was directed by Canadian director Yael Staav and Tim Piper, with sound design handled by the Vapor Music Group, and post-production by SoHo.\nThe advert was a critical, popular, and financial success. It won a number of awards in the advertising industry, including two Cannes Lions Grand Prix awards and an Epica DOr. It has been discussed in many mainstream television programmes and print publications, and the exposure generated by the spot has been estimated to be worth over $150M. Evolution has also spawned numerous unofficial alternate versions, including a title sequence to a BBC sketch show and the short parody Slob Evolution, which has gone on to itself be nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award."

In later releases, additional elves were added to the application and viewers could upload different images for each elf. Still later, social media applications were added, included those allowing viewers to save and/or download the films they had created through visiting the website. In 2008, OfficeMax partnered with JibJab and added a registration requirement in order to use the site. Traffic dropped to 56 million. JibJab worked to enhance the performance and distribution of the videos.In 2009, the campaign being run by JibJab, the registration requirement was dropped, and social elements were added.

Players may access the level after collecting a special combination of items to conjure a portal leading to the level.

The attention surrounding the hoax influenced developers to acknowledge it as an inside joke by seeding easter egg references in related games during the late 1990s: the Diablo expansion pack Diablo: Hellfire, and 1998s StarCraft. The levels appearance in Diablo II marked the first instance of the hoax being developed into actual in-game content. Fan appeal for the cow level affected later Blizzard titles, which led to similarly themed levels appearing in Diablo III and World of Warcraft, as well as several imitations and recreations in other video games."

The film centers on four young friends who are stalked by a hook-wielding killer one year after covering up a car accident in which they supposedly killed a man. The film also draws inspiration from the urban legend known as The Hook and the 1980s slasher films Prom Night 1980 and The House on Sorority Row 1982.\nPrior to Scream Williamson was approached to adapt Duncans source novel by producer Erik Feig. Where Williamsons screenplay for Scream contained prominent elements of satire and self-referentiality, his adaptation of I Know What You Did Last Summer reworked the novels central plot to resemble a straightforward 1980s-era slasher film. After the success of Scream, the film was rushed into production.\nI Know What You Did Last Summer was released theatrically on October 17, 1997. It received mixed reviews from critics, but was commercially successful, grossing $125 million worldwide on a budget of $17 million, and remaining number 1 at the U.S. box office for three consecutive weeks. It was also nominated for and won multiple awards.The film was followed by two sequels, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer 1998 and Ill Always Know What You Did Last Summer 2006. I Know What You Did Last Summer has also been parodied and referenced in popular culture, and credited alongside Scream with revitalizing the slasher genre in the 1990s."

            "Western civilization traces its roots back to Europe and the Mediterranean. It is linked to ancient Greece, the Roman Empire and with Medieval Western Christendom which emerged from the Middle Ages to experience such transformative episodes as Scholasticism, the Renaissance, the Reformation, the Enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution, the Scientific Revolution, and the development of liberal democracy. The civilizations of Classical Greece and Ancient Rome are considered seminal periods in Western history. Major cultural contributions also came from the Christianized Germanic peoples, such as the Franks, Goths, and Burgundians. Charlemagne founded the Carolingian Empire and is referred to as the Father of Europe. Contributions also emerged from pagan peoples of pre-Christian Europe, such as the Celts and Germanic pagans as well as some significant religious contributions derived from Judaism and Hellenistic Judaism stemming back to Second Temple Judea, Galilee, and the early Jewish diaspora; and some other Middle Eastern influences. Western Christianity has played a prominent role in the shaping of Western civilization, which throughout most of its history, has been nearly equivalent to Christian culture. There were Christians outside of the West, such as China, India, Russia, Byzantium and the Middle East. Western civilization has spread to produce the dominant cultures of modern Americas and Oceania, and has had immense global influence in recent centuries in many ways.\nFollowing the 5th century Fall of Rome, Europe entered the Middle Ages, during which period the Catholic Church filled the power vacuum left in the West by the fall of the Western Roman Empire, while the Eastern Roman Empire or Byzantine Empire endured in the East for centuries, becoming a Hellenic Eastern contrast to the Latin West. By the 12th century, Western Europe was experiencing a flowering of art and learning, propelled by the construction of cathedrals, the establishment of medieval universities, and greater contact with the medieval Islamic world via Al-Andalus and Sicily, from where Arabic texts on science and philosophy were translated into Latin. Christian unity was shattered by the Reformation from the 16th century. A merchant class grew out of city states, initially in the Italian peninsula see Italian city-states, and Europe experienced the Renaissance from the 14th to the 17th century, heralding an age of technological and artistic advance and ushering in the Age of Discovery which saw the rise of such global European Empires as those of Portugal and Spain.\nThe Industrial Revolution began in Britain in the 18th century. Under the influence of the Enlightenment, the Age of Revolution emerged from the United States and France as part of the transformation of the West into its industrialised, democratised modern form. The lands of North and South America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand became first part of European Empires and then home to new Western nations, while Africa and Asia were largely carved up between Western powers. Laboratories of Western democracy were founded in Britains colonies in Australasia from the mid-19th centuries, while South America largely created new autocracies. In the 20th century, absolute monarchy disappeared from Europe, and despite episodes of Fascism and Communism, by the close of the century, virtually all of Europe was electing its leaders democratically. Most Western nations were heavily involved in the First and Second World Wars and protracted Cold War. World War II saw Fascism defeated in Europe, and the emergence of the United States and Soviet Union as rival global powers and a new East-West political contrast.\nOther than in Russia, the European Empires disintegrated after World War II and civil rights movements and widescale multi-ethnic, multi-faith migrations to Europe, the Americas and Oceania lowered the earlier predominance of ethnic Europeans in Western culture. European nations moved towards greater economic and political co-operation through the European Union. The Cold War ended around 1990 with the collapse of Soviet-imposed Communism in Central and Eastern Europe. In the 21st century, the Western World retains significant global economic power and influence. The West has contributed a great many technological, political, philosophical, artistic and religious aspects to modern international culture: having been a crucible of Catholicism, Protestantism, democracy, industrialisation; the first major civilisation to seek to abolish slavery during the 19th century, the first to enfranchise women beginning in Australasia at the end of the 19th century and the first to put to use such technologies as steam, electric and nuclear power. The West invented cinema, television, the personal computer and the Internet; produced artists such as Michelangelo, Shakespeare, Leonardo da Vinci, Beethoven, Vincent van Gogh, Picasso, Bach, and Mozart; developed sports such as soccer, cricket, golf, tennis, rugby and basketball; and transported humans to an astronomical object for the first time with the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon Landing."

            "Confirmation bias",
            "Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms or supports ones prior beliefs or values. People display this bias when they select information that supports their views, ignoring contrary information, or when they interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing attitudes. The effect is strongest for desired outcomes, for emotionally charged issues, and for deeply entrenched beliefs. Confirmation bias cannot be eliminated, but it can be managed, for example, by education and training in critical thinking skills.\nBiased search for information, biased interpretation of this information, and biased memory recall, have been invoked to explain four specific effects:\n\nattitude polarization when a disagreement becomes more extreme even though the different parties are exposed to the same evidence\nbelief perseverance when beliefs persist after the evidence for them is shown to be false\nthe irrational primacy effect a greater reliance on information encountered early in a series\nillusory correlation when people falsely perceive an association between two events or situations.A series of psychological experiments in the 1960s suggested that people are biased toward confirming their existing beliefs. Later work re-interpreted these results as a tendency to test ideas in a one-sided way, focusing on one possibility and ignoring alternatives. Explanations for the observed biases include wishful thinking and the limited human capacity to process information. Another proposal is that people show confirmation bias because they are pragmatically assessing the costs of being wrong, rather than investigating in a neutral, scientific way.\nFlawed decisions due to confirmation bias have been found in a wide range of political, organizational, financial and scientific contexts. These biases contribute to overconfidence in personal beliefs and can maintain or strengthen beliefs in the face of contrary evidence. For example, confirmation bias produces systematic errors in scientific research based on inductive reasoning the gradual accumulation of supportive evidence. Similarly, a police detective may identify a suspect early in an investigation, but then may only seek confirming rather than disconfirming evidence. A medical practitioner may prematurely focus on a particular disorder early in a diagnostic session, and then seek only confirming evidence.

However, resistance to Americanization of the university community restrained it, although it was still much more successful than Sovietization.:6 Americanization has become more prevalent since the end of the Soviet Union in 1991 and especially since the advent of widespread high speed Internet use in the mid 2000s.\nCriticism of Americanization has included opposition to US investments in Europe during the 1960s, which subsided by the 1970s.

Similarly, if 100 patients die during the study so that 100 patients survive, ten pre-specified predictors can be fitted reliably. If more are fitted, the rule implies that overfitting is likely and the results will not predict well outside the training data.

It is also the royal anthemplayed specifically in the presence of the monarchof the aforementioned countries, in addition to Australia since 1984, Canada since 1980, Belize since 1981, Antigua and Barbuda since 1981, The Bahamas since 1973, and most other Commonwealth realms.\nIn countries not part of the British Empire, the tune of God Save the King has provided the basis for various patriotic songs, though still generally connected with royal ceremony. The melody continues to be used for the national anthem of Liechtenstein, Oben am jungen Rhein, and the royal anthem of Norway, Kongesangen. The melody is used for the American patriotic song My Country, Tis of Thee also known as America. The melody was also used for the national anthem Heil dir im Siegerkranz of the German Empire from 1871 to 1918 and as The Prayer of Russians, the imperial anthem of Russia from 1816 to 1833. In Switzerland, it is known as Rufst du, mein Vaterland.\nBeyond its first verse, which is consistent, God Save the King has many historic and extant versions. Since its first publication, different verses have been added and taken away and, even today, different publications include various selections of verses in various orders. In general, only one verse is sung. Sometimes two verses are sung and, on certain occasions, three.The entire composition is the musical salute for the monarch and royal consort, while other members of the royal family who are entitled to royal salute such as the Prince of Wales, along with his spouse receive just the first six bars. The first six bars also form all or part of the viceregal salute in some Commonwealth realms other than the UK e.g., in Canada, governors general and lieutenant governors at official events are saluted with the first six bars of God Save the King followed by the first four and last four bars of O Canada, as well as the salute given to governors of British overseas territories."

            "9/11 conspiracy theories attribute the preparation and execution of the September 11 attacks against the United States to parties other than, or in addition to, al-Qaeda. These include the theory that high-level government officials had advance knowledge of the attacks. Government investigations and independent reviews have rejected these theories. Proponents of these theories assert that there are inconsistencies in the commonly accepted version, or that there exists evidence that was ignored, concealed, or overlooked.The most prominent conspiracy theory is that the collapse of the Twin Towers and 7 World Trade Center were the result of controlled demolitions rather than structural failure due to impact and fire. Another prominent belief is that the Pentagon was hit by a missile launched by elements from inside the U.S. government, or that hijacked planes were remotely controlled, or that a commercial airliner was allowed to do so via an effective stand-down of the American military. Possible motives claimed by conspiracy theorists for such actions include justifying the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq even though the U.S. government concluded Iraq was not involved in the attacks to advance their geostrategic interests, such as plans to construct a natural gas pipeline through Afghanistan. Other conspiracy theories revolve around authorities having advance knowledge of the attacks and deliberately ignoring or assisting the attackers.The National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST and the technology magazine Popular Mechanics have investigated and rejected the claims made by 9/11 conspiracy theorists. The 9/11 Commission and most of the civil engineering community accept that the impacts of jet aircraft at high speeds in combination with subsequent fires, not controlled demolition, led to the collapse of the Twin Towers, but some conspiracy theory groups, including Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth, disagree with the arguments made by NIST and Popular Mechanics."

Depending upon sense-of-humour, some may use the phrase with mild irony. For example: The two had been fighting for a month, but around others it was all sweetness and light. Esteemed humorous writer P. G. Wodehouse employed the phrase often, sometimes with a slight nod to the phrases dual-edge. \nOriginally, however, sweetness and light had a special use in literary and cultural criticism meaning pleasing and instructive, which in classical theory was considered to be the aim and justification of poetry.Jonathan Swift first used the phrase in his mock-heroic prose satire, The Battle of the Books 1704, a defense of Classical learning, which he published as a prolegomenon to his A Tale of a Tub. It gained widespread currency in the Victorian era, when English poet and essayist Matthew Arnold picked it up as the title of the first section of his 1869 book Culture and Anarchy: An Essay in Political and Social Criticism, where sweetness and light stands for beauty and intelligence, the two key components of an excellent culture."

Klaus Kinski stars in the title role of Spanish soldier Lope de Aguirre, who leads a group of conquistadores down the Amazon River in South America in search of the legendary city of gold, El Dorado. The soundtrack was composed and performed by kosmische band Popol Vuh.\nUsing a minimalist approach to story and dialogue, the film creates a vision of madness and folly, counterpointed by the lush but unforgiving Amazonian jungle. Although loosely based on what is known of the historical figure of Aguirre, Herzog acknowledged years after the films release that its storyline is a work of fiction. Some of the people and situations may have been inspired by Gaspar de Carvajals account of an earlier Amazonian expedition, although Carvajal was not on the historical voyage represented in the film.\nAguirre was the first of five collaborations between Herzog and Kinski. They had differing views as to how the role should be played, and they clashed throughout filming; Kinskis rages terrorized both the crew and the locals who were assisting the production. Shooting was entirely on location, and was fraught with difficulties. Filming took place in the Peruvian rainforest on the Amazon River during an arduous five-week period, shooting on tributaries of the Ucayali region. The cast and crew climbed mountains, cut through heavy vines to open routes to the various jungle locations, and rode treacherous river rapids on rafts built by local craftworkers.\nAguirre opened to widespread critical acclaim, and quickly developed a large international cult film following. It was given an extensive arthouse theatrical release in the United States in 1977, and remains one of the directors best-known films. Several critics have declared the film a masterpiece, and it has appeared on Time magazines list of All Time 100 Best Films."

It stars Humphrey Bogart, Walter Brennan and Lauren Bacall; it also features Dolores Moran, Hoagy Carmichael, Sheldon Leonard, Dan Seymour, and Marcel Dalio. The plot, centered on the romance between a freelancing fisherman in Martinique and a beautiful American drifter, is complicated by the growing French resistance in Vichy France.\nErnest Hemingway and Howard Hawks were close friends and, on a fishing trip, Hawks told Hemingway, who was reluctant to go into screenwriting, that he could make a great movie from his worst book, which Hawks admitted was To Have and Have Not. Jules Furthman wrote the first screenplay, which was set in Cuba like the novel. However, the screenplay was altered to be set in Martinique instead of Cuba because the portrayal of Cubas government was believed to be in violation of the United States Good Neighbor policy with Latin American countries. Hawkss other good friend, William Faulkner, was the main contributor to the screenplay, including and following the revisions. Because of the contributions from both Hemingway and Faulkner, it is the only film story on which two winners of the Nobel Prize for Literature worked. Filming began on February 29, 1944, while Faulkner continued to work on the script, and ended on May 10.\nThe film premiered in New York City on October 11, 1944. Audience reception was generally good. Critic reviews were mixed, with many claiming the film was a remake of Casablanca 1942. Critics specifically mentioned Lauren Bacalls performance or the chemistry between Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall on screen. Bogart and Bacall began an off-screen relationship during production and married in 1945, after the films release.

When the band recorded the song in 1990, Mercurys condition had deteriorated to the point that May had concerns as to whether he was physically capable of singing it. May recalls; I said, Fred, I dont know if this is going to be possible to sing. And he went, Ill fucking do it, darlingvodka downand went in and killed it, completely lacerated that vocal.It was released as a single in the United Kingdom on 14 October 1991 in promotion for the Greatest Hits II album, just six weeks before Mercury died. Following Mercurys death on 24 November 1991, the song re-entered the British charts and spent as many weeks in the top 75 five as it did upon its original release, initially reaching a peak of 16. A live version with Elton John on vocals appeared on Queens Greatest Hits III album.The song was first played live on 20 April 1992, during The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, performed by the three remaining members of Queen, with Elton John singing lead vocals and Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi playing rhythm guitar. It has since been played live by Queen + Paul Rodgers and Queen + Adam Lambert with Rodgers citing one of the performances as the best of his career. Since its release, the song has appeared on television, film including an operatic version in Moulin Rouge!, and has been covered by a number of artists."

This controversy contributed to the production staffs altercations with Nickelodeons Standards and Practices department, in addition to Spmcs failure to deliver episodes on time, all of which led to Kricfalusis termination from the show in 1992. Games Animation would produce the remaining three seasons of the series. One episode was initially left unaired until it was broadcast on MTV on October 20, 1996.\nNevertheless, The Ren & Stimpy Show received very positive reviews during its original run and has since developed a cult following.

It has been used to eulogize victims of hate crimes while protesting the social inequality and institutionalised discrimination that may have led to their deaths. It is a common phrase to use to honor someones legacy, though as an activist. \nAs a leftist alternative in opposition to the traditional Christian phrase rest in peace, rest in power suggests that even in death the deceased person has the power to make a difference to others. The phrase is a statement of solidarity and a call to continue the struggle for social justice, as the deceased person will not be able to rest in peace until society itself is in peace. However, it also implies the hope that the deceased person can now rest, free from oppression."

The plot has a family lost on a vacation road trip through the Texas desert. They become stranded at the lodge of a polygynous pagan cult led by the Master who decides their fate.\nWarren was an insurance and fertilizer salesman from El Paso, Texas, who made the film as a result of a bet with screenwriter Stirling Silliphant. Most of the remaining cast and crew had little or no background in filmmaking. The theatrical debut was poorly received, playing only at the Capri Theater in El Paso and some drive-ins around West Texas and New Mexico.\nManos remained obscure until featured in a 1993 episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000, a television series based on mocking B movies. This developed its cult reputation as one of the worst films ever made. The film has been criticized for continuous deficiencies in editing, continuity, audiovisual synchronization, pacing, and acting, as well as several inexplicable and disconnected scenes, such as a nameless couple repeatedly shown kissing in a distant car and the Masters wives breaking into catfights. Its MST3K appearance resulted in several DVD releases of the original film and three of the MST3K episode. The original 16 mm workprint was discovered in California in 2011, from which a new, remastered version of the film was released on Blu-ray by Synapse Films on October 13, 2015.The film was followed by a prequel, Manos: The Rise of Torgo 2018, and a sequel, Manos Returns 2018.\n\n"

Body snatching from graves and enforced medical experimentation led to the development of African American folklore stories that told of doctors referred to as Night Doctors who would abduct, kill, and dissect bodies. These Night Doctors purpose was to further prevent slaves, freedmen, and black workers from leaving for the Northern United States. The term night doctors is often broadly used, referring to those who steal, buy, or practice on African American corpses to further their medical knowledge. At this time, the cadaver shortage among medical schools in the south led to people digging up their graves in the night to steal bodies, and slave owners selling their deceased to make some extra money. Grave robbing often happened in poor communities where they had no means to have or fund any deterrence of grave robbing or protection of their cemeteries. Night doctors preying on these marginalized communities were often overlooked by wealthier, more powerful people in the communities, and inevitably led to the fleeing of African Americans in the early to mid 20th century, now known as The Great Migration.The African American communitys distrust of the medical occupation and doctors predates the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, where doctors unethically withheld treatment from African Americans with the disease to use them as an experimental basis for untreated syphilis. When night doctors started emerging, the bodies of southern blacks were a valuable resource for dissection and autopsy studies in medical colleges. The horrors night doctors caused continued even after the Civil war as they kept stealing African American bodies for dissection. Unethical practices against African Americans led to fear and distrust in the medical community."

            "The AC Transit Bus fight is an American viral video depicting a physical altercation between two men aboard an AC Transit bus in Oakland, California, on February 15, 2010. The altercation was recorded by a nearby passenger, who uploaded it to video hosting website YouTube. It ranked among the top five most viewed videos on YouTube in its first week, but was not included in the official list, and has received over six million views.\nIn the video, passengers Thomas Bruso and Michael Lovette argue over an unspecified matter, which leads to Lovette throwing a punch and Bruso responding by beating him to the floor. Bruso, nicknamed Epic Beard Man due to his prominent white beard, would become an internet meme and cult hero. The event also raised concerns following a number of previous incidents involving violence on the public transport system in Oakland.The incident inspired the 2012 action film Bad Ass, which starred Danny Trejo as a fictional character similar to Bruso. Two sequels also starring Trejo, Bad Asses and Bad Asses on the Bayou, were released in 2014 and 2015."

It co-stars Richard Crenna as Rambos mentor Sam Trautman and Brian Dennehy as Sheriff Will Teasle. It is the first installment in the Rambo franchise, followed by Rambo: First Blood Part II.\nThe film is based on the 1972 novel First Blood by David Morrell, which many directors and studios had unsuccessfully attempted to adapt in the 1970s. In the film, Rambo is a troubled and misunderstood Vietnam veteran who must rely on his combat and survival skills when a series of brutal events results in him having to survive a massive manhunt by police and government troops near the fictional small town of Hope, Washington.\nFirst Blood was released in the United States on October 22, 1982. Initial reviews were mixed, but the film was a box office success, grossing $156 million at the box office. In 1985, it also became the first Hollywood blockbuster to be released in China, holding the record for the largest number of tickets sold for an American film until 2018. Since its release, it has been reappraised by critics, with many highlighting the roles of Stallone, Dennehy, and Crenna, and recognizing it as an influential film in the action genre.\nIts success spawned a franchise, consisting of four sequels co-written by and starring Stallone, an animated television series, a comic books series, a novel series, several video games, and Indian remakes."

Directed by Chuck Jones and written by Michael Maltese, the cartoon is the first in Jones hunting trilogythe other two cartoons following it being Rabbit Seasoning and Duck! Rabbit, Duck! It is also the first cartoon to feature a feud between Bugs and Daffy. Produced by Edward Selzer for Warner Bros. Cartoons, Inc., the short was released to theaters on May 19, 1951 by Warner Bros. Pictures and is often considered among Jones best and most important films.\nThe film marks a significant shift in Daffys personality, going from being the insane screwball character who like Bugs overwhelmed his adversaries, to be a much more flawed individual, full of greed and vanity and desiring for attention under the spotlight. This personality change, which was previously explored by Jones in You Were Never Duckier and Daffy Dilly, and even earlier in Friz Frelengs You Ought to Be in Pictures, was done in order for Daffy to better serve as Bugs foil. This was fueled by Bugs popularity surpassing Daffys quickly over the years, increasing the desire of the studios animators to pair the two together. \nHowever, Daffy was returned to his original screwball personality in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Looney Tunes: Back in Action in which he got both personalities, Daffys Rhapsody, New Looney Tunes, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Bugs Bunny Builders in which displays both personalities.\n\n"

            "The thirteenth floor is a designation of a level of a multi-level building that is often omitted in countries where the number 13 is considered unlucky. Omitting the 13th floor may take a variety of forms; the most common include denoting what would otherwise be considered the thirteenth floor as level 14, giving the thirteenth floor an alternate designation such as 12A or M the thirteenth letter of the Latin alphabet, or closing the 13th floor to public occupancy or access e.g., by designating it as a mechanical floor.\nReasons for omitting a thirteenth floor include triskaidekaphobia on the part of the buildings owner or builder, or a desire by the building owner or landlord to prevent problems that may arise with superstitious tenants, occupants, or customers. In 2002, based on an internal review of records, Dilip Rangnekar of Otis Elevators estimated that 85% of the buildings with Otis brand elevators did not have a floor named the 13th floor. Early tall-building designers, fearing a fire on the 13th floor, or fearing tenants superstitions about the rumor, decided to omit having a 13th floor listed on their elevator numbering. This practice became commonplace, and eventually found its way into American mainstream culture and building design.Vancouver city planners have banned the practice of skipping 4s and 13s, since it could lead to mistakes by first responders, for example going to the wrong floor."

It was included on their second EP, Mood 2019. The song was produced by Carr. The song is a diss track targeting Mia Khalifa, a Lebanese-American Internet celebrity and former pornographic actress.\nThe decision to write a song dissing Khalifa arose over a misunderstanding. A faked screenshot, intended as a joke, seemed to show Khalifa criticizing Malik for smoking while wearing a hijab in a music video. iLoveFriday and their fans took the apparent hypocrisy seriously. Khalifa has posted a comment on a TikTok post on June 28, 2020, from Khalifas official account miakhalifa stating that This.. is my nightmares. God, this was global, I couldnt escape it. Critics have praised the song for its unconventional catchiness, but it has also been criticized as off-key and misogynistic.Months after its release, Mia Khalifa achieved unexpected viral success on social media, especially among TikTok users. The best-known portion is Maliks verse, which opens with a line that became an Internet meme: Hit or miss, I guess they never miss, huh?"

Pausch had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in September 2006. On September 19, 2006, Pausch underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy to remove the malignant tumor from his pancreas. In August 2007, doctors discovered that the cancer had recurred. Pausch was given a terminal diagnosis and told to expect that three to six months of good health remained.The lecture was upbeat and humorous, alternating between wisecracks, insights on computer science and engineering education, advice on building multi-disciplinary collaborations, working together with other people, offering inspirational life lessons, and performing push-ups on stage. Pausch commented on the irony that the Last Lecture series had recently been renamed Journeys: I thought, damn, I finally nailed the venue and they renamed it. After Pausch finished his lecture, Steve Seabolt, on behalf of Electronic Arts, which was collaborating with CMU in the development of Alice 3.0, pledged to honor Pausch by creating a memorial scholarship for women in computer science, in recognition of Pauschs support and mentoring of women in CS and engineering.\nProfessor Pauschs Last Lecture has received attention and recognition both from American media and news sources worldwide. The video of the speech became an internet sensation, viewed over a million times within its first month on social networking sites such as YouTube, Google video, MySpace, and Facebook. Randy Pausch gave an abridged version of his speech on The Oprah Winfrey Show in October 2007. On April 9, 2008, the ABC network aired an hour-long Diane Sawyer feature on Pausch entitled The Last Lecture: A Love Story For Your Life. Four days after his death from pancreatic cancer on July 25, 2008, ABC aired a tribute to Pausch, remembering his life and his famous lecture."

Sometimes they are used to provide backstory to the matter being discussed at hand, as in Pseudo-Apollodorus Bibliotheke. In the Middle Ages, the excursus is a favourite rhetorical device to allow the narrator to comment or to suspend the action for reflection. Furthermore, an excursus is often applied to a piece of academic writing to provide digressive information, which does not contribute directly to the line of argument but can still be linked with the overall topic of the text."

Her fame began after her daughter, Judy Zimmerman, posted a video of Linder waving to children on a school bus after they had arranged to stop in front of her house to wish her a happy birthday. The event occurred on March 13, two days before her 93rd birthday. Since the beginning of the school year, Linder had either waved from the window of her home, or, in favorable weather, stood on her porch every weekday morning to wave to the bus as it passed by, becoming known as Grandma on the Farm. The bus driver would honk in response; as such, the driver wanted to do something to mark her birthday.Linders routine of waving to the bus was substantially interrupted shortly afterwards as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in schools in the HartleyMelvinSanborn Community School District closing, but she was able to greet the mail person and the driver of the cattle-feed delivery wagon, as she had been doing."

Traditionally, it is sung to bid farewell to the old year at the stroke of midnight on New Years Eve. By extension, it is also often heard at funerals, graduations, and as a farewell or ending to other occasions; for instance, many branches of the Scouting movement use it to close jamborees and other functions.The text is a Scots-language poem written by Robert Burns in 1788 but based on an older Scottish folk song. In 1799, it was set to a traditional tune, which has since become standard. Auld Lang Syne is listed as numbers 6294 and 13892 in the Roud Folk Song Index.\nThe poems Scots title may be translated into standard English as old long since or, less literally, long long ago, days gone by, times long past or old times. Consequently, For auld lang syne, as it appears in the first line of the chorus, might be loosely translated as for the sake of old times.\nThe phrase Auld Lang Syne is also used in similar poems by Robert Ayton 15701638, Allan Ramsay 16861757, and James Watson 1711, as well as older folk songs predating Burns. Matthew Fitt uses the phrase in the days of auld lang syne as the equivalent of once upon a time in his retelling of fairy tales in the Scots language."

In 2007, the inmates of Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center CPDRC, a maximum security prison in Cebu, the Philippines, imitated the zombie dance featured in the music video of Michael Jacksons Thriller. The footage, uploaded onto video-sharing website YouTube, became a viral video. The idea behind the dance came from the prisons chief, Byron F. Garcia. Garcia first conceived the idea of exercising as an enjoyable way of keeping the prisoners mentally and physically fit. Music was then added to provide additional motivation. The convicts marched and danced to several songs, including In the Navy and Y.M.C.A. by the Village People.\nGarcia posted the prisoners dance regimes onto the internet in April 2007. The most popular of the presentations was their Thriller performance. The video showed over 1,500 male inmates emulating Michael Jacksons dance moves from the original Thriller short film. Jackson fan Crisanto Nierre played the role of the pop star, with the openly gay former pizza chef Wenjiel Resane playing his girlfriend. The video became one of the most viewed on the internet, receiving 300,000 views per day at its peak. As of November 12, 2016, the Thriller viral video has received over 57 million reported views. The clip also garnered complaints, with one professor stating that the dancing does not rehabilitate CPDRC inmates. The prison and its officers faced allegations of prisoner abuse, claims which both the officers and inmates denied.\nThe prisoners have performed numerous other songs, including Radio Ga Ga, Together in Electric Dreams, Holding Out for a Hero, and several songs from Sister Act. One of their performances involves the inmates holding portraits of figures such as the Dalai Lama, Pope John Paul II and Mahatma Gandhi. As a result of the prisoners internet fame, many visitors come to CPDRC to view the monthly performances held by the convicts. Their presentations are seen from viewing platforms surrounding the exercise yard. At the jail, visitors can have their pictures taken with the inmates. They can also buy souvenir prison shirts."

            "Westernization or Westernisation, also Europeanisation or occidentalization from the Occident, is a process whereby societies come under or adopt Western culture in areas such as industry, technology, science, education, politics, economics, lifestyle, law, norms, mores, customs, traditions, values, mentality, perceptions, diet, clothing, language, writing system, religion, and philosophy. During colonialism it often involved the spread of Christianity.Westernization has been a growing influence across the world in the last few centuries, with some thinkers assuming Westernization to be the equivalent of modernization, a way of thought that is often debated. The overall process of Westernization is often two-sided in that Western influences and interests themselves are joined with parts of the affected society, at minimum, to become a more Westernized society, with the putative goal of attaining a Western life or some aspects of it, while Western societies are themselves affected by this process and interaction with non-Western groups.\nWesternization traces its roots back to Ancient Greece. Later, the Roman Empire took on on the first process of Westernization as it was heavily influenced by Greece and created a new culture based on the principles and values of the Ancient Greek society. The Romans emerged with a culture that laid the new foundations of Europe and grew into a new Western identity based on the Greco-Roman society.\nWesternization can also be compared to acculturation and enculturation. Acculturation is the process of cultural and psychological change that takes place as a result of contact between cultural groups and their individual members. After contact, changes in cultural patterns are evident within one or both cultures. Specific to Westernization and the non-Western culture, foreign societies tend to adopt changes in their own social systems relative to Western ideology, lifestyle, and physical appearance, along with numerous other aspects, and shifts in culture patterns can be seen to take root as a community becomes acculturated to Western customs and characteristics  in other words, Westernized.\nThe phenomenon of Westernization does not follow any one specific pattern across societies as the degree of adaption and fusion with Western customs will occur at varying magnitudes within different communities. Specifically, the extent to which domination, destruction, resistance, survival, adaptation, or modification affect a native culture may differ following inter-ethnic contact."

It has been recorded in a number of countries and smaller jurisdictions. For example, according to their national censuses, White Americans, White Canadians, White Latin Americans, and White people in the United Kingdom are in demographic decline in the United States, Canada, Latin America, and the United Kingdom, respectively.\nScholars have attempted to address subfactors and anticipated results of White demographic decline in relevant societies. The term majority minority has been used to designate an area where a decline, of what are nationally defined as Whites, has resulted in a former majority becoming a minority. Examples of this include parts of the United States and Brazil. Other notable concepts include demographer Eric Kaufmanns theory of Whiteshift, which predicts transforming classifications of Whiteness as mixed-race majorities emerge, and social psychologist Jennifer Richesons research into racial shift conditions, which outline how White peoples hostility to other racial groups increases in proportion to their awareness of a drop in White population share.\nExperts in extremism and terrorism have shown national demography in relation to white people to be subject to exploitation by both radical and political right-wing groups, including adherence to conspiracy theories. This has also manifested as anti-abortion, and anti-immigrant sentiment despite academic evidence that immigration significantly contributes to the maintenance of economies, civic institutions, and population-levels of places affected by White demographic decline, such as in the Southern United States."

It is studied by geographers and historians.\nTwo major eras of exploration occurred in human history: one of convergence, and one of divergence. The first, covering most of Homo sapiens history, saw humans moving out of Africa, settling in new lands, and developing distinct cultures in relative isolation. Early explorers settled in Europe and Asia; 14,000 years ago, some crossed the Ice Age land bridge from Siberia to Alaska, and moved southbound to settle in the Americas. For the most part, these cultures were ignorant of each others existence. The second period of exploration, occurring over the last 10,000 years, saw increased cross-cultural exchange through trade and exploration, and marked a new era of cultural intermingling, and more recently, convergence.Early writings about exploration date back to the 4th millennium B.C. in ancient Egypt. One of the earliest and most impactful thinkers of exploration was Ptolemy in 2nd century AD, Between the 5th century and 15th century AD, most exploration was done by Chinese and Arab explorers. This was followed by the European Age of Discovery after European scholars rediscovered the works of early Latin and Greek geographers. While the Age of Discovery was partly driven by European land routes becoming unsafe, and a desire for conquest, the 17th century saw exploration driven by nobler motives, including scientific discovery and the expansion of knowledge about the world. This broader knowledge of the worlds geography meant that people were able to make world maps, depicting all land known. The first modern atlas was the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, published by Abraham Ortelius, which included a world map that depicted all of Earths continents.:32"

            "Tip of the tongue also known as lethologica is the phenomenon of failing to retrieve a word or term from memory, combined with partial recall and the feeling that retrieval is imminent. The phenomenons name comes from the saying, Its on the tip of my tongue. The tip of the tongue phenomenon reveals that lexical access occurs in stages.People experiencing the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon can often recall one or more features of the target word, such as the first letter, its syllabic stress, and words similar in sound, meaning, or both sound and meaning. Individuals report a feeling of being seized by the state, feeling something like mild anguish while searching for the word, and a sense of relief when the word is found. While many aspects of the tip-of-the-tongue state remain unclear, there are two major competing explanations for its occurrence: the direct-access view and the inferential view. Emotion and the strength of the emotional ties to what is trying to be remembered can also have an impact on the TOT phenomenon. The stronger the emotional ties, the longer it takes to retrieve the item from memory.TOT states should be distinguished from FOK feeling of knowing states. FOK, in contrast, is the feeling that one will be able to recognizefrom a list of itemsan item that is currently inaccessible. There are still currently opposing hypotheses in the psychological literature regarding the separability of the process underlying these concepts. However, there is some evidence that TOTs and FOKs draw on different parts of the brain. TOTs are associated with the anterior cingulate, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and right inferior cortex while FOKs are not. FOKs can be assessed through memory-monitoring testing in which a test subject is asked to estimate the likelihood of recognizing when prompted with a cue or information that they previously failed to remember. This test aims to measure a test subjects accuracy of memory monitoring during the memory extraction stage.An occasional tip-of-the-tongue state is normal for people of all ages; however, it becomes more frequent as people age. TOT can be referred as an actual medical condition, but only when it becomes frequent enough to interfere with learning or daily life. This disorder is called anomic aphasia when acquired by brain damage, usually from a head injury, stroke, or dementia.The tip of the tongue phenomenon has implications for research in psycholinguistics, memory, and metacognition."

The story is set against the conditions that led up to the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror. In the Introduction to the Encyclopedia of Adventure Fiction, critic Don DAmmassa argues that it is an adventure novel because the protagonists are in constant danger of being imprisoned or killed.As Dickenss best-known work of historical fiction, A Tale of Two Cities is said to be one of the best-selling novels of all time. In 2003, the novel was ranked 63rd on the BBCs The Big Read poll. The novel has been adapted for film, television, radio, and the stage, and has continued to influence popular culture."

Lugosi portrays Count Dracula, a vampire who emigrates from Transylvania to England and preys upon the blood of living victims, including a young mans fiance.\nProduced and distributed by Universal Pictures, Dracula is the first sound film adaptation of the Stoker novel. Several actors were considered to portray the title character, but Lugosi, who had previously played the role on Broadway, eventually got the part. The film was partially shot on sets at Universal Studios Lot in California, which were reused at night for the filming of Dracula, a concurrently produced Spanish-language version of the story also by Universal.\nDracula was a commercial and critical success upon release, and led to several sequels and spin-offs. It has had a notable influence on popular culture, and Lugosis portrayal of Dracula established the character as a cultural icon, as well as the archetypal vampire in later works of fiction. In 2000, the film was selected by the United States Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry as culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\n\n"

Written by Michael Wilson and Rod Serling, it stars Charlton Heston, Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter, Maurice Evans, James Whitmore, James Daly and Linda Harrison. In the film, an astronaut crew crash-lands on a strange planet in the distant future. Although the planet appears desolate at first, the surviving crew members stumble upon a society in which apes have evolved into creatures with human-like intelligence and speech. The apes have assumed the role of the dominant species and humans are mute creatures wearing animal skins.\nThe outline Planet of the Apes script, originally written by Serling, underwent many rewrites before filming eventually began. Directors J. Lee Thompson and Blake Edwards were approached, but the films producer Arthur P. Jacobs, upon the recommendation of Charlton Heston, chose Franklin J. Schaffner to direct the film. Schaffners changes included an ape society less advancedand therefore less expensive to depictthan that of the original novel. Filming took place between May 21 and August 10, 1967, in California, Utah and Arizona, with desert sequences shot in and around Lake Powell, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. The films final closed cost was $5.8 million.\nThe film was released in the United States on February 8, 1968, and was a commercial success, earning a lifetime domestic gross of $32.605 million. The film was groundbreaking for its prosthetic makeup techniques by artist John Chambers and was well received by critics and audiences, launching a film franchise, including four sequels, as well as a short-lived television show, animated series, comic books, and various merchandising. In particular, Roddy McDowall had a long-running relationship with the Apes series, appearing in four of the original five films he was absent from the second film of the series, Beneath the Planet of the Apes, in which he was replaced by David Watson in the role of Cornelius, and also in the television series.\nThe original series was followed by Tim Burtons remake Planet of the Apes in 2001 and the reboot series began with Rise of the Planet of the Apes in 2011. In 2001, Planet of the Apes was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."

            "The parable of the blind men and an elephant is a story of a group of blind men who have never come across an elephant before and who learn and imagine what the elephant is like by touching it. Each blind man feels a different part of the elephants body, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then describe the elephant based on their limited experience and their descriptions of the elephant are different from each other. In some versions, they come to suspect that the other person is dishonest and they come to blows. The moral of the parable is that humans have a tendency to claim absolute truth based on their limited, subjective experience as they ignore other peoples limited, subjective experiences which may be equally true. The parable originated in the ancient Indian subcontinent, from where it has been widely diffused. \nThe Buddhist text Tittha Sutta, Udna 6.4, Khuddaka Nikaya, contains one of the earliest versions of the story. The Tittha sutta is dated to around c.500 BCE, during the lifetime of the Buddha.An alternative version of the parable describes sighted men, experiencing a large statue on a dark night, or feeling a large object while being blindfolded. They then describe what it is they have experienced. In its various versions, it is a parable that has crossed between many religious traditions and is part of Jain, Hindu and Buddhist texts of 1st millennium CE or before. The story also appears in 2nd millennium Sufi and Bah Faith lore. The tale later became well known in Europe, with 19th century American poet John Godfrey Saxe creating his own version as a poem, with a final verse that explains that the elephant is a metaphor for God, and the various blind men represent religions that disagree on something no one has fully experienced. The story has been published in many books for adults and children, and interpreted in a variety of ways."

            "The Harlem Shake is an Internet meme in the form of a video in which a group of people dance to a short excerpt from the song Harlem Shake. The meme became viral in early February 2013, with thousands of Harlem Shake videos being made and uploaded to YouTube every day at the height of its popularity.Despite its name, the meme does not actually involve participants performing the original Harlem Shake dance, a street and hip hop dance that originated in 1980s Harlem, New York City; rather, the meme usually features participants performing flailing or convulsive movements. The meme form was established in a video uploaded on February 2, 2013, by YouTube personality George Miller on his DizastaMusic channel. The video featured the character Pink Guy from The Filthy Frank Show entitled Filthy Compilation #6 - Smell My Fingers, which featured a section where several costumed people danced to the song Harlem Shake by Baauer. The video opens with the first use of the Harlem Shake meme, and started a viral trend of people uploading their own Harlem Shake videos to YouTube."

            "The embarrassing cheque is a confidence trick which may also be an urban legend.\nThe scam was supposedly performed by a company selling pornography or other sex aids and trading under a highly explicit name. Customers were invited to purchase adult material from the company, and were assured that the actual transaction could be made with a separate company with a non-explicit name in order to prevent the explicit name from appearing on transaction logs and bank statements. \nIn fact, the company did not have any items to sell. Once a sufficient number of customers had sent money for items, the company sent out letters of apology to all of them, saying the items were no longer available. They also sent them refunds - in the form of company cheques clearly printed with the explicit company name.\nThe plan would be that the customers would be too embarrassed to cash in a cheque showing the companys real name The Anal Sex And Fetish Pornography Company, not wanting other persons to know about their private lives, so the cheques would never be cashed, and thus the scammers running the company got to keep the money. The authors of snopes.com have pointed out that customers could cash the cheques via ATM or mail and thus avoid having to confront a bank worker in person. This would not have prevented, however, the cheque description potentially appearing on their customer file.\nIt is not known if this trick ever actually happened or not. It is referred to in the film Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels and the TV series Eureka Street but existed as a legend prior to that."

            "The term formalism describes an emphasis on form over content or meaning in the arts, literature, or philosophy. A practitioner of formalism is called a formalist. A formalist, with respect to some discipline, holds that there is no transcendent meaning to that discipline other than the literal content created by a practitioner. For example, formalists within mathematics claim that mathematics is no more than the symbols written down by the mathematician, which is based on logic and a few elementary rules alone. This is as opposed to non-formalists, within that field, who hold that there are some things inherently true, and are not, necessarily, dependent on the symbols within mathematics so much as a greater truth. Formalists within a discipline are completely concerned with the rules of the game, as there is no other external truth that can be achieved beyond those given rules. In this sense, formalism lends itself well to disciplines based upon axiomatic systems.\n\n"

            "Middle Ages",
            "In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted approximately from the late 5th to the late 15th centuries, similar to the post-classical period of global history. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and transitioned into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages.\nPopulation decline, counterurbanisation, the collapse of centralized authority, invasions, and mass migrations of tribes, which had begun in late antiquity, continued into the Early Middle Ages. The large-scale movements of the Migration Period, including various Germanic peoples, formed new kingdoms in what remained of the Western Roman Empire. In the 7th century, North Africa and the Middle Eastmost recently part of the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empirecame under the rule of the Umayyad Caliphate, an Islamic empire, after conquest by Muhammads successors. Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures, the break with classical antiquity was not complete. The still-sizeable Byzantine Empire, Romes direct continuation, survived in the Eastern Mediterranean and remained a major power. Secular law was advanced greatly by the Code of Justinian. In the West, most kingdoms incorporated extant Roman institutions, while new bishoprics and monasteries were founded as Christianity expanded in Europe. The Franks, under the Carolingian dynasty, briefly established the Carolingian Empire during the later 8th and early 9th centuries. It covered much of Western Europe but later succumbed to the pressures of internal civil wars combined with external invasions: Vikings from the north, Magyars from the east, and Saracens from the south.\nDuring the High Middle Ages, which began after 1000, the population of Europe increased greatly as technological and agricultural innovations allowed trade to flourish and the Medieval Warm Period climate change allowed crop yields to increase. Manorialism, the organisation of peasants into villages that owed rent and labour services to the nobles, and feudalism, the political structure whereby knights and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords in return for the right to rent from lands and manors, were two of the ways society was organised in the High Middle Ages. This period also saw the formal division of the Catholic and Orthodox churches, with the EastWest Schism of 1054. The Crusades, which began in 1095, were military attempts by Western European Christians to regain control of the Holy Land from Muslims, and also contributed to the expansion of Latin Christendom in the Baltic region and the Iberian Peninsula. Kings became the heads of centralised nation states, reducing crime and violence but making the ideal of a unified Christendom more distant. In the West, intellectual life was marked by scholasticism, a philosophy that emphasised joining faith to reason, and by the founding of universities. The theology of Thomas Aquinas, the paintings of Giotto, the poetry of Dante and Chaucer, the travels of Marco Polo, and the Gothic architecture of cathedrals such as Chartres mark the end of this period.\nThe Late Middle Ages was marked by difficulties and calamities including famine, plague, and war, which significantly diminished the population of Europe; between 1347 and 1350, the Black Death killed about a third of Europeans. Controversy, heresy, and the Western Schism within the Catholic Church paralleled the interstate conflict, civil strife, and peasant revolts that occurred in the kingdoms. Cultural and technological developments transformed European society, concluding the Late Middle Ages and beginning the early modern period."

            "Monty Pythons Flying Circus also known as simply Monty Python is a British surreal sketch comedy series created by and starring Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam, who became known as Monty Python, or the Pythons. The first episode was recorded at the BBC on 7 September 1969 and premiered on 5 October on BBC1, with 45 episodes airing over four series from 1969 to 1974, plus two episodes for German TV.\nThe series stands out for its use of absurd situations, mixed with risqu and innuendo-laden humour, sight gags and observational sketches without punchlines. Live action segments were broken up with animations by Gilliam, often merging with the live action to form segues. The overall format used for the series followed and elaborated upon the style used by Spike Milligan in his groundbreaking series Q.., rather than the traditional sketch show format. The Pythons play the majority of the series characters themselves, along with supporting cast members including Carol Cleveland referred to by the team as the unofficial Seventh Python, Connie Booth Cleeses first wife, series producer Ian MacNaughton, Ian Davidson, musician Neil Innes, and Fred Tomlinson and the Fred Tomlinson Singers for musical numbers.The programme came about as the six Pythons, having met each other through university and in various radio and television programmes in the 1960s, sought to make a new sketch comedy show unlike anything else on British television at the time. Much of the humour in the series various episodes and sketches targets the idiosyncrasies of British life, especially that of professionals, as well as aspects of politics. Their comedy is often pointedly intellectual, with numerous erudite references to philosophers and literary figures and their works. The team intended their humour to be impossible to categorise, and succeeded although, by their perspective, failed so completely that the adjective Pythonesque was invented to define it and, later, similar material. However, their humour was not always seen as appropriate for television by the BBC, leading to some censorship during the third series. Cleese left the show following that series, and the remaining Pythons completed a final shortened fourth series before ending the show.\nThe show became very popular in the United Kingdom, and after initially failing to draw an audience in the United States, gained American popularity after member stations of PBS Public Broadcasting Service began airing the show in 1974. The success on both sides of the Atlantic led to the Pythons going on live tours and creating three additional films, while the individual Pythons flourished in solo careers. Monty Pythons Flying Circus has become an influential work on comedy as well as the ongoing popular culture."

            "Dawn of the Dead is a 1978 zombie horror film written, directed, and edited by George A. Romero, and produced by Richard P. Rubinstein. An American-Italian international co-production, it is the second film in Romeros series of zombie films, and though it contains no characters or settings from the preceding film Night of the Living Dead 1968, it shows the larger-scale effects of a zombie apocalypse on society. In the film, a phenomenon of unidentified origin has caused the reanimation of the dead, who prey on human flesh. David Emge, Ken Foree, Scott Reiniger, and Gaylen Ross star as survivors of the outbreak who barricade themselves inside a suburban shopping mall amid mass hysteria.\nRomero waited to make another zombie film after Night of the Living Dead for several years to avoid being stereotyped as a horror director. Upon visiting Monroeville Mall in Monroeville, Pennsylvania with a friend whose company managed the complex, he decided to use the location as the basis for the films story. The project came to the attention of Italian filmmaker Dario Argento who, along with his brother Claudio and producer Alfredo Cuomo, agreed to co-finance the film in exchange for its international distribution rights. Argento also consulted with Romero during the scriptwriting phase. Principal photography on Dawn of the Dead took place between November 1977 and February 1978 on location in Monroeville and Pittsburgh. The special make-up effects were created by Tom Savini, whose work on the film led to an extensive career creating similar effects for other horror films. In post-production, Romero and Argento edited separate versions of the film for their respective markets. Argentos version features a progressive rock score composed and performed by his frequent collaborators Goblin, while Romeros cut primarily favors stock cues from the De Wolfe Music Library.\nFollowing its Italian premiere on September 1, 1978, Dawn of the Dead was released in other markets the following year. Despite facing difficulties with various national censorship boards  in the United States, it was released unrated to improve its commercial prospects after it was given an X by the Motion Picture Association of America, and in Britain it was liable for seizure during the 1980s video nasties moral panic  the film proved to be a major success at the box office, grossing $66 million worldwide against its estimated budget of $640,000. Noted for its satirical portrayal of consumerism, Dawn of the Dead has received widespread critical acclaim since its initial release, and is widely considered to be one of the greatest horror films ever made, as well as the greatest zombie film. Like its predecessor, it has garnered a large, international cult following. In 2008, it was chosen by Empire magazine as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time, along with Night of the Living Dead.Dawn of the Dead was followed by four official sequels, beginning with 1985s Day of the Dead, and a separate series of unofficial Italian-made sequels, beginning with 1979s Zombi 2. It has also inspired a 2004 remake directed by Zack Snyder, as well as numerous parodies and pop culture references."

After the first Germans climbed up the Acropolis, an officer ordered him to surrender, give up the Greek flag and raise the Nazi swastika flag in its place.

A commemorative plaque near the spot marks the event.\nDuring a television programme on 26 April 2000, the then mayor of Athens Dimitris Avramopoulos, stated that there was no specific documentary evidence on Koukidis or his deed. It was noted that a heroic legend of this nature had been important in maintaining national morale under a harsh occupation. On the same occasion, Lieutenant General Ioannis Kakoudakis, Director of the Department of the History of the Army, reported that an investigation had failed to confirm the existence of this soldier.

It was first broadcast on 17 January 1991 on Leningrad Television.The hoax took the form of an interview on the television program Pyatoe Koleso The Fifth Wheel. In the interview, Kuryokhin, impersonating a historian, narrated his findings that Vladimir Lenin consumed large quantities of psychedelic mushrooms and eventually became a mushroom himself. Kuryokhin arrived at his conclusion through a long series of logical fallacies and appeals to the authority of various sources such as Carlos Castaneda, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, creating the illusion of a reasoned and plausible logical chain.\nThe timing of the hoax played a large role in its success, coming as it did during the glasnost period when the ebbing of censorship in the Soviet Union led to many revelations about the countrys history, often presented in sensational form. Furthermore, Soviet television had, up to that point, been regarded by its audience as conservative in style and content. As a result, a large number of Soviet citizens one estimate puts the number at 11.3 million audience members took the deadpan interview at face value, in spite of the absurd claims presented.\nSholokhov has said that perhaps the most notable result of the show was an appeal by a group of party members to the Leningrad Regional Committee of the CPSU to clarify the veracity of Kuryokhins claim. According to Sholokhov, in response to the request one of the top regional functionaries stated that Lenin could not have been a mushroom because a mammal cannot be a plant. Modern taxonomy classifies mushrooms as fungi, a separate kingdom from plants."

            "A Mexican standoff is a confrontation in which no strategy exists that allows any party to achieve victory. Any party initiating aggression might trigger its own demise. At the same time, the parties are unable to extricate themselves from the situation without suffering a loss. As a result, all participants need to maintain the strategic tension, which remains unresolved until some outside event or interparty dialogue makes it possible to resolve it.\nThe term Mexican standoff was originally used in the context of using firearms and it still commonly implies a situation in which the parties face some form of threat from the other parties. The Mexican standoff is a recurring trope in cinema, in which several armed characters hold each other at gunpoint."

Over the course of the work, she becomes greatly disillusioned with her Muslim faith, as seen in this passage where she grieves over the loss of her husbands right hand by Roland:\n\nWhen the Queen Bramimonde heard that her lord had returned, she hurried to him. Then, as she listened to his woful tale, and saw his shattered wrist, from which the right hand was gone, she wept aloud and made a great moan. With terrible curses she cursed Charlemagne and Francia, and she cursed her own heathen gods and idols. Then she threw the image of Apollin down, taking from him his crown and sceptre and trampling him under foot. Oh, wicked god, she cried, why hast thou brought such shame upon us? Why hast thou allowed our king to be defeated? Thou rewardest but ill those who serve thee.The images of Tervagan and Mahomet too she caused to be beaten and broken in pieces, and flung to the pigs and dogs. Never were idols treated with such scorn. Upon Charlemagnes armys successful destruction of her citys mosques and synagogues, the forced baptism of her people, the crushing defeat of Baligant, and finally the death of her husband, she readily admits defeat. She is captured and taken to Aix upon her surrender and, unlike her subjects, is allowed to convert to the Christian faith by parable and sermon in recognition of her noble lineage. She was baptised as Juliana."

            "Love means never having to say youre sorry is a catchphrase based on a line from the Erich Segal novel Love Story and was popularized by its 1970 film adaptation starring Ali MacGraw and Ryan ONeal. The line is spoken twice in the film: once in the middle of the film, by Jennifer Cavalleri MacGraws character, when Oliver Barrett ONeal apologizes to her for his anger; and as the last line of the film, by Oliver, when his father says Im sorry after learning of Jennifers death. In the script, the line is phrased slightly differently: Love means not ever having to say youre sorry.\nThe line proved memorable, and has been repeated in various contexts since. In 2005, it was voted #13 in the American Film Institutes list AFIs 100 Years.. 100 Movie Quotes. The band Sounds of Sunshine had a Top 40 hit in the United States with a song titled Love Means You Never Have to Say Youre Sorry in 1971. Love means never having to say youre.. is the opening sentence in the popular song Cant Help but Love You by The Whispers, from their album named after the movie, issued in 1972.\nThe line has also been criticized or mocked for suggesting that apologies are unnecessary in a loving relationship. Another character played by ONeal disparages it in the 1972 screwball comedy Whats Up, Doc?: in that films final scene, Barbra Streisands character says Love means never having to say youre sorry. and bats her eyelashes, and ONeals character responds in a flat deadpan voice, Thats the dumbest thing I ever heard.\nMacGraw has said that she always hated the line and considered it ridiculous."

Speech of this sort is used to make light of the situation or to re-affirm the speakers masculinity or bush skills to the detriment of others.\nThe Speewah station in The Kimberleys, Western Australia, is considered by some to be the original Speewah of legend, but may merely have been named after the legend in homage.

Depending on the version of Minecraft, players have a chance of spawning as either Steve or Alex when starting a new game.\nSteve became a widely recognized character in the video game industry following the critical and commercial success of the Minecraft franchise. Considered by some critics as a mascot for the Minecraft intellectual property, his likeness has appeared extensively in advertising and merchandise, including wearable apparel and collectible items. The character has also inspired a number of unofficial media and urban legends, most notably the Herobrine creepypasta which became widely shared around internet communities as a meme during the 2010s."

Loosely based on the 1929 novel of the same name and serving as a loose remake of the 1932 film, it tells the story of Cuban refugee Tony Montana Al Pacino, who arrives penniless in Miami during the Mariel boatlift and becomes a powerful and extremely homicidal drug lord. The film co-stars Steven Bauer, Michelle Pfeiffer, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Robert Loggia. De Palma dedicated this version of Scarface to the writers of the original film, Howard Hawks and Ben Hecht.Pacino became interested in a remake of the 1932 version after seeing it, and he and producer Martin Bregman began to develop it. Sidney Lumet was initially hired to direct the film but was replaced by De Palma, who hired Stone to write the script. Filming took place from November 1982 to May 1983, in Los Angeles and Miami. The films soundtrack was composed by Giorgio Moroder.\nScarface premiered in New York City on December 1, 1983, and was released on December 9 by Universal Pictures. The film grossed $45 million at the domestic box office and $66 million worldwide. Initial critical reception was negative due to its excessive violence, profanity, and graphic drug usage. Some Cuban expatriates in Miami objected to the films portrayal of Cubans as criminals and drug traffickers. In the years that followed, critics have reappraised it, and it is now considered one of the greatest gangster films ever made. Screenwriters and directors such as Martin Scorsese have praised the film, and it has been referenced extensively in pop culture, especially in hip hop music, as well as comic books, television programs, and video games. The film has come to be regarded as a cult classic."

The term was introduced into scientific literature by Franois E. Matthes in 1939. The period has been conventionally defined as extending from the 16th to the 19th centuries, but some experts prefer an alternative timespan from about 1300 to about 1850.The NASA Earth Observatory notes three particularly cold intervals. One began about 1650, another about 1770, and the last in 1850, all of which were separated by intervals of slight warming. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Third Assessment Report considered that the timing and the areas affected by the Little Ice Age suggested largely independent regional climate changes, rather than a globally synchronous increased glaciation. At most, there was modest cooling of the Northern Hemisphere during the period.Several causes have been proposed: cyclical lows in solar radiation, heightened volcanic activity, changes in the ocean circulation, variations in Earths orbit and axial tilt orbital forcing, inherent variability in global climate, and decreases in the human population such as from the Black Death and the epidemics emerging in the Americas upon European contact."

The stream became unexpectedly popular, reaching an average concurrent viewership of over 80,000 viewers with at least 10% participating. On 1 March 2014, the game was completed after more than 16 continuous days of gameplay; Twitch estimated that over 1.16 million people participated, with peak simultaneous participation at 121,000, and with a total of 55 million views during the experiment. On 5 December 2014, Twitch Plays Pokmon received a Game Award in the Best Fan Creation category.The experiment was met with attention by media outlets and staff members of Twitch for its interactivity, its erratic and chaotic nature, the unique challenges faced by players due to the mechanics of its system, and the community and memes developed by participants. Twitch as a company used the experiment to explore how they could make streaming more interactive for viewers and expand their offerings. Following the completion of Red, the broadcaster continued the channel with many other games in the Pokmon series along with unofficial ROM hacks. The broadcaster has plans to continue with other Pokmon games as long as there remains interest in the channel. The success of the experiment led to a number of similar Twitch-based streams for other games, and led Twitch to promote more streams with similar interactivity with watchers."

            "Inscape and instress are complementary and enigmatic concepts about individuality and uniqueness derived by the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins from the ideas of the medieval philosopher Duns Scotus. Inscape has been rendered variously as: external design, aesthetic conception, intrinsic beauty, the intrinsic form of a thing, a form perceived in nature, the individual self, the expression of the inner core of individuality, the peculiar inner nature of things and persons, expressed in form and gesture, and an essence or identity embodied in a thing. These twin concepts are what his most famous poems are about.\n\nHopkins felt that everything in the universe was characterized by what he called inscape, the distinctive design that constitutes individual identity. This identity is not static but dynamic. Each being in the universe selves, that is, enacts its identity. And the human being, the most highly selved, the most individually distinctive being in the universe, recognizes the inscape of other beings in an act that Hopkins calls instress, the apprehension of an object in an intense thrust of energy toward it that enables one to realize specific distinctiveness. Ultimately, the instress of inscape leads one to Christ, for the individual identity of any object is the stamp of divine creation on it.\n\nThis is related to a logocentric theology and the Imago Dei. A logocentric theology of creation is based on correlation of the Genesis account and John 1. Since all creation is by the Word divine fiat human identity in Gods image is grounded in Gods speech and no two creation words are ever spoken alike. This idea is reflected by J. R. R. Tolkien who compares the Creator to a perfect prism and creation to the refraction of perfect light. Tolkien writes,\n\nDear Sir, I said  Although now long estranged,\nMan is not wholly lost nor wholly changed\nDis-graced he may be, yet is not de-throned,\nand keeps the rags of lordship once he owned:\nMan, Sub-creator, the refracted Light\nthrough whom is splintered from a single White\nto many hues, and endlessly combined\nin living shapes that move from mind to mind.The idea is strongly embraced by the Trappist monk and author Thomas Merton who admired both Scotus and Hopkins. In New Seeds of Contemplation Merton equates the unique thingness of a thing, its inscape, to sanctity. Merton writes,\nNo two created beings are exactly alike. And their individuality is no imperfection. On the contrary, the perfection of each created thing is not merely its conformity to an abstract type but in its own individual identity with itself.The result is that holiness itself is grounded in Gods creation, his call, and not in a Platonic ideal. To the extent that any thing including humans honors Gods unique idea of them they are holy. Holiness thus connects to vocation from the Latin vocare for voice in two ways. First, God creates through the word; and second, when being responds rightly to Gods speech by expressing his unique word the result is Holiness."

This concept was first formulated by Dionysius of Halicarnassus in the first century BCE as imitatio, and has since dominated for almost two thousand years the Western history of the arts and classicism. Plato has regarded imitation as a general principle of art, as he viewed art itself as an imitation of life. This theory was popular and well accepted during the classical period. During the Renaissance period, imitation was seen as a means of obtaining ones personal style; this was alluded to by the artists of that era like Cennino Cennini, Petrarch and Pier Paolo Vergerio. In the 18th century, Romanticism reversed it with the creation of the institution of romantic originality. In the 20th century, the modernist and postmodern movements in turn discarded the romantic idea of creativity, and heightened the practice of imitation, copying, plagiarism, rewriting, appropriation and so on as the central artistic device."

            "Operational amplifier",
            "An operational amplifier op amp or opamp is a DC-coupled high-gain electronic voltage amplifier with a differential input and, usually, a single-ended output. In this configuration, an op amp produces an output potential relative to circuit ground that is several orders of magnitude times larger than the potential difference between its input terminals. The operational amplifier traces its origin and name to analog computers, where they were used to perform mathematical operations in linear, non-linear, and frequency-dependent circuits. \nThe popularity of the op amp as a building block in analog circuits is due to its versatility. By using negative feedback, the characteristics of an op-amp circuit, its gain, input and output impedance, bandwidth etc. are determined by external components and have little dependence on temperature coefficients or engineering tolerance in the op amp itself.\nOp amps are used widely in electronic devices today, including a vast array of consumer, industrial, and scientific devices. Many standard integrated circuit op amps cost only a few cents; however, some integrated or hybrid operational amplifiers with special performance specifications may cost over US$100 in small quantities. Op amps may be packaged as components or used as elements of more complex integrated circuits.\nThe op amp is one type of differential amplifier. Other types of differential amplifier include the fully differential amplifier an op amp with a differential rather than single-ended output, the instrumentation amplifier usually built from three op amps, the isolation amplifier with galvanic isolation between input and output, and negative-feedback amplifier usually built from one or more op amps and a resistive feedback network.\n\n"

            "Jaws (film)",
            "Jaws is a 1975 American thriller film directed by Steven Spielberg, based on the 1974 novel by Peter Benchley. It stars Roy Scheider as police chief Martin Brody, who, with the help of a marine biologist Richard Dreyfuss and a professional shark hunter Robert Shaw, hunts a man-eating great white shark that attacks beachgoers at a summer resort town. Murray Hamilton plays the mayor, and Lorraine Gary portrays Brodys wife. The screenplay is credited to Benchley, who wrote the first drafts, and actor-writer Carl Gottlieb, who rewrote the script during principal photography.\nShot mostly on location on Marthas Vineyard in Massachusetts, Jaws was the first major motion picture to be shot on the ocean, and consequently had a troubled production with issues such as going over budget and past schedule. As the art departments mechanical sharks often malfunctioned, Spielberg decided mostly to suggest the sharks presence, employing an ominous and minimalist theme created by composer John Williams to indicate its impending appearances. Spielberg and others have compared this suggestive approach to that of director Alfred Hitchcock. Universal Pictures release of the film to over 450 screens was an exceptionally wide release for a major studio picture at the time, and it was accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign that heavily emphasized television spots and tie-in merchandise.\nRegarded as a watershed moment in motion picture history, Jaws was the prototypical summer blockbuster, and won several awards for its music and editing. It was the highest-grossing film of all time until the release of Star Wars two years later; both films were pivotal in establishing the modern Hollywood business model, which pursues high box-office returns from action and adventure films with simple high-concept premises, released during the summer in thousands of theaters and advertised heavily. Jaws was followed by three sequels none of which involved Spielberg or Benchley and many imitative thrillers, and in 2001, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the United States National Film Registry."

            "Papas Got a Brand New Bag is a song written and recorded by James Brown. Released as a two-part single in 1965, it was Browns first song to reach the Billboard Hot 100 Top Ten, peaking at number eight, and was a number-one R&B hit, topping the charts for eight weeks. It won Brown his first Grammy Award, for Best Rhythm & Blues Recording.Consolidating the rhythmic innovations of earlier James Brown recordings such as Ive Got Money and Out of Sight, Papas Got a Brand New Bag is considered seminal in the emergence of funk music as a distinct style. As Brown sings the praises of an old man brave enough to get out on the dance floor of a nightclub brand new bag meaning new interest, taste, or way of doing something, his band provides a horn-heavy backdrop with a prominent rhythm and an electric guitar riff for a hook. Both singer and musicians place overwhelming emphasis on the first beat of each measure on the One. The song is Browns first recording to feature Jimmy Nolen on guitar.\nThe taped recording of Papas Got a Brand New Bag was edited and sped up for its single release, increasing the tempo and raising the pitch by a half step. In 1991, the recording was released in unedited form at its original speed on the box set Star Time. The track includes lead-in studio chatter, with Brown throatily and presciently shouting This is a hit! just before the drum and horn intro."

            "Mommie Dearest is a 1981 American biographical psychological drama film directed by Frank Perry. The film depicts Christina Crawfords adoptive mother, actress Joan Crawford, as an abusive and manipulative mother.\nStarring Faye Dunaway, Mara Hobel, and Diana Scarwid, the film was adapted for the screen by Robert Getchell, Tracy Hotchner, Frank Perry, and Frank Yablans from Christinas 1978 autobiography of the same name. The executive producers were Christinas husband, David Koontz, and Terry ONeill, Dunaways then-boyfriend and soon-to-be husband. The film was distributed by Paramount Pictures, the only one of the Big Eight film studios for which Crawford had never appeared in a feature film.\nThe film was a commercial failure, grossing just over $19 million in North America from a $10 million budget. Despite receiving mostly negative reviews from critics, the films perceived bizarre script and highly charged acting, particularly Dunaways, have brought a cult following to the film as an unintentional comedy. It is often considered to be one of the worst films ever made. It was nominated for nine Razzies at the 2nd Golden Raspberry Awards, and won five, including Worst Picture."

It is inspired by the life story of Spartacus, the leader of a slave revolt in antiquity, and the events of the Third Servile War. It stars Kirk Douglas in the title role, Laurence Olivier as Roman general and politician Marcus Licinius Crassus, Peter Ustinov as slave trader Lentulus Batiatus, John Gavin as Julius Caesar, Jean Simmons as Varinia, Charles Laughton as Sempronius Gracchus, and Tony Curtis as Antoninus.\nDouglas, whose company Bryna Productions was producing the film, removed original director Anthony Mann after the first week of shooting. Kubrick, with whom Douglas had made Paths of Glory 1957, was brought on board to take over direction. It was the only film directed by Kubrick where he did not have complete artistic control. Screenwriter Dalton Trumbo was blacklisted at the time as one of the Hollywood Ten. Douglas publicly announced that Trumbo was the screenwriter of Spartacus, and President John F. Kennedy crossed American Legion picket lines to view the film, helping to end blacklisting; Howard Fasts book had also been blacklisted and he had to self-publish the original edition.\nThe film won four Academy Awards Best Supporting Actor for Ustinov, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design, and became the biggest moneymaker in Universal Studios history, until it was surpassed by Airport 1970.In 2017, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."

Both agree that there are seven gates in a wooded area of Hellam Township, Pennsylvania, and that anyone who passes through all seven goes straight to Hell. The location in question never housed an institution; the aforementioned doctor only constructed one gate, to keep out trespassers. Despite the popularity of this as a tourist destination, the property is privately held; visitors may be charged with trespassing as a result. \n\n"
