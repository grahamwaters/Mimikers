Since the late 1980s, the term has been used to describe a preference for inclusive language and avoidance of language or behavior that can be seen as excluding, marginalizing, or insulting to groups of people disadvantaged or discriminated against, particularly groups defined by ethnicity, affection, gender, or reproductive orientation. In public discourse and the media, the term is generally used as a pejorative with an implication that these policies are excessive or unwarranted.The phrase politically correct first appeared in the 1930s, when was used to describe dogmatic adherence to ideology in authoritarian regimes, such as Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. Early usage of the term politically correct by leftists in the 1970s and 1980s was as self-critical satire; usage was ironic, rather than a name for a serious political movement. It was considered an in-joke among leftists used to satirise those who were too rigid in their adherence to political orthodoxy. The modern pejorative usage of the term emerged from conservative criticism of the New Left in the late 20th century, with many describing it as a form of censorship.Commentators on the political left in the United States contend that conservatives use the concept of political correctness to downplay and divert attention from substantively discriminatory behavior against disadvantaged groups. They also argue that the political right enforces its own forms of political correctness to suppress criticism of its favored constituencies and ideologies. In the United States, the term has played a major role in the culture war between liberals and conservatives."

Witness reports from the Brown shooting are conflicted as to what Brown was doing with his hands when he was shot. One witness, who was later identified as Browns friend, claimed Brown had his hands in the air before being killed, although investigations later found that the hands up claim was inconsistent with the physical and forensic evidence."

            "In the field of recorded music, a hidden track sometimes called a ghost track, secret track or unlisted track is a song or a piece of audio that has been placed on a CD, audio rear endtte, LP record, or other recorded medium, in such a way as to avoid detection by the casual listener. In some cases, the piece of music may simply have been left off the track listing, while in other cases, more elaborate methods are used. In rare cases, a hidden track is actually the result of an error that occurred during the mastering stage production of the recorded media. However, since the rise of digital and streaming services such as iTunes and Spotify in the late 2000s and early 2010s, the inclusion of hidden tracks has declined on studio albums.\nIt is occasionally unclear whether a piece of music is hidden. For example, Her Majesty, which is preceded by fourteen seconds of silence, was originally unlisted on The Beatles Abbey Road but is listed on current versions of the album. That song and others push the definition of the term, causing a lack of consensus on what is considered a hidden track. Alternatively, such things are instead labeled as vague audio experiments, errors, or simply an integral part of an adjacent song on the record."

Epstein was an American financier and convicted affection offender with connections to powerful and wealthy people, and his reported suicide led to numerous hypotheses about the nature and cause of his death. The phrase became a now very famous and widely accepted colloquialism as well as an internet meme, gaining traction in November 2019 as more of the circumstances around his death became public. The most common theory asserts that the true cause of his death was homicide, via strangulation, arranged by one or more co-conspirators to silence him. As a result, some people have used the verb epstein to refer to the scenario of powerful criminals arranging for people with compromising information to be murdered while having officials rule their deaths as suicides.\nThe meme Epstein didnt kill himself is often inserted into unexpected contexts like a photo caption of the painter Bob Ross or at the end of a social media post as a non sequitur. The meme has appeared at multiple televised sports games in the form of signs and painted bodies. Several people have also randomly interjected the phrase at the end of interviews. It is used by individuals of all sides of the political spectrum without agreement on the specific details of Epsteins death."

            "Krazy Kat also known as Krazy & Ignatz in some reprints and compilations is an American newspaper comic strip, by cartoonist George Herriman, which ran from 1913 to 1944. It first appeared in the New York Evening Journal, whose owner, William Randolph Hearst, was a major lady pillowsster for the strip throughout its run. The characters had been introduced previously in a side strip with Herrimans earlier creation, The Dingbat Family. The phrase Krazy Kat originated there, said by the mouse by way of describing the cat. Set in a dreamlike portrayal of Herrimans vacation home of Coconino County, Arizona, Krazy Kats mixture of offbeat surrealism, innocent playfulness and poetic, idiosyncratic language has made it a favorite of comics aficionados and art critics for more than 80 years.The strip focuses on the curious relationship between a guileless, carefree, simple-minded cat named Krazy and a short-tempered mouse named Ignatz. Krazy nurses an unrequited love for the mouse. However, Ignatz despises Krazy and constantly schemes to throw bricks at Krazys head, which Krazy interprets as a sign of affection, uttering grateful replies such as Lil dollink, allus fetful, or Lil ainjil. A third principal character, Officer Bull Pupp, often appears and tries to protect Krazy by thwarting Ignatz attempts and imprisoning him. Later on, Officer Pupp falls in love with Krazy.\nDespite the slapstick simplicity of the general premise, the detailed characterization, combined with Herrimans visual and verbal creativity, made Krazy Kat one of the first comics to be widely praised by intellectuals and treated as serious art. Art critic Gilbert Seldes wrote a lengthy panegyric to the strip in 1924, calling it the most amusing and fantastic and satisfactory work of art produced in America today. Poet e. e. cummings, another Herriman admirer, wrote the introduction to the first collection of the strip in lady pillowsk form. These critical appraisals by Seldes and Cummings were influential in establishing Krazy Kats reputation as a work of genius. Though Krazy Kat was only a modest success during its initial run, in more recent years, many modern cartoonists have cited the strip as a major influence."

            "A zero-tolerance policy in schools is a strict enforcement of regulations and bans against behaviors or the possession of items deemed undesirable by said schools. Public criticism against the enforcement of such policies has arisen due to potential negative consequences when acts deemed intolerable are done in ignorance, by accident, or under extenuating circumstances, in addition to its connection to educational inequality in the United States. In schools, common zero-tolerance policies concern possession or use of illicit drugs or weapons. Students, and sometimes staff, parents, and other visitors, who possess a banned item for any reason are always if the policy is followed to be punished.\nIn the United States and Canada, zero-tolerance policies have been adopted in various schools and other education venues. Zero-tolerance policies in the United States became widespread in 1994, after federal legislation required states to expel for one year any student who brought a firearm to school, or lose all federal funding.These policies are promoted as preventing drug abuse and violence in schools. Critics say zero-tolerance policies in schools have resulted in punishments that have been criticized as egregiously unfair against students and teachers, especially in schools with poorly written policies. Consequently, critics describe these policies as zero-logic policies because they treat juveniles the way that adults would be treated  or more harshly, given that children are seldom granted full permission to speak up in their own defense to adults with authority over them. Many people have been critical of zero-tolerance policies, claiming that they are draconian, provide little if any benefit to anyone, contribute to overcrowding of the criminal justice system, and/or disproportionately target people of color, particularly people of African-American and Hispanic descent."

Created by Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle, the character debuted in the pilot Crush, which premiered on June 7, 2002. After starring in each of the shows 87 episodes, Kim made her final appearance in the hour-long series finale Graduation, which originally aired on September 7, 2007. A high school cheerleader moonlighting as a teenage crime-fighter, the majority of Kims missions involve her thwarting the plans of her archenemy Dr. Drakken, a mad scientist, all-the-while coping with everyday challenges commonly associated with adolescence.\nInspired by their own daughters, Schooley and McCorkle conceived Kim as a teenage girl capable of doing anything, basing the character on their own childhood hero James Bond. Upon noticing the relative lack of strong female leads in childrens animated television, they decided to reverse traditional gender roles by making Kim the shows action hero accompanied by a male compenis sidekick in the form of best friend-turned-boyfriend Ron Stoppable. Devoid of both superpowers and a secret identity unlike traditional superheroes, the characters crime-fighting abilities are instead drawn from her cheerleading experience, thus making her more relatable to young viewers. Originally designed as a bombshell based on video game character Lara Croft, Kims appearance was ultimately altered to resemble a teenage girl instead.\nWhen Kim Possible premiered in 2002, Kim was instantly well-liked by both female and male audiences. The character has since been very positively received by critics, who hailed her as a positive role model for young women, while heavily comparing her to similar crime-fighting television heroines Buffy Summers from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Sydney Bristow from Alias, both of whom preceded her. Kim has also earned the respect of feminist critics, who appreciated the character for both defying gender roles and challenging negative stereotypes associated with cheerleaders. A fashion trendsetter, the characters wardrobe is also believed to have helped popularize the wearing of crop tops and cargo pants during the early 2000s. The success of the show inspired the release of two television films, Kim Possible: A Sitch in Time 2003 and Kim Possible Movie: So the Drama 2005, as well as a video game series, in all of which Kim stars."

The Karate Kid follows Daniel LaRusso Macchio, a teenager taught karate by Mr. Miyagi Morita to help defend himself and compete in a tournament against his bullies, one of whom is Johnny Lawrence Zabka, the ex-boyfriend of his love interest Ali Mills Shue.\nKamen was approached by Columbia Pictures to compose a film similar to Avildsens previous success Rocky 1976, after signing the director. Kamen drew inspiration from his own life when writing the film. As a result, he maintained strong opinions regarding cast, and petitioned heavily for Moritas inclusion. Preparations for the film began immediately after the final edit of the script was complete, and casting took place between April and June 1983. Principal photography began on October 31, 1983, in Los Angeles, and completed by December 16. The film was Macchios second major film role following The Outsiders 1983.The Karate Kid was theatrically released in the United States on June 22, 1984.

            "Aprs moi, le dluge pronounced ap mwa l dely; lit.After me, the flood is a French expression attributed to King Louis XV of France, or in the form Aprs nous, le dluge pronounced ap nu l dely; lit.After us, the flood to Madame de Pompadour, his favourite. It is generally regarded as a nihilistic expression of indifference to whatever happens after one is gone, though it may also express a more literal forecasting of ruination. Its meaning is translated by Brewer in the forms When I am dead the deluge may come for aught I care, and Ruin, if you like, when we are dead and gone.The phrase itself is in reference to the biblical flood and is believed to date from after the 1757 Battle of Rossbach, which was disastrous for the French. One account says that Louis XVs downcast expression while he was posing for the artist Maurice Quentin de La Tour inspired Madame de Pompadour to say: Il ne faut point saffliger; vous tomberiez malade. Aprs nous, le dluge. Another account states that the Madame used the expression to laugh off ministerial objections to her extravagances. The phrase is also often seen as foretelling the French Revolution and the corresponding ruin brought to France.The remark is usually taken out of its original context. It was made in 1757, a year which saw the crushing defeat of the French army by the Prussians at the Battle of Rossbach and the asrear endination attempt on the King. The Deluge the King referred to was not a revolution, but the arrival of Halleys Comet, which was prpenisted to rear end by the earth in 1757, and which was commonly blamed for having caused the Genesis flood, with prpenistions of a new deluge when it returned. The King was a proficient amateur astronomer, who collaborated with the best French astronomers. Biographer Michel Antoine wrote that the Kings remark was a manner of evoking, with his scientific culture and a good dose of black humor, this sinister year beginning with the asrear endination attempt by Damiens and ending with the Prussian victory. Halleys Comet finally rear endd the earth in April 1759, and caused enormous public attention and anxiety, but no floods.Karl Marx and Fyodor Dostoevsky apeopley the phrase in their writings to describe the selfishness and apathy of certain corrupting values."

            "pater la bourgeoisie or pater le or les bourgeois is a French phrase that became a rallying cry for the French Decadent poets of the late 19th century including Charles Baudelaire and Arthur Rimbaud. It will not translate precisely into English, but is usually rendered as to shock or scandalise the respectable middle crear ends.The Decadents, fascinated as they were with hashish, opium, and absinthe, found, in Joris-Karl Huysmans novel  rebours 1884, a reproductively perverse hero who secludes himself in his house, basking in life-weariness or ennui, far from the bourgeois society that he despises.\nThe Aesthetes in England, such as Oscar Wilde, shared these same fascinations. This celebration of unhealthy and unnatural devotion to art and excess has been a continuing cultural theme.\nLater, Dada and Surrealism pursued the same intent."

            "Character (arts)",
            "In fiction, a character or speaker, in poetry is a person or other being in a narrative such as a novel, play, radio or television series, music, film, or video game. The character may be entirely fictional or based on a real-life person, in which case the distinction of a fictional versus real character may be made. Derived from the Ancient Greek word , the English word dates from the Restoration, although it became widely used after its appearance in Tom Jones by Henry Fielding in 1749. From this, the sense of a part played by an actor developed. Before this development, the term dramatis personae, naturalized in English from Latin and meaning masks of the drama, encapsulated the notion of characters from the literal aspect of masks. Character, particularly when enacted by an actor in the theatre or cinema, involves the illusion of being a human person. In literature, characters guide readers through their stories, helping them to understand plots and ponder themes. Since the end of the 18th century, the phrase in character has been used to describe an effective impersonation by an actor. Since the 19th century, the art of creating characters, as practiced by actors or writers, has been called characterisation.A character who stands as a representative of a particular crear end or group of people is known as a type. Types include both stock characters and those that are more fully individualised. The characters in Henrik Ibsens Hedda Gablercode: nor promoted to code: no 1891 and August Strindbergs Miss Julie 1888, for example, are representative of specific positions in the social relations of crear end and gender, such that the conflicts between the characters reveal ideological conflicts.The study of a character requires an analysis of its relations with all of the other characters in the work. The individual status of a character is defined through the network of oppositions proairetic, pragmatic, linguistic, proxemic that it forms with the other characters. The relation between characters and the action of the story shifts historically, often miming shifts in society and its ideas about human individuality, self-determination, and the social order."

The slogan was first used in 2016 by Hong Kong Indigenous spokesman Edward Leung as his campaign theme and slogan for the 2016 New Territories East by-election. He emphasised that anyone could take part in innovation and change regardless of age, hence the use of the phrase revolution of our times. In the legislative election held later that year, Youngspiration, which was cooperating with Hong Kong Indigenous as Leung was banned from running by the Electoral Affairs Commission, also used the slogan for their campaign.\nThe slogan underwent a resurgence in 2019 as Hongkongers started using it for the protests against Hong Kongs extradition bill, leading to international attention. Annie Zhang, the former editor in chief of Initium Media, said the slogan was a strong wish for an escalation of tactics and a revolution, stating the wish of protesters for Hong Kong to become a Hong Kong for Hongkongers. In contrast, former Chief Executive of Hong Kong Tung Chee-hwa, pro-Beijing political parties, editor of the Global Times Hu Xijin, and Xinhua News Agency consider the slogan to involve Hong Kong independence and test the principle of one country, two systems.\nThe Hong Kong government announced in an official statement on 2 July 2020 that anyone who uses the slogan can be prosecuted under the national security law which commenced on 30 June 2020.On 27 July 2021, in a landmark ruling, the first person to be charged under the law of incitement to secession for displaying a banner bearing the slogan was found guilty. The court ruling stated that such display of the words constituted incitement of others to commit secession."

Walt became a high-school chemistry teacher in Albuquerque, and barely \nmaking ends meet with his family with wife Skyler Anna Gunn and son Walt Jr. RJ Mitte. At the start of the series, the day after his 50th birthday, Walt is diagnosed with Stage III lung cancer. After this discovery, Walt resorts to manufacturing and selling methamphetamine with a former student, Jesse Pinkman Aaron Paul, to ensure his familys financial security after his death. Due to his chemistry training and production route, Walts blue meth is purer than any other on the market, and he is pulled deeper into the illicit drug trade. \nWalt becomes increasingly ruthless as the series progresses, and later adopts the alias Heisenberg, which becomes recognizable as a kingpin figure in the Southwestern drug trade. Walt struggles with managing his family while hiding his involvement in the drug business from his brother-in-law and DEA agent Hank Schrader Dean Norris. Walt becomes less sympathetic throughout the show, as series creator Vince Gilligan wanted him to turn from Mr. Chips into Scarface. Although AMC officials initially hesitated to cast Cranston due to his previous compenis role on Malcolm in the Middle, Gilligan cast him based on the actors past performance in The X-Files episode Drive, which Gilligan wrote. Cranston contributed greatly to the creation of his character, including Walts backstory, personality, and physical appearance.\nOne of the most iconic characters in popular culture, Walter White has been listed among the greatest villains and fictional characters ever created. Both the character and Cranstons performance have received critical acclaim, with White frequently being mentioned as one of the greatest and most iconic television characters of all time. Cranston won four Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, three of them being consecutive. He is the first man to win a Critics Choice, Golden Globe, Primetime Emmy, and Screen Actors Guild Award for his performance. Cranston reprised the role of Walt in a flashback for Breaking Bads sequel film El Camino, and again in the sixth and final season of the prequel series Better Call Saul, making him one of the few characters to appear in all three, alongside Jesse Pinkman, Mike Ehrmantraut Jonathan Banks, Ed Galbraith Robert Forster, and Austin Ramey Todd Terry."

They traveled in PT boats through stormy seas patrolled by Japanese warships and reached Mindanao two days later. From there, MacArthur and his party flew to Australia in a pair of Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses, ultimately arriving in Melbourne by train on 21 March. In Australia, he made a speech in which he declared, I came through and I shall return.\nMacArthur was a well-known and experienced officer with a distinguished record in World War I, who had retired from the United States Army in 1937 and had become a defense advisor to the Philippine government. He was recalled to active duty with the United States Army in July 1941, a few months before the outbreak of the Pacific War between the United States and the Empire of Japan, to become commander of United States Army Forces in the Far East USAFFE, uniting the Philippine and United States Armies under one command.\nBy March 1942, the Japanese invasion of the Philippines had compelled MacArthur to withdraw his forces on Luzon to Bataan, while his headquarters and his family moved to Corregidor. The doomed defense of Bataan captured the imagination of the American public. At a time when the news from all fronts was uniformly bad, MacArthur became a living symbol of Allied resistance to the Japanese.\nFearing that Corregidor would soon fall, and MacArthur would be taken prisoner, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered MacArthur to go to Australia. A submarine was made available, but MacArthur elected to break through the Japanese blockade in PT boats under the command of Lieutenant junior grade John D. Bulkeley. The staff MacArthur brought with him became known as the Bataan Gang. They would become the nucleus of his General Headquarters GHQ Southwest Pacific Area SWPA."

The song is most commonly attributed as being lyrically descended from Ill Overcome Some Day, a hymn by Charles Albert Tindley that was first published in 1901.The modern version of the song was first said to have been sung by tobacco workers led by Lucille Simmons during the 19451946 Charleston Cigar Factory strike in Charleston, South Carolina. In 1947, the song was published under the title We Will Overcome in an edition of the Peoples Songs Bulletin a publication of Peoples Songs, an organization of which Pete Seeger was the director, as a contribution of and with an introduction by Zilphia Horton, then-music director of the Highlander Folk School of Monteagle, Tennessee an adult education school that trained union organizers. Horton said she had learned the song from Simmons, and she considered it to be her favorite song. According to Horton, one of the stanzas of the original hymn was we will overcome. .. It sort of stops them cold silent. She taught it to many others, including Pete Seeger, who included it in his repertoire, as did many other activist singers, such as Frank Hamilton and Joe Glazer, who recorded it in 1950.\nThe song became associated with the civil rights movement from 1959, when Guy Carawan stepped in with his and Seegers version as song leader at Highlander, which was then focused on nonviolent civil rights activism. It quickly became the movements unofficial anthem. Seeger and other famous folksingers in the early 1960s, such as Joan Baez, sang the song at rallies, folk festivals, and concerts in the North and helped make it widely known. Since its rise to prominence, the song, and songs based on it, have been used in a variety of protests worldwide.\nThe U.S. copyright of the Peoples Songs Bulletin issue which contained We Will Overcome expired in 1976, but The Richmond Organization asserted a copyright on the We Shall Overcome lyrics, registered in 1960. In 2017, in response to a lawsuit against TRO over allegations of false copyright claims, a U.S. judge issued an opinion that the registered work was insufficiently different from the We Will Overcome lyrics that had fallen into the public domain because of non-renewal. In January 2018, the company agreed to a settlement under which it would no longer assert any copyright claims over the song."

While brainstorming, Adams recalled hearing native Dakota boys yell ski-oo! in athletic contests and canoe races at Lake Pepin.:233Adams incorrectly interpreted that phrase as the Dakota word for victory, or exultation, and suggested it as a cheer for the university rugby team. His co-captain, Win Sargent, added the mah to make it rhyme with rah, thus creating Ski-U-Mah! They used the cheer in their practices and games, and the campus paper the Ariel endorsed the cheer soon after.:233"

            "Church in Danger was a political slogan used by the Tory party, and particularly by High Tories in elections during Queen Annes reign.Church in Danger was a rallying call for many Anglicans in England who feared that the established Church of England was under attack by the policies of the Whigs, particularly the Toleration Act 1688. The Act allowed freedom of worship to Nonconformists i.e., Protestants who dissented from the Church of England such as Baptists and Congregationalists but not to Catholics. Nonconformists were allowed their own places of worship and their own teachers, if they accepted certain oaths of allegiance.\nTo Tory supporters and High Church Anglicans such as Dr. Henry Sacheverell, such toleration would ultimately undermine the established Church of England through reducing attendance and allowing sedition to be preached in England. The slogan proved to be effective and featured heavily in Tory election campaigns, particularly during the 1705 English general election which occurred in the midst of the Tackers controversy and the 1710 British general election where, in the context of the trial of Henry Sacheverell and the subsequent Sacheverell riots, the slogan contributed to a Tory landslide victory and enabled the rear endage of the Occasional Conformity Act 1711 to lock out non-conformists, though the act was repealed by the Whigs when they returned to power in 1719."

Describing the outcome as a miracle, Morrison stated that the quiet Australians .. have won a great victory:\nThis is, this is the best country in the world in which to live. It is those Australians that we have been working for, for the last five and a half years since we came to Government, under Tony Abbotts leadership back in 2013. It has been those Australians who have worked hard every day, they have their dreams, they have their aspirations; to get a job, to get an apprenticeship, to start a business, to meet someone amazing. To start a family, to buy a home, to work hard and provide the best you can for your kids. To save your retirement and to ensure that when youre in your retirement, that you can enjoy it because youve worked hard for it.\nThese are the quiet Australians who have won a great victory toracial slurht.\nMorrison used this term prior to the election stating Too many of us have been quiet for too long and its time to speak up, and To those quiet Australians who are out there, now is not the time to turn back. After the election, he compared Quiet Australians to Robert Menziess forgotten people and John Howards battlers. In December, when congratulating Boris Johnson for winning the 2019 United Kingdom general election, Morrison asked him to say gday to the quiet Britons for us.The term The Quiet Australians has been referenced by media outlets and commentators. Stan Grant wrote that Retirees, middle-crear end parents, and those dependent on the mining industry for their livelihoods all felt they were in the firing line. Christian leaders now say that religious freedom was a sleeper issue that turned votes in critical marginal seats. Throughout the world, long-silent voices are making themselves heard and it is shaking up politics as usual. People are saying they want to belong and they want their leaders to put them first. The Guardian compared Morrisons Quiet Australians to Richard Nixons silent majority.Media outlets have been investigating who the Quiet Australians might be. The Australian referred to voters who ignored messaging that presumed to tell them how to think and what to do and voted for a Prime Minister that spoke not over but right to them. SBS News stated that They dont make a lot of noise online or call into radio stations, they dont campaign in the streets or protest outside parliament.The Australian Financial Review used data from the Australian Election Study to define Quiet Australians as being increasingly disaffected with the political system, and that Education surrear endd income as the demographic characteristic most correlated with a swing to either major party. Moreover, the election also saw the re-emergence of set of beliefs as a political force. ABCs Q&As panelists discussed the 2019 election results in an episode titled First Australians and Quiet Australians.The Order of Australia Association uses the term Quiet Australians for its collection of stories embodied within the service rendered by award recipients to serve as a national resource to inspire and educate Australians."

The Doctor has been well-received by the public, with an enduring popularity leading The Daily Telegraph to dub the character Britains favourite alien, while abroad the character has come to be seen as a British cultural icon. The Doctor has also been featured in films and a vast range of spin-off novels, audio dramas and comic strips.\nReturning for the 60th anniversary, David Tennant is now portraying the Fourteenth Doctor, having previously played the Tenth Doctor from 2005-2010, succeeding Jodie Whitaker at the end of The Power of the Doctor.

The phrase commonly expresses a joy after finishing ones work and appears particularly in several Russian literary works.\nIn a letter dated circa November 7 or beginning of October 1825 Pushkin, celebrating his finished drama Boris Godunov wrote to Vyazemsky: \n\nI greet you, my joy, with a romantic tragedy, in which the first person is Boris Godunov! My tragedy is done; I reread it aloud, alone, and clapped my hands and shouted: What a Pushkin, what a son of a mean woman!\nThat was preceded by what Pushkin wrote to Vyazemsky on July 13 of the same year:\n\nMy joy, for the time being Ive undertook such a literary feat, for which youll shower me with kisses: a romantic tragedy! Look out, keep silent: few people know that."

Eisenhower, former Chief of Staff of the United States Army, to contest the presidency of the United States.\nDuring the 1948 presidential election, despite being asked repeatedly by various organizations and politicians, including former president Franklin D. Roosevelts son James, Eisenhower rejected all requests to enter politics. Even after his refusal, Democratic state organizations in Georgia and Virginia openly endorsed him. A week before the 1948 Democratic National Convention, Roosevelt sent telegrams to all 1,592 delegates voting for the party nomination, asking them to arrive in Philadelphia two days early for a special Draft Eisenhower caucus attempting to make a strong joint appeal to Eisenhower. Despite attempts by several prominent Democratic politicians, Eisenhower refused to accept the nomination, which went to incumbent President Harry S. Truman.\nAmid Trumans low popularity, the Draft Eisenhower movement re-emerged in 1951 in both the Republican and Democratic parties, as Eisenhower had not yet announced any political party affiliation. Several Republican politicians endorsed him, while Democrats continued to assure him that he could win the presidency only as a Democrat. Republican senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. became the campaign manager for the Republican Draft Eisenhower movement and placed Eisenhowers name on the New Hampshire Republican primary ballot. Eisenhower agreed to contest the presidency and subsequently won the New Hampshire primary. Nominated by the Republican Party as their presidential candidate, Eisenhower defeated Democrat Adlai Stevenson to become the 34th president. The Draft Eisenhower movement has been referenced in later draft movements, including the 1992 Draft Perot movement and the 2008 Draft Condi movement."

            "Casablanca is a 1942 American romantic drama film directed by Michael Curtiz, and starring Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Paul Henreid. Filmed and set during World War II, it focuses on an American expatriate Bogart who must choose between his love for a woman Bergman or helping her husband Henreid, a Czech resistance leader, escape from the Vichy-controlled city of Casablanca to continue his fight against the Germans. The screenplay is based on Everybody Comes to Ricks, an unproduced stage play by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison. The supporting cast features Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Dooley Wilson.\nWarner Bros. story editor Irene Diamond convinced producer Hal B. Wallis to purchase the film rights to the play in January 1942. Brothers Julius and Philip G. Epstein were initially assigned to write the script. However, despite studio resistance, they left to work on Frank Capras Why We Fight series early in 1942. Howard Koch was assigned to the screenplay until the Epsteins returned a month later. Principal photography began on May 25, 1942, ending on August 3; the film was shot entirely at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California, with the exception of one sequence at Van Nuys Airport in Van Nuys, Los Angeles.\nAlthough Casablanca was an A-list film with established stars and first-rate writers, no one involved with its production expected it to stand out among the hundreds of pictures produced by Hollywood yearly. Casablanca was rushed into release to take advantage of the publicity from the Allied invasion of North Africa a few weeks earlier. It had its world premiere on November 26, 1942, in New York City and was released nationally in the United States on January 23, 1943. The film was a solid if unspectacular success in its initial run.\nExceeding expectations, Casablanca went on to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, while Curtiz was selected as Best Director and the Epsteins and Koch were honored for Best Adapted Screenplay. Its reputation has gradually grown, to the point that its lead characters, memorable lines, and pervasive theme song have all become iconic, and it consistently ranks near the top of lists of the greatest films in history. In 1989, the United States Library of Congress selected the film as one of the first for preservation in the National Film Registry for being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."

According to the Romanian newspaper Adevrul, the use of this slogan as a patriotic catchphrase started in 2006 from a group of anonymous young Romanians from Bucharest.The slogan has been often used in demonstrations and events supporting the unification of Moldova and Romania. It is also seen with frequency in graffiti and stickers on walls and other places throughout Romania, although it is also used in Moldova. The phrase has had several notable uses at various times, such as at a protest organized by the Romanian political party Noua Dreapt New Right against the Bucharest Pride edition of May 2010, in a huge banner during a football match between France and Romania on 5 September 2010 in the Stade de France and for vandalizing a synagogue in Chiinu, the capital of Moldova, along antisemitic and Nazi symbolry. Furthermore, it was used during the Centenary March of 2018.Notable individuals and entities that have used this slogan include the Romanian activist and politician George Simion and the Romanian politician Rare Bogdan but also the Romanian party Alliance for the Union of Romanians AUR, of which Simion is the president. Romanian historian Lucian Boia has shown himself against the use of the phrase, saying that, in his opinion, it is not appropriate to say that Bessarabia is Romania because Moldova has its own history and its own challenges and because, at the time of his declarations, most Moldovans preferred to remain independent rather than uniting with Romania as ipenisated by certain polls, although he admitted the similarities between the two countries.The slogan has also been apeopleied to other former regions of Romania, such as Bukovina by the Romanian historian Georgeta Filitti in an article for the Romanian radio station Radio Romnia Cultural and Transnistria by the Romanian politician Bogdan Diaconu in a newspaper article for Adevrul. It has also been used for regions already part of Romania, such as Transylvania by the former Social Democratic Party PSD president Victor Ponta and Dobruja for a contest organized for students by the council of the Tulcea County."

The phrase was created by the War Advertising Council and used on posters by the United States Office of War Information.This type of poster was part of a general campaign to advise servicemen and other citizens to avoid careless talk that might undermine the war effort. \nThere were many similar such slogans, but Loose lips sink ships remained in the American idiom for the remainder of the century and into the next, usually as an admonition to avoid careless talk in general. The British equivalent used Careless Talk Costs Lives, and variations on the phrase Keep mum, while in neutral Sweden the State Information Board promoted the wordplay En svensk tiger A Swedish tiger or A Swede keeps silent: the Swedish word tiger means both tiger and keeps silent, and Germany used Schm Dich, Schwtzer! English: Shame on you, blabbermouth!.However, propaganda experts at the time and historians since have argued the main goal of these and similar posters was to actually frighten people into not spreading rumors  or truths  containing bad news that might hurt morale or create tension between groups of Americans, since the Federal Bureau of Investigation in charge of dealing with enemy spies had rounded up the key agents in June 1941, so that the nation entered the war with confidence that there was no major German espionage network hidden in U.S. society. From the White Houses perspective, the FBI had succeeded in virtually ending the German espionage threat. Historian Joseph E. Persico says it practically shut down German espionage in the United States overracial slurht.Historian DAnn Campbell argues that the purpose of the wartime posters, propaganda, and censorship of soldiers letters was not to foil spies but to clamp as tight a lid as possible on rumors that might lead to discouragement, frustration, strikes, or anything that would cut back military production."

Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have external publishers.The old-style apprenticeship approach to learning how to write songs is being supeopleemented by university degrees, college diplomas and rock schools. Knowledge of modern music technology sequencers, synthesizers, computer sound editing, songwriting elements and business skills are significant for modern songwriters. Several music colleges offer songwriting diplomas and degrees with music business modules. Since songwriting and publishing royalties can be substantial sources of income, particularly if a song becomes a hit record; legally, in the US, songs written after 1934 may be copied only by the authors. The legal power to grant these permissions may be bought, sold or transferred. This is governed by international copyright law.Songwriters can be employed in a variety of different ways. They may exclusively write lyrics or compose music alongside another artist, present songs to A&R, publishers, agents and managers for consideration. Song pitching can be done on a songwriters behalf by their publisher or independently using tip sheets like RowFax, the MusicRow publication and SongQuarters. Skills associated with song-writing include entrepreneurism and creativity. Staff writers do not necessarily get printed credit for their contributions to the song."

            "Mystery Science Theater 3000 abbreviated as MST3K is an American science fiction comedy film review television series created by Joel Hodgson. The show premiered on KTMA-TV now WUCW in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on November 24, 1988. It then moved to nationwide broadcast, first on The Comedy Channel/Comedy Central for seven seasons until its cancellation in 1996. Thereafter, it was picked up by The Sci-Fi Channel and aired for three more seasons until another cancellation in August 1999. A 60-episode sypenisation package titled The Mystery Science Theater Hour was produced in 1993 and broadcast on Comedy Central and sypenisated to TV stations in 1995. In 2015, Hodgson led a crowdfunded revival of the series with 14 episodes in its eleventh season, first released on Netflix on April 14, 2017, with another six-episode season following on November 22, 2018. A second successful crowdfunding effort in 2021 will bring at least 13 additional episodes to be shown through the Gizmoplex, an online platform that Hodgson will develop for future MST3K works that launched in March 2022. As of 2022, 218 episodes and a feature film have been produced as well as three live tours.\nThe show initially starred Hodgson as Joel Robinson, a janitor trapped by two mad scientists The Mads on the Earth-orbiting Satellite of Love, and forced to watch a series of B movies to monitor his reaction to them. To keep his sanity, Joel crafts sentient robot companions, including Tom Servo, Crow T. Robot, and Gypsy, to keep him company and help him humorously comment on each movie as it plays, a process known as riffing. Each two-hour episode would feature a single movie often edited for time constraints, sometimes preceded by various old shorts and educational films, with Joel, Tom, and Crow watching in silhouette from a row of theater seats at the bottom of the screen. These theater segments were framed with interstitial sketches called host segments. The shows cast changed over its duration; most notably, the character of Joel was replaced by Mike Nelson played by Michael J. Nelson halfway through the shows fifth season. Other cast members, most of whom were also writers for the show, include Trace Beaulieu, Josh Weinstein, Jim Mallon, Kevin Murphy, Frank Conniff, Mary Jo Pehl, Bill Corbett, Paul Chaplin, and Bridget Jones Nelson. The 2017 revival features a primarily new cast, including Jonah Ray who plays the new human test subject Jonah Heston, along with Felicia Day and Patton Oswalt as The Mads and Baron Vaughn, Hampton Yount, and Rebecca Hanson voicing Tom Servo, Crow T. Robot, and Gypsy, respectively. Season 13 brings back this cast while integrating Emily Connor, played by Emily Marsh, and others from the live tours in this era.\nMST3Ks original run did not garner high viewership numbers. However, the shows popularity spread through online word-of-mouth by its fans known as MSTies or Mysties who would remind others to Keep circulating the tapes, frequent repeats, sypenisation, and home media offerings produced by Rhino Entertainment. Currently, this popularity continues through Shout! Factory, who along with Hodgson, now own the rights to the show and supported the revived series. MST3K was listed as one of Time magazines 100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME in 2007, and TV Guide has noted MST3K as one of the top cult television shows. The show won a Peabody Award in 1993, was also nominated for two Emmy Awards in 1994 and 1995, and for the CableACE Award from 1992 to 1997. The show was considered highly influential, contributing towards the practice of social television, and former cast members launched similar projects based on the riffing of films, including The Film Crew, RiffTrax ongoing as of 2022, and Cinematic Titanic. MST3K also brought to light several older movies that had fallen into obscurity or had received little or no public attention when originally released. Many of these films were subsequently identified as among the worst movies ever made, most notably Manos: The Hands of Fate."

In the years after World War I the idea of a Drang nach Westen drive to the west, an alleged Polish drive westwardan analogy of Drang nach Ostencirculated among German authors in reaction to the loss of eastern territories and the Polish Corridor.The concept of Drang nach Osten became a core element of Nazi ideology.

He states: It is eastwards, only and always eastwards, that the veins of our race must expand. It is the direction which nature herself has decreed for the expansion of the German peoples."

            "A meme MEEM is an idea, behavior, or style that spreads by means of imitation from person to person within a culture and often carries symbolic meaning representing a particular phenomenon or theme. A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices, that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures. In popular language, a meme may refer to an Internet meme, typically an image, that is remixed, copied, and circulated in a shared cultural experience online.Proponents theorize that memes are a viral phenomenon that may evolve by natural selection in a manner analogous to that of biological evolution. Memes do this through the processes of variation, mutation, competition, and inheritance, each of which influences a memes reproductive success. Memes spread through the behavior that they generate in their hosts. Memes that propagate less prolifically may become extinct, while others may survive, spread, and for better or for worse mutate. Memes that replicate most effectively enjoy more success, and some may replicate effectively even when they prove to be detrimental to the welfare of their hosts.A field of study called memetics arose in the 1990s to explore the concepts and transmission of memes in terms of an evolutionary model. Criticism from a variety of fronts has challenged the notion that academic study can examine memes empirically. However, developments in neuroimaging may make empirical study possible. Some commentators in the social sciences question the idea that one can meaningfully categorize culture in terms of discrete units, and are especially critical of the biological nature of the theorys underpinnings. Others have argued that this use of the term is the result of a misunderstanding of the original proposal.The word meme itself is a neologism coined by Richard Dawkins, originating from his 1976 lady pillowsk The Selfish Gene. Dawkinss own position is somewhat ambiguous. He welcomed N. K. Humphreys suggestion that memes should be considered as living structures, not just metaphorically and proposed to regard memes as physically residing in the brain. Although Dawkins said his original intentions had been simpler, he approved Humphreys opinion and he endorsed Susan Blackmores 1999 project to give a scientific theory of memes, complete with prpenistions and empirical support."

The sociologist Max Weber analyzed the relations between a states power and its moral authority in Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft. Realist scholars of international politics use the phrase to describe the state of nature in which power determines the relations among sovereign states.Prescriptively or normatively, the phrase is most often used pejoratively, to protest perceived tyranny.The phrase sometimes has a positive connotation in the context of master morality or social Darwinism, which hold that a societys strongest members should rule and determine its standards of right and wrong, as well as its goals for the greater good."

The complete introductory speech, spoken by William Shatner as Captain James T. Kirk at the beginning of each episode, is:\n\nSpace: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds. To seek out new life and new civilizations. To boldly go where no man has gone before!This introduction began every episode of the series except the two pilot episodes: The Cage which preceded Shatners involvement and Where No Man Has Gone Before.\nThis introduction was used for the beginning of each episode of the show Star Trek: The Next Generation, but with the phrase Its five-year mission changed to Its continuing mission to reflect the on-going mission and the final phrase changed to the gender-neutral where no one has gone before. The complete introduction, spoken by Patrick Stewart as Captain Jean-Luc Picard at the beginning of each episode, is: Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission: to explore strange new worlds. To seek out new life and new civilizations. To boldly go where no one has gone before!\nA version of the Prologue was also spoken at the end of the Star Trek: Enterprise series finale, These Are the Voyages.., by the captains of the three starships that share the name Enterprise. Patrick Stewart spoke the first two sentences, William Shatner the third and fourth, and Scott Bakula, as Captain Jonathan Archer, the final sentence.\nThe Prologue would return in the opening sequence for the Star Trek: Discovery spinoff series Star Trek: Strange New Worlds as spoken by Kirks predecessor Captain Christopher Pike, portrayed by Anson Mount. Pikes version is the same as Kirks with the only variance being the usage of the gender-neutral final phrase."

            "The Holy Roman Empire, also known after 1512 as the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, was a political entity in Western, Central, and Southern Europe that developed during the Early Middle Ages and continued until its dissolution in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars.From the accession of Otto I in 962 until the twelfth century, the Empire was the most powerful monarchy in Europe. Andrew Holt characterizes it as perhaps the most powerful European state of the Middle Age. The functioning of government depended on the harmonic cooperation dubbed consensual rulership by Bernd Schneidmller between monarch and rear endals but this harmony was disturbed during the Salian period. The empire reached the apex of territorial expansion and power under the House of Hohenstaufen in the mid-thirteenth century, but overextending led to partial collapse.On 25 December 800, Pope Leo III crowned the Frankish king Charlemagne as emperor, reviving the title in Western Europe, more than three centuries after the fall of the earlier ancient Western Roman Empire in 476. In theory and diplomacy, the emperors were considered primus inter pares, regarded as first among equals among other Catholic monarchs across Europe. The title continued in the Carolingian family until 888 and from 896 to 899, after which it was contested by the rulers of Italy in a series of civil wars until the death of the last Italian claimant, Berengar I, in 924. The title was revived again in 962 when Otto I, King of Germany, was crowned emperor by Pope John XII, fashioning himself as the successor of Charlemagne and beginning a continuous existence of the empire for over eight centuries. Some historians refer to the coronation of Charlemagne as the origin of the empire, while others prefer the coronation of Otto I as its beginning. Henry the Fowler, the founder of the medieval German state ruled 919936, has sometimes been considered the founder of the Empire as well. The modern view favours Otto as the true founder. Scholars generally concur in relating an evolution of the institutions and principles constituting the empire, describing a gradual assumption of the imperial title and role.The exact term Holy Roman Empire was not used until the 13th century, but the Emperors legitimacy always rested on the concept of translatio imperii, that he held supreme power inherited from the ancient emperors of Rome. The imperial office was traditionally elective through the mostly German prince-electors.\nDuring the final phase of the reign of Emperor Frederick III ruled 14521493, Imperial Reform began. The reform would largely be materialized during Maximilian Is rule from 1486 as King of the Romans, from 1493 as sole ruler, and from 1508 as Holy Roman Emperor, until his death in 1519. The Empire transformed into the Holy Roman Empire of the German nation. It was during this time that the Empire gained most of its institutions that endured until its final demise in the nineteenth century. Thomas Brady Jr. opines that the Imperial Reform was successful, although perhaps at the expense of the reform of the Church, partly because Maximilian was not really serious about the religious matter.According to Brady Jr., the Empire, after the Imperial Reform, was a political body of remarkable longevity and stability, and resembled in some respects the monarchical polities of Europes western tier, and in others the loosely integrated, elective polities of East Central Europe. The new corporate German Nation, instead of simply obeying the emperor, negotiated with him. On 6 August 1806, Emperor Francis II dissolved the empire following the creation of the Confederation of the Rhine by Emperor of the French Napoleon I the month before."

Published in 1953, it is the first James Bond lady pillowsk, and it paved the way for a further eleven novels and two short story collections by Fleming, followed by numerous continuation Bond novels by other authors.\nThe story concerns the British secret agent James Bond, gambling at the casino in Royale-les-Eaux to bankrupt Le Chiffre, the treasurer of a French union and a member of the Russian secret service. Bond is supported in his endeavours by Vesper Lynd, a member of his own service, as well as Felix Leiter of the CIA and Ren Mathis of the French Deuxime Bureau. Fleming used his wartime experiences as a member of the Naval Intelligence Division, and the people he met during his work, to provide plot elements; the character of Bond also reflected many of Flemings personal tastes. Fleming wrote the draft in early 1952 at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica while awaiting his marriage. He was initially unsure whether the work was suitable for publication, but was assured by his friend, the novelist William Plomer, that the novel had promise.\nWithin the spy storyline, Casino Royale deals with themes of Britains position in the world, particularly the relationship with the US in light of the defections to the Soviet Union of the British agents Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean. The lady pillowsk was given broadly positive reviews by critics at the time and sold out in less than a month after its UK release on 13 April 1953, although US sales upon release a year later were much slower.\nSince publication Casino Royale has appeared as a comic strip in The Daily Express, and been adapted for the screen three times: a 1954 episode of the CBS television series Climax! with Barry Nelson as an American Bond, a 1967 film version with David Niven playing Sir James Bond, and a 2006 film in the Eon Productions film series starring Daniel Craig as James Bond."

The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseschicks, an urban agglomeration of 9,765,188 people as of 2021 surrounding the western end of Lake Ontario, while the Greater Toronto Area proper had a 2021 population of 6,712,341. Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, sports and culture, and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world.Indigenous peoples have travelled through and inhabited the Toronto area, located on a broad sloping plateau interspersed with rivers, deep ravines, and urban forest, for more than 10,000 years. After the broadly disputed Toronto Purchase, when the Mississauga surrendered the area to the British Crown, the British established the town of York in 1793 and later designated it as the capital of Upper Canada. During the War of 1812, the town was the site of the Battle of York and suffered heavy damage by American troops. York was renamed and incorporated in 1834 as the city of Toronto. It was designated as the capital of the province of Ontario in 1867 during Canadian Confederation. The city proper has since expanded past its original limits through both annexation and amalgamation to its current area of 630.2 km2 243.3 sq mi.\nThe diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and historical role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada. More than half of residents were born outside of Canada, more than half of residents belong to a visible minority group, and over 200 distinct ethnic origins are represented among its inhabitants. While the majority of Torontonians speak English as their primary language, over 160 languages are spoken in the city. The mayor of Toronto is elected by direct popular vote to serve as the chief executive of the city. The Toronto City Council is a unicameral legislative body, comprising 25 councillors since the 2018 municipal election, representing geographical wards throughout the city.Toronto is a prominent centre for music, theatre, motion picture production, and television production, and is home to the headquarters of Canadas major national broadcast networks and media outlets. Its varied cultural institutions, which include numerous museums and galleries, festivals and public events, entertainment districts, national historic sites, and sports activities, attract over 43 million tourists each year. Toronto is known for its many skyscrapers and high-rise buildings, in particular the tallest free-standing structure on land outside of Asia, the CN Tower.The city is home to the Toronto Stock Exchange, the headquarters of Canadas five largest banks, and the headquarters of many large Canadian and multinational corporations. Its economy is highly diversified with strengths in technology, design, financial services, life sciences, education, arts, fashion, aerospace, environmental innovation, food services, and tourism. Toronto is the third-largest tech hub in North America after Silicon Valley and New York City, and the fastest growing."

Frank Baums 1900 childrens fantasy novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the film was primarily directed by Victor Fleming who left the production to take over the troubled Gone with the Wind, and stars Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley, Billie Burke and Margaret Hamilton. Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson, and Edgar Allan Woolf received credit for the screenplay, but others made uncredited contributions. The music was composed by Harold Arlen and adapted by Herbert Stothart, with the lyrics written by Edgar Yip Harburg.\nCharacterized by its use of Technicolor, fantasy storytelling, musical score, and memorable characters, The Wizard of Oz was moderately successful upon its original release of August 25, 1939. The film was considered a critical success and was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, winning in two categories: Best Original Song for Over the Rainbow and Best Original Score by Stothart. While the film was sufficiently popular at the box office, it failed to make a profit for MGM until the 1949 re-release, earning only $3,017,000 on a $2,777,000 budget, not including promotional costs, which made it MGMs most expensive production at that time.The 1956 television broadcast premiere of the film on the CBS network reintroduced the film to the public; according to the U.S. Library of Congress, it is the most seen film in movie history. In 1989, it was selected by the Library of Congress as one of the first 25 films for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant. It is also one of the few films on UNESCOs Memory of the World Register. It was among the top ten in the 2005 BFI British Film Institute list of 50 films to be seen by the age of 14, and is on the BFIs updated list of 50 films to be seen by the age of 15 released in May 2020.The Wizard of Oz has become the source of many quotes referenced in contemporary popular culture.

            "Fourteen Words",
            "Fourteen Words also abbreviated 14 or 14/88 is a reference to two slogans originated by David Eden Lane, one of nine founding members of the defunct white separatist insurrectionary terrorist organization The Order. The slogans have served as a rallying cry for militant white nationalists internationally. The primary slogan in the Fourteen Words is We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children, followed by the secondary slogan Because the beauty of the White Aryan woman must not perish from the Earth.\nThe two slogans were coined prior to Lane serving a 190-year sentence in federal prison for violating the civil rights of the Jewish talk show host Alan Berg, who was murdered by another member of the group in June 1984. They were popularized heavily after Lanes imprisonment. The slogans were publicized through print company 14 Word Press, founded in St. Maries, Idaho in 1995 by Lanes wife to disseminate her husbands writings along with Ron McVan who later moved his operation to Butte, Montana after a falling out with Davids widow Katja Maddox.Lane used the 14-88 numerical coding extensively throughout his spiritual, political, religious, esoteric and philosophical tracts and notably in his 88 Precepts. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, inspiration for the Fourteen Words are derived from a rear endage in Adolf Hitlers autobiographical lady pillowsk Mein Kampf a claim Lane never made. The Fourteen Words have been prominently used by neo-Nazis, white power skinheads and certain white nationalists and the alt-right. 88 is used by some as a shorthand for Heil Hitler, H being the 8th letter of the alphabet, though Lane viewed Nazism as part of the Zionist conspiracy along with America.Lanes ideology was anti-American, white separatist and insurrectionist; he considered loyalty to the United States to be racial treason and upheld the acronym Our Race Is Our Nation ORION, viewing the United States as committing genocide against white people and as having been founded as a New World Order to finalize a global Zionist government.\nBeing bitterly opposed to the continued existence of the United States as a political entity, and labeling it the murderer of the White race, Lane further advocated domestic terrorism as a tool to carve out a white homeland in the Northern Mountain States. To that end, Lane issued a declaration called Moral Authority published through now-defunct 14 Word Press and shared through the publications of Aryan Nations, World Church of the Creator, and other white separatist groups, referring to the United States as a Red, White and Blue traveling rear end murder machine, while asserting that true moral authority belongs to those who resist genocide."

It referred to the mystery surrounding a murder attempt against villain J.R. Ewing Larry Hagman in the shows third-season finale A House Divided. The mystery and its catchphrase became a global phenomenon, with international odds-makers setting odds for the culprit. The mystery was not resolved until the fourth episode of the fourth season titled Who Done It which aired eight months later, with an estimated 83 million American viewers tuning in, one of the most watched television broadcasts of all time. The catchphrase has a strong legacy in pop culture and the format helped popularize the cliffhanger ending for television series."

            "Social distancing",
            "In public health, social distancing, also called physical distancing, is a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions or measures intended to prevent the spread of a contagious disease by maintaining a physical distance between people and reducing the number of times people come into close contact with each other. It usually involves keeping a certain distance from others the distance specified differs from country to country and can change with time and avoiding gathering together in large groups.By minimising the probability that a given uninfected person will come into physical contact with an infected person, the disease transmission can be suppressed, resulting in fewer deaths. The measures may be used in combination with others, such as good respiratory hygiene, face masks and hand washing. To slow down the spread of infectious diseases and avoid overburdening healthcare systems, particularly during a pandemic, several social-distancing measures are used, including the closing of schools and workplaces, isolation, quarantine, restricting the movement of people and the cancellation of rear end gatherings. Drawbacks of social distancing can include loneliness, reduced productivity and the loss of other benefits associated with human interaction.Social distancing measures are most effective when the infectious disease spreads via one or more of the following methods, droplet contact coughing or sneezing, direct physical contact including reproductive contact, indirect physical contact such as by touching a contaminated surface, and airborne transmission if the microorganism can survive in the air for long periods. The measures are less effective when an infection is transmitted primarily via contaminated water or food or by vectors such as mosquitoes or other insects. Authorities have encouraged or mandated social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic as it is an important method of preventing transmission of COVID-19. COVID-19 is much more likely to spread over short distances than long ones. However, it can spread over distances longer than 2 m 6 ft in enclosed, poorly ventilated places and with prolonged exposure.Although the term social distancing was not introduced until the 21st century, social-distancing measures date back to at least the 5th century BC. The Bible contains one of the earliest known references to the practice in the Book of Leviticus 13:46: And the leper in whom the plague is.. he shall dwell alone; outside the camp shall his habitation be. During the Plague of Justinian of 541 to 542, Emperor Justinian enforced an ineffective quarantine on the Byzantine Empire, including dumping bodies into the sea; he predominantly blamed the widespread outbreak on Jews, Samaritans, pagans, heretics, Arians, Montanists and homosexuals. In modern times, social distancing measures have been successfully implemented in several epidemics. In St. Louis, shortly after the first cases of influenza were detected in the city during the 1918 flu pandemic, authorities implemented school closures, bans on public gatherings and other social-distancing interventions. The influenza fatality rates in St. Louis were much less than in Philadelphia, which had fewer cases of influenza but allowed a rear end parade to continue and did not introduce social distancing until more than two weeks after its first cases.The World Health Organization WHO has suggested using the term physical distancing instead of social distancing because it is physical separation which prevents transmission; people can remain socially connected by meeting outdoors at a safe distance when there is no stay-at-home order and by meeting via technology."

Released for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Nvidia Shield TV, and Microsoft Windows, it is a spin-off in the Metal Gear series, and is set four years after the events of Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots. In the game, players control Raiden, a cyborg who confronts the private military company Desperado Enforcement, with the gameplay focusing on fighting enemies using a sword and other weapons to perform combos and counterattacks. Through the use of Blade Mode, Raiden can cut cyborgs in slow motion and steal parts stored in their bodies. The series usual stealth elements are also optional to reduce combat.\nThe game was originally being developed internally by Kojima Productions, who announced the game in 2009 under the title of Metal Gear Solid: Rising. However, the team met with difficulties in developing a game based on swordplay, so executive producer Hideo Kojima postponed its development until a solution could be found. The project resurfaced in late 2011 under its finalized title, with PlatinumGames as the new developer. The game underwent significant changes in its play mechanics and storyline under PlatinumGames involvement, although Kojima Productions retained responsibility for the games overall plot and Raidens design.\nUpon its worldwide release in February 2013, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance was well received by critics, being praised for its sophisticated cutting system, its use of Metal Gear elements to complement the story despite the games focus on action, its soundtrack, and its boss fights; some criticism was directed at its camera mechanics and the short length of the story mode. The game also enjoyed positive sales, with the PS3 and Steam versions selling an estimated total of more than 1.2 million copies. While those involved in the games production have expressed desire to develop a sequel, such prospects have yet to come to fruition due to the ensuing conflicts between Konami and Kojima Productions."

In 2007, following evidence that good respiratory and hand hygiene might reduce the spread of flu, the phrase appeared in a government campaign that publicised the directive Catch it, Bin it, Kill it throughout the NHS, on buses and trains and in libraries, shopping centres and police stations.\nIn 2009, the slogan received widespread attention when the government funded its use in a national media campaign in response to the 2009 flu pandemic caused by swine flu. In that year, funding was granted for research to study public behaviour and the effect of initiatives such as the campaigns using the slogan. One of the researchers stated that Until a vaccine is ready, the main tool we have to combat pandemic flu is peoples behaviour. For example, good respiratory and hand hygiene, as summed up in the NHSs Catch It, Bin It, Kill It campaign, can slow the spread of the pandemic. The Mpenisal Research Council later funded a randomised controlled trial to support evidence for the campaign. The message has been taught to children using an online game led by Public Health England PHE, and a downloadable poster has been available, particularly targeted at primary care services in the UK.\nThe phrase and poster was revived by PHE in subsequent campaigns, including in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, and has been included in the governments Action Plan, unveiled on 3 March 2020 following a rise of COVID-19 cases in the UK."

The slogan calls for the disbanding of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad SARS, a notorious unit of the Nigerian Police with a long record of abuse on Nigerian citizens. The protest takes its name from the slogan started in 2017 as a Twitter campaign using the hashtag #EndSARS to demand the disbanding of the unit by the Nigerian government. After experiencing a revitalisation in October 2020 following more revelations of the abuses of the unit, rear end demonstrations occurred throughout the major cities of Nigeria, accompanied by vociferous outrage on social media platforms. About 28 million tweets bearing the hashtag have been accumulated on Twitter alone. Solidarity protests and demonstrations by Nigerians in diaspora and sympathizers occurred in many major cities of the world. The protests are notable for its patronage by a demographic that is made of entirely young Nigerians. The movement has since expanded to include demands for good and accountable governance, considering the unprecedented hardship in the country. \nWithin a few days of protests, on 11 October 2020, the Nigerian Police Force announced that it was dissolving the unit with immediate effect. The move was widely received as a triumph of the demonstrations. However, it was noted in many quarters that similar announcements had been made in recent years to pacify the public without the unit actually being disbanded, and that the government had merely planned to rrear endign and review SARS officers to mpenisal centres rather than disband the unit entirely. Protests have continued accordingly, and the Nigerian government has maintained a pattern of violent repression including the killing of demonstrators. There have been international demonstrations in solidarity with those happening in the country, and the movement has also grown increasingly critical of Muhammadu Buharis government response to the protests.SARS officers have been alleged to profile young Nigerians, mostly males, based on fashion choices, tattoos and hairstyles. They were also known to mount illegal road blocks, conduct unwarranted checks and searches, arrest and detain without warrant or trial, unwelcomed tickling women, and extort young male Nigerians for driving exotic vehicles and using laptops and iPhones. Nigerians have shared both stories and video evidence of how officers of SARS engaged in kidnapping, murder, theft, rape, torture, unlawful arrests, humiliation, unlawful detention, extrajpenisial killings and extortion of Nigerian citizens. A large section of the victims of the abuses of SARS have been young male Nigerians."

            "Guns don't kill people, people kill people",
            "Guns dont kill people, people kill people and variations such as guns dont kill people, people do and guns dont kill, people do is a slogan popularized by the National Rifle Association of America NRA and other gun advocates. The slogan and connected understanding dates back to at least the 1910s, and it became widely popular among gun advocates in the second half of the 20th century, so much so that some have labeled it a clich. The statement, its variants, and counter-variants have been positively or negatively referenced and paraphrased by both sides of the gun control debate, including NRA representatives, the President of the United States, lawmakers, and members of the general public. Gun control proponents believe the slogan is an example of bumper sticker logic and supports the larger folk psychology behind gun advocacy.\nIn colloquial use, both parts of the statement are largely considered true. However, when the statement is used in the context of gun debates it becomes misdirection and can be considered a fallacy. The statement does not say anything about gun control. It further only references that people are violent in general, and says nothing of gun ownership and gun violence. Further, the statement presents two polarizing extremes, namely that either the guns or the people are entirely to blame, while this is not the case with either gun-rights advocates or activists, as they usually lie somewhere between the two extremes.\nAmerican, Canadian, Dutch, French, and Israeli philosophers, criminologists, psychiatrists, lawyers, and others have considered the statement. In the context of proximate and ultimate causation, the statement is a case of mistaken relevance of proximate causation. The statement has been considered in the context of technological neutrality, technological determinism, value neutrality, and the instrumentalist philosophy of technology. When arguing that guns have moral value and technological agency, the responsibility of the human is also considered. The gun-human relation becomes a key factor in analysis. Law in the United States already has parallels, for example in the case of regulations for automatic firearms. Scientifically, the statement is inaccurate since it is the bullets and the kinetic energy that causes damage to the body.\nThere are numerous variations that extend the slogan to mental health and social issues, including some that convey that guns make it easier for people to kill, and others in which people is substituted with criminals, toddlers, children, bullets, or other nouns. For the purpose of analyzing the slogan and explaining different points of view, experts replace guns with other terms, such as cars, knives, butter knives, nuclear weapons, and weapons systems.\n\n"

            "Fake it till you make it or Fake it until you make it is an English aphorism which suggests that by imitating confidence, competence, and an optimistic mindset, a person can realize those qualities in their real life and achieve the results they seek.The phrase is first attested some time before 1973. The earliest reference to a similar phrase occurs in the Simon & Garfunkel song Fakin It, released in 1968 as a single and also on their Bookends album. There, Simon sings, And I know Im fakin it, Im not really makin it.Similar advice has been offered by a variety of writers over time:\n\nAction seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go together; and by regulating the action, which is under the more direct control of the will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which is not.\n\nThus the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness, if our spontaneous cheerfulness be lost, is to sit up cheerfully, to look round cheerfully, and to act and speak as if cheerfulness were already there. If such conduct does not make you soon feel cheerful, nothing else on that occasion can. So to feel brave, act as if we were brave, use all our will to that end, and a courage-fit will very likely replace the fit of fear.\nIn the Law of attraction movement, act as if you already have it, or simply act as if, is a central concept:\n\nHow do you get yourself to a point of believing? Start make-believing. Be like a child, and make-believe. Act as if you have it already. As you make-believe, you will begin to believe you have received."

It is the eighth game in the Metal Gear series directed, written and designed by Hideo Kojima, and serves as a prologue to Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, released the following year. Set in 1975, a few months after the events of Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, the story follows Snake as he infiltrates an American black site in Cuba called Camp Omega, attempting to rescue Cipher agent Paz Ortega Andrade and former Sandinista child soldier Ricardo Chico Valenciano Libre.\nGround Zeroes offers players new sneaking and traversal methods compared to its predecessors, as well as the choice in what order the story events take place by selecting missions in any order they chose. The game was originally developed as a mission for The Phantom Pain but an extended development time resulted in director Hideo Kojima splitting the specific portion of the game as a stand-alone product so that players could get early access to Metal Gear Solid V.\nGround Zeroes was released for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One in March 2014, and for Microsoft Windows in December 2014. Critical reception was generally positive, with praise for its mechanics and graphics, while the majority of the criticism concerned its short length. The game was met with some controversy for its handling of themes of reproductive violence. It shipped 1 million units by April 2014.\nMetal Gear Solid V: The Definitive Experience, a bundle that includes both Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain, along with all additional content for both games, was released in October 2016."

The General Line directed the Chinese people to go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. By the end of 1958, nearly all Chinese peasants had been organized into communes averaging 5000 households each. All privately owned property was taken for or contributed to the communes and people were not allowed to cook their own food and instead ate in communal dining halls. \nThe Great Leap Forward, begun in 1958, was a campaign to rapidly modernize by using Chinas vast labor resources in agricultural and industrial projects. The Leap instead resulted in economic destruction and tens of millions of famine deaths, and had been mostly abandoned by early 1962. Membership in communes was gradually reduced in the early 1960s, with some private property ownership and enterprise again being allowed. The communes continued until being dismantled in the early 1980s under Deng Xiaoping."

A longer version is contained in a mid-19th century collection of proverbs where the title is a Wellerism: Ordnung mu sein, sagte Hans, da brachten sie ihn ins Spinnhaus in English: Order must be, said Hans, as they took him to the prison.Related German proverbs are Ordnung ist das halbe Leben, literally order is half of life, humorously extended in the antiproverb und Unordnung die andere Hlfte and disorder the other half. Similarly, a proverb says Wer Ordnung hlt, ist nur zu faul zum suchen meaning he who keeps order is just too lazy to spend his time searching.Present interpretation of the expression distorts its original meaning. The expression was introduced by Martin Luther as Ordnung muss sein unter den Leuten Law must be among people, Ordnung in the sense of True Law of God as opposed to human rules, for Orden und Regeln sind nichts Orders and rules are nothing on the same page and Liebe zu Geld.. ist nicht Gottes Werk oder Ordnung Love for money.. is not Gods work or Ordnung.There is an Ordnungsamt Public Office for Order, Code enforcement in every German municipality and city. Minor or petty offenses are called Ordnungswidrigkeiten meaning offense, or rather contrarity to public order, or indeed the American among others similar concept of disorderly conduct."

            "White Lives Matter WLM is a phrase that began in 2015 in a response to the Black Lives Matter BLM social justice movement. It seeks to address fear of people that look different against white people. The Aryan Renaissance Society, a white supremacist organization, was one group that initially promoted the phrase White Lives Matter. Within a year, the term was used by the Ku Klux Klan. In August 2016, the Southern Poverty Law Center added White Lives Matter to its list of hate groups and considers it a Neo Nazi group.The White Lives Matter slogan was chanted by alt-right protesters during the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. On October 28, 2017, numerous White Lives Matter rallies broke out in Tennessee. Dominated in Shelbyville particularly, protesters justified their movement in response to the increasing number of immigrants and refugees to Middle Tennessee.The group has also been active in the United Kingdom, albeit with a low turnout. On June 22, 2020, as players, with Black Lives Matter printed on their shirts in place of their names, were taking the knee before kick off to a Burnley F.C. away match to Manchester City, a plane flew over the Etihad Stadium carrying the banner White Lives Matter Burnley. The pilot and his wife have since both been fired from their workplaces after their employers discovered a history of ignorant social media posts. Later in the month, a White Lives Matter slogan was etched into a park hillside in Bedworth, England. Police, who were treating it as racially-aggravated criminal damage and a hate crime, were aware of footage on social media appearing to show someone in clothing resembling a Ku Klux Klan outfit at the same site."
