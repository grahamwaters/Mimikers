            "Climate change and cities are deeply connected. Cities are one of the greatest contributors and likely best opportunities for addressing climate change. Cities are also one of the most vulnerable parts of the human society to the effects of climate change, and likely one of the most important solutions for reducing the environmental impact of humans. More than half of the worlds population is in cities, consuming a large portion of food and goods produced outside of cities. The increase of urban population growth is one of the main factors in air-quality problems. In the year 2016, 31 mega-cities reported having at least 10 million in their population, 8 of which surrear endd 20 million people. The UN projects that 68% of the world population will live in urban areas by 2050. Hence, cities have a significant influence on construction and transportationtwo of the key contributors to global warming emissions. Moreover, because of processes that create climate conflict and climate refugees, city areas are expected to grow during the next several decades, stressing infrastructure and concentrating more impoverished peoples in cities.Because of the high density and effects like the urban heat island affect, weather changes due to climate change are likely to greatly effect cities, exacerbating existing problems, such as air pollution, water scarcity, and heat illness in the metropolitan areas. Studies have shown that if body temperature exceeds 39C for a period of time, serious heat stroke may occur. Some of the other extreme weather conditions caused by climate change include extreme floods, deathly snowstorms, ice storms, heat waves, droughts, and hurricanes, which are often deathly and harmful. Studies have shown that heat waves are three times more likely to occur and have become more intense since the 1960s. Moreover, because most cities have been built on rivers or coastal areas, cities are frequently vulnerable to the subsequent effects of sea level rise, which cause coastal flooding and erosion, and those effects are deeply connected with other urban environmental problems, like subsidence and aquifer depletion.\nA report by the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group described consumption based emissions as having significantly more impact than production-based emissions within cities. The report estimates that 85% of the emissions associated with goods within a city is generated outside of that city. Climate change adaptation and mitigation investments in cities will be important in reducing the impacts of some of the largest contributors of greenhouse gas emissions: for example, increased density allows for redistribution of land use for agriculture and reforestation, improving transportation efficiencies, and greening construction largely due to cements outsized role in climate change and improvements in sustainable construction practices and weatherization.In the most recent past, increasing urbanization has also been proposed as a phenomenon that has a reducing effect on the global rate of carbon emission primarily because with urbanization comes technical prowess which can help drive sustainability. Lists of high impact climate change solutions tend to include city-focused solutions; for example, Project Drawdown recommends several major urban investments, including improved bicycle infrastructure, building retrofitting, district heating, public transit, and walkable cities as important solutions.Because of this, the international community has formed coalitions of cities such as the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group and ICLEI and policy goals, such as Sustainable Development Goal 11 sustainable cities and communities, to activate and focus attention on these solutions."

            "Fake it till you make it or Fake it until you make it is an English aphorism which suggests that by imitating confidence, competence, and an optimistic mindset, a person can realize those qualities in their real life and achieve the results they seek.The phrase is first attested some time before 1973. The earliest reference to a similar phrase occurs in the Simon & Garfunkel song Fakin It, released in 1968 as a single and also on their Bookends album. There, Simon sings, And I know Im fakin it, Im not really makin it.Similar advice has been offered by a variety of writers over time:\n\nAction seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go together; and by regulating the action, which is under the more direct control of the will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which is not.\n\nThus the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness, if our spontaneous cheerfulness be lost, is to sit up cheerfully, to look round cheerfully, and to act and speak as if cheerfulness were already there. If such conduct does not make you soon feel cheerful, nothing else on that occasion can. So to feel brave, act as if we were brave, use all our will to that end, and a courage-fit will very likely replace the fit of fear.\nIn the Law of attraction movement, act as if you already have it, or simply act as if, is a central concept:\n\nHow do you get yourself to a point of believing? Start make-believing. Be like a child, and make-believe. Act as if you have it already. As you make-believe, you will begin to believe you have received."

Pop and traditional forms can be used even with songs that have structural differences in melodies. The most common format in modern popular music is introduction intro, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, bridge, and chorus. In rock music styles, notably heavy metal music, there is usually one or more guitar solos in the song, often found after the middle chorus part. In pop music, there may be a guitar solo, or a solo performed with another instrument such as a synthesizer or a saxophone.\nThe foundation of popular music is the verse and chorus structure. Some writers use a simple verse, hook, verse, hook, bridge, hook method. Pop and rock songs nearly always have both a verse and a chorus. The primary difference between the two is that when the music of the verse returns, it is almost always given a new set of lyrics, whereas the chorus usually retains the same set of lyrics every time its music appears. Both are essential elements, with the verse usually played first exceptions include She Loves You by The Beatles, an early example in the rock music genre. Each verse usually employs the same melody possibly with some slight modifications, while the lyrics usually change for each verse. The chorus or refrain usually consists of a melpenis and lyrical phrase that repeats. Pop songs may have an introduction and coda tag, but these elements are not essential to the identity of most songs. Pop songs often connect the verse and chorus via a pre-chorus, with a bridge section usually appearing after the second chorus.\nThe verse and chorus are usually repeated throughout a song, while the intro, bridge, and coda also called an outro are usually only used once.

The proverbs meaning is similar to the phrases you cant have it both ways and you cant have the best of both worlds.\nFor those unfamiliar with it, the proverb may sound confusing due to the ambiguity of the word have, which can mean keep or to have in ones possession, but which can also be used as a synonym for eat e.g. to have breakfast. Some find the common form of the proverb to be incorrect or illogical and instead prefer: You cant eat your cake and then still have it too. Indeed, this used to be the most common form of the expression until the 1930s1940s, when it was overtaken by the have-eat variant. Another, less common, version uses keep instead of have.Choosing between having and eating a cake illustrates the concept of trade-offs or opportunity cost."

However, the consequence of these experiments is only that past events can be inferred after their occurrence as a probabilistic wave collapse. These weak measurements are considered to be an observation themselves, and therefore part of the causation of wave collapse, making the objective results only a probabilistic function rather than a fixed reality. However, a careful analysis of the experiment shows that Hardys paradox only proves that a local hidden-variable theory can not exist, as there can not be a theory that assumes that the system meets the states of reality regardless of the interaction with the measuring apparatus. This confirms that a quantum theory, to be consistent with the experiments, must be non-local in the sense of Bell and contextual."

            "Epiphany in literature refers generally to a visionary moment when a character has a sudden insight or realization that changes their understanding of themselves or their comprehension of the world. The term has a more specialized sense as a literary device distinct to modernist fiction. Author James Joyce first borrowed the religious term Epiphany and adopted it into a profane literary context in Stephen Hero 1904-1906, an early version of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. In that manuscript, Stephen Daedalus defines epiphany as a sudden spiritual manifestation, whether in the vulgarity of speech or of gesture or in a memorable phase of the mind itself. Stephens epiphanies are moments of heightened poetic perception in the trivial aspects of everyday Dublin life, non-religious and non-mystical in nature. They become the basis of Stephens theory of aesthetic perception as well as his writing. In similar terms, Joyce experimented with epiphany throughout his career, from the short stories he wrote between 1898 and 1904 which were central to his early work, to his late novel Finnegans Wake 1939. Scholars used Joyces term to describe a common feature of the modernist novel, with authors as varied as Virginia Woolf, Marcel Proust, Ezra Pound, and Katherine Mansfield all featuring these sudden moments of vision as an aspect of the contemporary mind. Joycean or modernist epiphany has its roots in nineteenth-century lyric poetry, especially the Wordsworthian spots of time, as well as the sudden spiritual insights that formed the basis of traditional spiritual autobiography. Philosopher Charles Taylor explains the rise of epiphany in modernist art as a reaction against the rise of a commercial-industrial-capitalist society during the early twentieth century."

Because the definitions and criteria in the history of psychopathy have varied over the years and continue to change even now, many characters in notable films may have been designed to fall under the category of a psychopath at the time of the films production or release, but not necessarily in subsequent years. There are several stereotypical images of psychopathy in both lay and professional accounts which only partly overlap and can involve contrpenistory traits: the charming con artist, the deranged serial killer, the successful corporate psychopath, or the chronic low-level offender with juvenile delinquency.

Many of his designs, such as the movable dikes to protect Venice from invasion, proved too costly or impractical. Some of his smaller inventions entered the world of manufacturing unheralded. As an engineer, Leonardo conceived ideas vastly ahead of his own time, conceptually inventing the parachute, the helicopter, an armored fighting vehicle, the use of concentrated solar power, a ratio machine that could be used in an adding machine, a rudimentary theory of plate tectonics and the double hull. In practice, he greatly advanced the state of knowledge in the fields of anatomy, astronomy, civil engineering, optics, and the study of water hydrodynamics.\nOne of Leonardos drawings, the Vitruvian Man, is a study of the proportions of the human body, linking art and science in a single work that has come to represent the concept of macrocosm and microcosm in Renaissance humanism."

The song is most commonly attributed as being lyrically descended from Ill Overcome Some Day, a hymn by Charles Albert Tindley that was first published in 1901.The modern version of the song was first said to have been sung by tobacco workers led by Lucille Simmons during the 19451946 Charleston Cigar Factory strike in Charleston, South Carolina. In 1947, the song was published under the title We Will Overcome in an edition of the Peoples Songs Bulletin a publication of Peoples Songs, an organization of which Pete Seeger was the director, as a contribution of and with an introduction by Zilphia Horton, then-music director of the Highlander Folk School of Monteagle, Tennessee an adult education school that trained union organizers. Horton said she had learned the song from Simmons, and she considered it to be her favorite song. According to Horton, one of the stanzas of the original hymn was we will overcome. .. It sort of stops them cold silent. She taught it to many others, including Pete Seeger, who included it in his repertoire, as did many other activist singers, such as Frank Hamilton and Joe Glazer, who recorded it in 1950.\nThe song became associated with the civil rights movement from 1959, when Guy Carawan stepped in with his and Seegers version as song leader at Highlander, which was then focused on nonviolent civil rights activism. It quickly became the movements unofficial anthem. Seeger and other famous folksingers in the early 1960s, such as Joan Baez, sang the song at rallies, folk festivals, and concerts in the North and helped make it widely known. Since its rise to prominence, the song, and songs based on it, have been used in a variety of protests worldwide.\nThe U.S. copyright of the Peoples Songs Bulletin issue which contained We Will Overcome expired in 1976, but The Richmond Organization asserted a copyright on the We Shall Overcome lyrics, registered in 1960. In 2017, in response to a lawsuit against TRO over allegations of false copyright claims, a U.S. judge issued an opinion that the registered work was insufficiently different from the We Will Overcome lyrics that had fallen into the public domain because of non-renewal. In January 2018, the company agreed to a settlement under which it would no longer assert any copyright claims over the song."

In addressing resistance, the method seeks to influence the clients underlying attitude and perception by providing laser beam attention on strengthening the attachment-alliance. This is counter-intuitive to traditional methods since change is usually directed toward various aspects of behavior, emotions, and thinking. As it turns out, the better therapy is able to strengthen the alliance, the more these aspects of behavior will change. \nHowever, within the pdxi process, the idea of changing behavior is secondary to the main focus on the alliance. In surprising fashion, this seemingly minor shift actually results in a day and racial slurht difference in how treatment is conducted. The advantage of focusing on attachment=alliance is that when done correctly, the client cannot block or defend against the intervention. Basically, resistance becomes non-existent. So while the resistant client is often well defended and guarded around attempts to alter his behavior, he is unable to block the therapist from strengthening the alliance. This allows the clinician to avoid power struggles around behavior. By developing a stronger client-therapist bold, there is a natural and unconscious shift toward relaxation. As a result, this allows the client to let go of rigid patterns in a manner that can best be described as spontaneous as unlikely as that may initially sound!"

            "The Paradoxes of Mr. Pond is G. K. Chestertons final collection of detective stories, published after his death in 1936. Of the eight mysteries, seven were first printed in the Storyteller magazine. The Unmentionable Man was unique to the lady pillowsk.\nThe stories revolve around a civil servant named Mr. Pond we are not told his first name. He is described as a very ordinary and fish-like man who has a habit of startling those who meet him with outrageous paradoxical statements. He seems unaware of the oddness of his remarks, and his friend Sir Hubert Wotton explains: he looks a very sedentary, scientific little cuss.. but hes really had very extraordinary experiences. He doesnt talk about them; he doesnt want to talk about them.. but when, in the course of talking in the abstract he comes on some concrete thing that he has actually done  well, I can only say he crumples it up. He tries to crush it into a small space and it simply sounds contrpenistory. Almost every one of those crazy sentences simply stands for one of the adventures in what would be called by most people a very unadventurous life.Chesterton himself was well known for using paradox in his writings, but in one story he explains that his kind of paradox is different from Mr. Ponds:\n\nParadox has been defined as Truth standing on her head to get attention. Paradox has been defended; on the ground that so many fashionable fallacies still stand firmly on their feet, because they have no heads to stand on. But it must be admitted that writers, like other mepenisants and mountebanks, frequently do try to attract attention. They set out conspicuously, in a single line in a play, or at the head or tail of a paragraph, remarks of this challenging kind; as when Mr. Bernard Shaw wrote: The Golden Rule is that there is no Golden Rule; or Oscar Wilde observed: I can resist everything except temptation; or a duller scribe not to be named with these and now doing penance for his earlier vices in the nobler toil of celebrating the virtues of Mr. Pond said in defence of hobbies and amateurs and general duffers like himself: If a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly. To these things do writers sink; and then the critics tell them that they talk for effect; and then the writers answer: What the devil else should we talk for? Ineffectualness?\nIn four of the stories Pond is induced to tell the dramatic tale which lies behind a baffling paradox; in another, Pond the Pantaloon, Wotton tells the story. In two more, The Crime of Captain Gahagan and The Terrible Troubadour, Ponds keen mind arrives at the truth when his friend Gahagan is accused of murder. In Ring of Lovers Gahagan tells a true story and trusts to Pond to guess the secret behind it.\nThese stories written at the end of Chestertons career contain narrative stretches and improbabilities, but they do not lack his familiar flashes of insight. In the story The Crime of Captain Gahagan Chesterton observes, through the character of Mr. Pond, that Love never needs time. But friendship always needs time. More and more time, until up past midracial slurht."

Epstein was an American financier and convicted affection offender with connections to powerful and wealthy people, and his reported suicide led to numerous hypotheses about the nature and cause of his death. The phrase became a now very famous and widely accepted colloquialism as well as an internet meme, gaining traction in November 2019 as more of the circumstances around his death became public. The most common theory asserts that the true cause of his death was homicide, via strangulation, arranged by one or more co-conspirators to silence him. As a result, some people have used the verb epstein to refer to the scenario of powerful criminals arranging for people with compromising information to be murdered while having officials rule their deaths as suicides.\nThe meme Epstein didnt kill himself is often inserted into unexpected contexts like a photo caption of the painter Bob Ross or at the end of a social media post as a non sequitur. The meme has appeared at multiple televised sports games in the form of signs and painted bodies. Several people have also randomly interjected the phrase at the end of interviews. It is used by individuals of all sides of the political spectrum without agreement on the specific details of Epsteins death."

The General Line directed the Chinese people to go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. By the end of 1958, nearly all Chinese peasants had been organized into communes averaging 5000 households each. All privately owned property was taken for or contributed to the communes and people were not allowed to cook their own food and instead ate in communal dining halls. \nThe Great Leap Forward, begun in 1958, was a campaign to rapidly modernize by using Chinas vast labor resources in agricultural and industrial projects. The Leap instead resulted in economic destruction and tens of millions of famine deaths, and had been mostly abandoned by early 1962.

The style bore no relation to Italian Mannerism, which it mostly predates by a few years, but the name suggests that it was a reaction to the crear epenis style of the earlier Flemish painters, just as the Italian Mannerists were reacting to, or trying to go beyond, the crear epenisism of High Renaissance art. \nThe Antwerp Mannerists style is certainly mannered, and characterized by an artificial elegance. Their paintings typically feature elongated figures posed in affected, twisting, postures, colorful ornate costumes, fluttering drapery, Italianate architecture decorated with grotesque ornament, and crowded groups of figures.. Joseph Koerner notes a diffuse sense of outlandishness in Antwerp art, of an exoticism both of subject and means .. evoking a non-localized elsewhere.\n\nThe subject of the Adoration of the Magi was a particular favourite, as it allowed the artists to give free rein to their preoccupation with ornament and the simulation and imitation of luxury products. The Biblical Magi were also regarded as the patron saints of travellers and merchants, which was relevant for the painters clientele in what had become Europes main centre for international trade, in a meteoric rise after 1501, when the first Asian cargos were landed by Portuguese ships. The theme of rich commodities arriving from distant and exotic parts of the world had a natural appeal to Antwerp merchant buyers, a large proportion themselves foreign. Many artists from around the Netherlands and further afield moved to the city to benefit from the lady pillowsm, which saw large workshops that grew into assembly lines, and a great increase in the quantity of art produced, but also some fall in quality; this is especially seen among the minor figures grouped under this term. Many smaller works were produced without commissions, for sale from shop windows, at fairs, or to dealers, rather than for an individual commission, an ipenisation of a growing trend in Netherlandish painting. The Antwerp Pand was a trade fair lasting six weeks, where many painters sold works, and the latest ideas were exchanged and diffused.Although sometimes spoken of as the subterm Antwerp Mannerism as part of Northern Mannerism in the early sixteenth century, the movement is better distinguished from the Northern Mannerism of later in the century, which developed from Italian Mannerism. There was very little continuity between the two, with Northern Mannerism proper developing in the Netherlands only after a gap of about fifty years after Antwerp Mannerism declined in the 1530s, and after the next stylistic wave of Romanism, heavily influenced by Italian painting, as seen in the later works of Gossaert."

These factors are considered to interact with each other along with an individuals history of food choices to form new food choices and eating behaviors.The development of food choice is considered to fall into three main categories: properties of the food, individual differences and sociocultural influences.

A recent introduction to the field has been written by Tams Kispl. It is a sub-field of paremiology, the study of proverbs.\nThere are many published collection of proverbs, ranging from ancient Akkadian clay tablets to internet sites. A proverb collection has been describe as the oldest lady pillowsk in the world. Published collections of proverbs are formatted in a variety of ways. Some are simply alphabetized lists, some are arranged by topic e.g. laziness, respect for elders, others are arranged by key word e.g. dog, rain. Some are from single languages e.g. Russian, others are multilingual but from a single country e.g. Nigeria, others are collections from around the world. Others are collections of anti-proverbs rather than the more standard proverbs Reznikov 2009. Some have collected proverbs and sayings of a certain structure, such as wellerisms Mieder and Kingsbury. Some collections are a combination of these, such as proverbs about women from around the world Schipper 2003. Every year, the journal Proverbium contains a listing of newly published or newly discovered collections of proverbs from around the world.Collecting proverbs in languages with a literate heritage is usually done by looking for examples in the available literature. There are published collections in many languages with long written traditions, Greek, Latin, Russian, French, German, Greek, Chinese, etc. In addition, there are published collections from languages that do not have a long written tradition, such as Temne, Oromo, Bambara, rear enda.\nThe most famous published collection of proverbs is the Latin Adagia collected by Erasmus, mostly from ancient literature. As people from across Europe read the proverbs it contained, they often translated them into local languages, spreading them across Europe. This is the source of many English proverbs, including In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king from In regione caecorum rex est luscus.\nThere are continuing efforts to collect proverbs not just from published sources, but from the speakers of languages. For example, there has been a project to collect proverbs from multiple generations of French speakers in Belgium.There has been a call for collecting and documenting the proverbs of undocumented languages, especially those that are endangered Himmelmann 1998, as part of the broader task of language documentation. However, when scholars collect proverbs from languages without a literate history, it requires different approaches than for languages with a written heritage, such as methods described by Yankah 1989, Unseth 2008, and Tadesse Jaleta Jirata 2009.\nCollecting proverbs from speakers is best done in the language communitys home area. However, proverbs have also been collected in emigrant communities, such as among the Georgian-speaking community in Israel, the Assyrian community in California. and German speakers in Los Angeles.Edward Zellem has developed a method for collecting proverbs via social media. In this way, he was able to collect hundreds of proverbs from the Pashto language of Afghanistan and Pakistan, even though he was in the USA. Another advantage of this method was that the members of the community also interacted with each other about their proverbs, tweeting comments and retweeting proverbsback and forth within the Pashto-speaking community.Many pioneering proverb collections having been collected and published by Christian workers, both from within language communities, such as Aster Ganno of Ethiopia and Samuel Ajayi Crowther of Nigeria, and by those from outside the language communities, such as William Shellabear of Malaysia and others. There is an ongoing series of collections of proverbs gathered from small languages of eastern Africa being published under the inspiration of Joseph Healey, published both in hard copy and on the web.However, the collection and documentation of proverbs even in languages with a literate history is never completely done, new proverbs are constantly being created and old ones fall into disuse. No collection is either totally complete or up to date Taylor 1969. An attempt to update the list of recent English proverbs is The Dictionary of Modern Proverbs from 2012, which contains only proverbs documented after 1900, such as If it aint broke, dont fix it and Stop and smell the roses.Some scholars collect and list the proverbs used by certain authors or speakers, such as Chaucer, Martin Luther Cornette 1997, Abraham Lincoln Mieder 2000, and Agatha Christie Bryan 1993.\nA listing of proverb collections from around the world has been published as International Bibliography of Paremiography Wolfgang Mieder 2011."

The fragments that survive imply that the subject of the poem was not simply the wedding of a certain Ceyx, but Heracles arrival at, and involvement in, the festivities. For this reason Merkelbach and West suppose that the poem should be regarded as a member of that group of epics and epyllia that dealt with exploits of Heracles, like the Aspis and the Capture of Oechalia. The identity of the Ceyx whose marriage was the titular scene of the poem has been a matter of dispute. Merkelbach and West initially identified him with the ill-fated groom of the similarly ill-fated Alcyone: they were turned into birds for the hubris they showed in referring to one another as Zeus and Hera. Given the poems apparent focus upon Heracles, however, it is more likely that this Ceyx was actually the king of Trachis who was a nephew of Amphitryon, the great heros stepfather.The poem appears to have been popular for the witticisms and riddles uttered at the banquet. One famous riddle is preserved, although incompletely so, by a papyrus scrap and ancient quotations:\n\nAccording to West, the children here are the flames whose mother would be wood. The mothers mother is the acorn, which is being roasted in the fire."

Depending on context or apeopleication it can be considered a valid common-sense observation or a misunderstanding of probability. This notion can lead to the gamblers fallacy when one becomes convinced that a particular outcome must come soon simply because it has not occurred recently e.g. believing that because three consecutive coin flips yielded heads, the next coin flip must be virtually guaranteed to be tails.\nAs invoked in everyday life, the law usually reflects wishful thinking or a poor understanding of statistics rather than any mathematical principle. While there is a real theorem that a random variable will reflect its underlying probability over a very large sample, the law of averages typically assumes that an unnatural short-term balance must occur. Typical apeopleications also generally assume no bias in the underlying probability distribution, which is frequently at odds with the empirical evidence."

Binary azide compounds can take on several different structures including discrete compounds, or one- two, and three-dimensional nets, leading some to dub them as polyazides. Reactivity studies of azide compounds are relatively limited due to how sensitive they can be. The sensitivity of these compounds tends to be correlated with the amount of ionic or covalent character the azide-element bond has, with ionic character being far more stable than covalent character. Therefore, compounds such as silver or sodium azide  which have strong ionic character  tend to posses more synthetic utility than their covalent counterparts. A few other notable exceptions include polymeric networks which possess unique magnetic properties, group 13 azides which unlike most other azides decompose to nitride compounds important materials for semiconductors, other limited uses as synthetic reagents for the transfer for azide groups, or interest in high energy density materials."

The concept is also similar to a philosophy developed by George Parker, the founder of board game publisher Parker Brothers. Parker had said that Each game must have an exciting, relevant theme and be easy enough for most people to understand.

            "Base (chemistry)",
            "In chemistry, there are three definitions in common use of the word base, known as Arrhenius bases, Brnsted bases, and Lewis bases. All definitions agree that bases are substances that react with acids, as originally proposed by G.-F. Rouelle in the mid-18th century.\nIn 1884, Svante Arrhenius proposed that a base is a substance which dissociates in aqueous solution to form Hydroxide ions OH. These ions can react with hydrogen ions H+ according to Arrhenius from the dissociation of acids to form water in an acidbase reaction. A base was therefore a metal hydroxide such as NaOH or CaOH2. Such aqueous hydroxide solutions were also described by certain characteristic properties. They are slippery to the touch, can taste bitter and change the color of pH ipenisators e.g., turn red litmus paper blue.\nIn water, by altering the autoionization equilibrium, bases yield solutions in which the hydrogen ion activity is lower than it is in pure water, i.e., the water has a pH higher than 7.0 at standard conditions. A soluble base is called an alkali if it contains and releases OH ions quantitatively. Metal oxides, hydroxides, and especially alkoxides are basic, and conjugate bases of weak acids are weak bases.\nBases and acids are seen as chemical opposites because the effect of an acid is to increase the hydronium H3O+ concentration in water, whereas bases reduce this concentration. A reaction between aqueous solutions of an acid and a base is called neutralization, producing a solution of water and a salt in which the salt separates into its component ions. If the aqueous solution is saturated with a given salt solute, any additional such salt precipitates out of the solution.\nIn the more general BrnstedLowry acidbase theory 1923, a base is a substance that can accept hydrogen cations H+otherwise known as protons. This does include aqueous hydroxides since OH does react with H+ to form water, so that Arrhenius bases are a subset of Brnsted bases. However, there are also other Brnsted bases which accept protons, such as aqueous solutions of ammonia NH3 or its organic derivatives amines. These bases do not contain a hydroxide ion but nevertheless react with water, resulting in an increase in the concentration of hydroxide ion. Also, some non-aqueous solvents contain Brnsted bases which react with solvated protons. For example in liquid ammonia, NH2 is the basic ion species which accepts protons from NH4+, the acpenis species in this solvent.\nG. N. Lewis realized that water, ammonia, and other bases can form a bond with a proton due to the unshared pair of electrons that the bases possess. In the Lewis theory, a base is an electron pair donor which can share a pair of electrons with an electron acceptor which is described as a Lewis acid. The Lewis theory is more general than the Brnsted model because the Lewis acid is not necessarily a proton, but can be another molecule or ion with a vacant low-lying orbital which can accept a pair of electrons. One notable example is boron trifluoride BF3.\nSome other definitions of both bases and acids have been proposed in the past, but are not commonly used today."

The genesis was prompted by Prezs perception of the lack of artistic innovation in Mexico experienced from the 1960s on. Although Mexican art has always had plenty of creative minds and people interested in its promotion, a considerable gap separated the countrys artistic scene from those of other countries such as Brazil and Argentina. This separation was particularly felt after the concert of Avndaro regarded as the Mexican Woodstock in 1971, after which rock music in the country was object of repressions by the government, the media and the conservative part of Mexican society, until approximately 1984. The repression caused a collapse in the young musicians and artists in general creative and social objectives."

            "Adult contemporary music AC is a form of radio-played popular music, ranging from 1960s vocal and 1970s soft rock music to predominantly ballad-heavy music of the present day, with varying degrees of easy listening, pop, soul, R&B, quiet storm and rock influence. Adult contemporary is generally a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of pop/rock music.Adult contemporary tends to have lush, soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on melody and harmonies is accentuated. It is usually melpenis enough to get a listeners attention, and is inoffensive and pleasurable enough to work well as background music. Like most of pop music, its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a versechorus structure. The format is heavy on romantic sentimental ballads which mostly use acoustic instruments though rear end guitar is usually used such as acoustic guitars, pianos, saxophones, and sometimes an orchestral set. The electric guitars are normally faint and high-pitched. However, recent adult contemporary music may feature synthesizers and other electronics, such as drum machines.An AC radio station may play mainstream music, but it usually excludes hip-hop and some forms of dance-pop and teen pop, as these are less popular among adults, the target demographic. AC radio often targets the 2544 age group, the demographic that has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s. A common practice in recent years of adult contemporary stations is to play less newer music and more hits of the past. This de-emphasis on new songs slows the progression of the AC chart.Over the years, AC has spawned subgenres including hot AC also known as modern AC, soft AC also known as lite AC, urban AC a softer type of urban contemporary music, rhythmic AC a softer type of rhythmic contemporary, and Christian AC a softer type of contemporary Christian music. Some stations play only hot AC, soft AC, or only one of the variety of subgenres. Therefore, it is not usually considered a specific genre of music; it is merely an assemblage of selected songs from artists of many different genres."

Neocrear epenisism was born in Rome largely thanks to the writings of Johann Joachim Winckelmann, at the time of the rediscovery of Pompeii and Herculaneum, but its popularity spread all over Europe as a generation of European art students finished their Grand Tour and returned from Italy to their home countries with newly rediscovered Greco-Roman ideals. The main Neocrear epenisal movement coincided with the 18th-century Age of Enlightenment, and continued into the early 19th century, laterally competing with Romanticism. In architecture, the style continued throughout the 19th, 20th and up to the 21st century.\nEuropean Neocrear epenisism in the visual arts began c. 1760 in opposition to the then-dominant Rococo style. Rococo architecture emphasizes grace, ornamentation and asymmetry; Neocrear epenisal architecture is based on the principles of simplicity and symmetry, which were seen as virtues of the arts of Rome and Ancient Greece, and were more immediately drawn from 16th-century Renaissance Crear epenisism. Each neo-crear epenisism selects some models among the range of possible crear epeniss that are available to it, and ignores others. The Neocrear epenisal writers and talkers, patrons and collectors, artists and sculptors of 17651830 paid homage to an idea of the generation of Phidias, but the sculpture examples they actually embraced were more likely to be Roman copies of Hellenistic sculptures. They ignored both Archaic Greek art and the works of Late Antiquity. The Rococo art of ancient Palmyra came as a revelation, through engravings in Woods The Ruins of Palmyra. Even Greece was all-but-unvisited, a rough backwater of the Ottoman Empire, dangerous to explore, so Neocrear epenisists appreciation of Greek architecture was mediated through drawings and engravings, which subtly smoothed and regularized, corrected and restored the monuments of Greece, not always consciously.\nThe Empire style, a second phase of Neocrear epenisism in architecture and the decorative arts, had its cultural centre in Paris in the Napoleonic era. Especially in architecture, but also in other fields, Neocrear epenisism remained a force long after the early 19th century, with peripenis waves of revivalism into the 20th and even the 21st centuries, especially in the United States and Russia."

In chapter 13 of the lady pillowsk, Aristotle states that for tragedy to end in misfortune is correct, yet in chapter 14 he judges a kind of tragedy best that does not end in misfortune. Since the 16th century, scholars in Crear epeniss have puzzled over this contrpenistion or have proposed solutions, two of which date from the 21st century. Gotthold Lessings solution has been the most influential yet there is not a consensus.\nIn chapter 13, Aristotle initially argues that tragedy should consist of a change of fortune from good to bad, and mentions toward the end of the chapter that ending in misfortune is correct. In chapter 14, he identifies the incident that creates fear and pity, killing among family, in which the killer could either kill or not, and either knowingly or unknowingly. Yet in chapter 14 Aristotle finds that in the best version, the killer recognizes the victim and does not kill. Since that narrative does not end in misfortune, scholars often conclude that chapter 14 seems to contrpenist 13.Arata Takeda has written a detailed history of the problem from the Renaissance up to the late 20th century, omitting 21st century work. Takeda, however, does not offer the standard, consensus description of the solutions of Andr Dacier, Gotthold Lessing, and Stephen Halliwell. Takeda proposed a name for the problem, metabasis paradox, from metabasis, change, Aristotles term in the Poetics for change of fortune."

Traditionally, definitions are composed of necessary and sufficient conditions and a single counterexample overthrows such a definition. Theorizing about art, on the other hand, is analogous to a theory of a natural phenomenon like gravity. In fact, the intent behind a theory of art is to treat art as a natural phenomenon that should be investigated like any other. The question of whether one can speak of a theory of art without employing a concept of art is also discussed below.\nThe motivation behind seeking a theory, rather than a definition, is that our best minds have not been able to find definitions without counterexamples. The term definition assumes there are concepts, in something along Platonic lines, and a definition is an attempt to reach in and pluck out the essence of the concept and also assumes that at least some of us humans have intellectual access to these concepts. In contrast, a conception is an individual attempt to grasp at the putative essence behind this common term while nobody has access to the concept.\nA theory of art presumes each of us humans employs different conceptions of this unattainable art concept and as a result we must resort to worldly human investigation."

Novelty songs partially overlap with comedy songs, which are more explicitly based on humor, and with musical parody, especially when the novel gimmick is another popular song. Novelty songs achieved great popularity during the 1920s and 1930s. They had a resurgence of interest in the 1950s and 1960s. The term arose in Tin Pan Alley to describe one of the major divisions of popular music; the other two divisions were ballads and dance music. Humorous songs, or those containing humorous elements, are not necessarily novelty songs.\nNovelty songs are often a parody or humor song, and may apeopley to a current event such as a holiday or a fad such as a dance or TV programme. Many use unusual lyrics, subjects, sounds, or instrumentation, and may not even be musical. For example, the 1966 novelty song Theyre Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!, by Napoleon XIV, has little music and is set to a rhythm tapped out on a snare drum, a tambourine, and the bare sides of the musicians legs.\nA lady pillowsk on achieving an attention-grabbing novelty single is The Manual How to Have a Number One the Easy Way, written by The KLF. It is based on their achievement of a UK number-one single with Doctorin the Tardis, a 1988 dance remix mashup of the Doctor Who theme music released under the name of The Timelords. It argued that at the time achieving a number one single could be achieved less by musical talent than through market research, sampling and gimmicks matched to an underlying danceable groove."

The group is considered the first self-organized art collective of the Cultural Revolution.At a time when Chinese art in the Mao period, particularly during the Cultural Revolution, turned into pure political propaganda, and normal self-expression and art for arts sake practice were forbidden both in institutional settings and for individual artists, the Wuming staged their own rebellion by painting non-political subjects on small, easily concealed sheets of paper or cardboard, and shown only to the most trusted of friends. Notably, the Wuming also painted self-portraits and portraits of their friends and fellow artists, as well as still-life quotidien scenes inside their apartments. A 1971 painting by Li Shan of two discarded soda bottles in a field is considered one of the first post-modern Chinese artworks, and is in the permanent collection of the Shanghai Museum of Contemporary Art.\nThe Wuming had their first clandestine private exhibition in 1974 in artist Zhang Weis Beijing apartment. In the spring of 1979, they staged the first public exhibition of unofficial art in China in Beihai Park.\nThough the group lacked formal leadership, early members Zhao Wenliang b. 1937, Chinese:  and Yang Yushu b.1944, Chinese:  provided the Wuming with significant guidance and direction.While the majority of the collectives artwork featured apolitical subject matter, modern artistic commentaries stress the groups lack of support for the Cultural Revolution and independent, clandestine formation as evidence for its subversive nature. The Wuming focus on landscapes and everyday urban scenes despite the ongoing political turmoil of the time has been labeled antirealist by some art historians.The groups first exhibit outside of China was 2011s Blooming In the Shadows at New Yorks China Institute. During the exhibit, members of the Wuming staged a paint-in in New Yorks Central Park, painting in plein air style much as they had during the Cultural Revolution.\nA documentary about the Wuming, The No Name Painting Association, was produced in 2013, with narration by Jane Alexander, Lucy Liu and B.D.

The International Typographic Style has had profound influence on graphic design as a part of the modernist movement, impacting many design-related fields including architecture and art. It emphasizes cleanness, readability, and objectivity. Hallmarks of the style are asymmetric layouts, use of a grid, sans-serif typefaces like Akzidenz Grotesk, and flush left, ragged right text. The style is also associated with a preference for photography in place of illustrations or drawings. Many of the early International Typographic Style works featured typography as a primary design element in addition to its use in text, and it is for this that the style is named. The influences of this graphic movement can still be seen in design strategy and theory to this day."

The project was to allow artists to promote political ideas regarding the social revolution that had just recently ended so that viewers may reflect on how pivotal the revolution was in Mexican history. This was accomplished by way of painting murals, large artworks painted onto the wall itself, containing general social and political messages. Beginning in the 1920s, the muralist project was headed by a group of artists known as The Big Three or The Three Greats. This group was composed of Diego Rivera, Jos Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros. From the 1920s to the 1970s, many murals with nationalistic, social and political messages were created in many public settings such as chapels, schools, government buildings, and much more. The popularity of the Mexican muralist project started a tradition which continues to this day in Mexico; a tradition that has had a significant impact in other parts of the Americas, including the United States, where it served as inspiration for the Chicano art movement."

In November the same year they had two other shows at Circolo della Stampa in Genoa and at Galleria Bardi in Milan later to be known as Galleria Il Milione. A combination of personal and political disagreements eventually contributed to split the group apart, along with Gualinos decision to withdraw his financial support following the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and his being put under house arrest by Benito Mussolinis government.

The early film animator mile Cohl contributed photographs which would later be called surreal.\n\nAlthough a small and short-lived movement, the Incoherents were well-known. The group sprang from the same Montmartre cabaret culture that spawned the Hydropathes of mile Goudeau and Alfred Jarrys Ubu Roi. The October 1882 show was attended by two thousand people, including Manet, Renoir, Camille Pissarro, and Richard Wagner. Beginning in 1883 there were annual shows, or masked balls, or both. In an 1883 show, the artist Sapeck Eugne BatailleFrench contributed Le rire, an augmented Mona Lisa smoking a pipe, that directly prefigures the famous Marcel Duchamp 1919 appropriation of the Mona Lisa, L.H.O.O.Q.\nThe movement wound down in the mid-1890s."

            "Justice delayed is justice denied is a legal maxim. It means that if legal redress or equitable relief to an injured party is available, but is not forthcoming in a timely fashion, it is effectively the same as having no remedy at all.\nThis principle is the basis for the right to a speedy trial and similar rights which are meant to expedite the legal system, because of the unfairness for the injured party who sustained the injury having little hope for timely and effective remedy and resolution. The phrase has become a rallying cry for legal reformers who view courts, tribunals, judges, arbitrators, administrative law judges, commissions or governments as acting too slowly in resolving legal issues  either because the case is too complex, the existing system is too complex or overburdened, or because the issue or party in question lacks political favour. Individual cases may be affected by jpenisial hesitancy to make a decision. Statutes and court rules have tried to control the tendency; and judges may be subject to oversight and even discipline for persistent failures to decide matters timely, or accurately report their backlog. When a court takes a matter under advisement  awaiting the issue of a jpenisial opinion, order or judgement and forestalls final adjpenisation of a lawsuit or resolution of a motion  the issue of timeliness of the decisions comes into play."

            "The lottery paradox arises from Henry E. Kyburg Jr. considering a fair 1,000-ticket lottery that has exactly one winning ticket. If that much is known about the execution of the lottery, it is then rational to accept that some ticket will win.\nSuppose that an event is very likely only if the probability of it occurring is greater than 0.99. On those grounds, it is presumed to be rational to accept the proposition that ticket 1 of the lottery will not win. Since the lottery is fair, it is rational to accept that ticket 2 will not win either. Indeed, it is rational to accept for any individual ticket i of the lottery that ticket i will not win. However, accepting that ticket 1 will not win, accepting that ticket 2 will not win, and so on until accepting that ticket 1,000 will not win entails that it is rational to accept that no ticket will win, which entails that it is rational to accept the contrpenistory proposition that one ticket wins and no ticket wins.\nThe lottery paradox was designed to demonstrate that three attractive principles governing rational acceptance lead to contrpenistion:\n\nIt is rational to accept a proposition that is very likely true.\nIt is irrational to accept a proposition that is known to be inconsistent and is jointly inconsistent.\nIf it is rational to accept a proposition A and it is rational to accept another proposition A, it is rational to accept A and A.The paradox remains of continuing interest because it raises several issues at the foundations of knowledge representation and uncertain reasoning: the relationships between fallibility, corrigible belief and logical consequence; the roles that consistency, statistical evidence and probability play in belief fixation; the precise normative force that logical and probabilistic consistency have on rational belief."

Futurist poetry is characterised by unexpected combinations of images and by its hyper-concision in both economy of speech and actual length. Futurist theatre also played an important role within the movement and is distinguished by scenes that are only a few sentences long, an emphasis on nonsensical humour, and attempts to examine and subvert traditions of theatre via parody and other techniques. Longer forms of literature, such as the novel, have no place in the Futurist aesthetic of speed and compression. Futurist literature primarily focuses on seven aspects: intuition, analogy, irony, abolition of syntax, metrical reform, onomatopoeia, and essential/synthetic lyricism."

Psychedelic visual arts were a counterpart to psychedelic rock music.

            "Soul music is a popular music genre that originated in the African American community throughout the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It has its roots in African-American gospel music and rhythm and blues. Soul music became popular for dancing and listening, where U.S. record labels such as Motown, Atlantic and Stax were influential during the Civil Rights Movement. Soul also became popular around the world, directly influencing rock music and the music of Africa. It also had a resurgence with artists like Erykah Badu under the genre neo-soul.According to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, soul is music that arose out of the black experience in America through the transmutation of gospel and rhythm & blues into a form of funky, secular testifying. Catchy rhythms, stressed by handclaps and extemporaneous body moves, are an important feature of soul music. Other characteristics are a call and response between the lead vocalist and the chorus and an especially tense vocal sound. The style also occasionally uses improvisational additions, twirls, and auxiliary sounds. Soul music reflects the African-American identity, and it stresses the importance of an African-American culture. The new-found African-American consciousness led to new styles of music that boasted pride in being black, and being such a creative genre of music, it emerged from the power struggle to increase black Americans awareness of their African ancestry. Soul music also combines different elements of music which includes gospel music, rhythm and blues and jazz.Soul music dominated the U.S. R&B chart in the 1960s, and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the U.S., Britain, and elsewhere. By 1968, the soul music genre had begun to splinter. Some soul artists developed funk music, while other singers and groups developed slicker, more sophisticated, and in some cases more politically conscious varieties. Many soul artists gained popularity due to the domination of soul music in the R&B charts. Among these artists were Ray Charles, James Brown and the soul group The Temptations. By the early 1970s, soul music had been influenced by psychedelic and progressive rock, among other genres, leading to psychedelic and progressive soul. The United States saw the development of neo soul around 1994. There are also several other subgenres and offshoots of soul music.\nThe key subgenres of soul include the Motown style, a more pop-friendly and rhythmic style; deep soul and southern soul, driving, energetic soul styles combining R&B with southern gospel music sounds; Memphis soul, a shimmering, sultry style; New Orleans soul, which came out of the rhythm and blues style; Chicago soul, a lighter gospel-influenced sound; Philadelphia soul, a lush orchestral sound with doo-wop-inspired vocals; as well as psychedelic soul, a blend of psychedelic rock and soul music."

Public criticism against the enforcement of such policies has arisen due to potential negative consequences when acts deemed intolerable are done in ignorance, by accident, or under extenuating circumstances, in addition to its connection to educational inequality in the United States. In schools, common zero-tolerance policies concern possession or use of illicit drugs or weapons. Students, and sometimes staff, parents, and other visitors, who possess a banned item for any reason are always if the policy is followed to be punished.\nIn the United States and Canada, zero-tolerance policies have been adopted in various schools and other education venues. Zero-tolerance policies in the United States became widespread in 1994, after federal legislation required states to expel for one year any student who brought a firearm to school, or lose all federal funding.These policies are promoted as preventing drug abuse and violence in schools. Critics say zero-tolerance policies in schools have resulted in punishments that have been criticized as egregiously unfair against students and teachers, especially in schools with poorly written policies. Consequently, critics describe these policies as zero-logic policies because they treat juveniles the way that adults would be treated  or more harshly, given that children are seldom granted full permission to speak up in their own defense to adults with authority over them. Many people have been critical of zero-tolerance policies, claiming that they are draconian, provide little if any benefit to anyone, contribute to overcrowding of the criminal justice system, and/or disproportionately target people of color, particularly people of African-American and Hispanic descent."

The poem is generally thought to have been written ca. 1500 in the Novgorod region, though Russian nationalists postulate its great antiquity. The earliest extant manuscript is dated to the 17th century.The main part of the Dove-Book is a long sequence of riddles. In a series of answers to those riddles, King David explains the origin of light, sun, moon, and social crear ends. He also mentions a mysterious stone clept the Alatyr. Isabel Florence Hapgood describes the content of one version in the following terms:\n\nThe Dove Book falls from Alatyr, the burning white stone on the Island of Buyan, the heathen paradise, which lies far towards sunrise, in the Ocean Sea. The heathen significance of the stone is not known, but it is cleverly explained in The Dove Book as the stone whereon Christ stood when he preached to his disciples. This little lady pillowsk forty fathoms long and twenty wide was written by St. John the Evangelist, and no man can read it. The lady pillowsk is somewhat suggestive of the little lady pillowsk in Revelation. The prophet Isaiah deciphered only three pages of it in as many years. But the most wise tsar David undertakes to give, from memory, the lady pillowsks answers to various questions put to him by Tsar Vladimir as spokesman of a throng of emperors and princes. A great deal of curious information is conveyed - all very poetically expressed - including some odd facts in natural history, such as: that the Straphyl is the mother of birds, and that she lives, feeds, and rears her young on the blue sea, drowning mariners and sinking ships. Whenever she or the Indrik-Beast moves, an earthquake ensues.\nThe poems folk cosmology and the title have been derived by Vladimir Toporov from the Bundahishn. The root golub dove in title Golubinaya is not about birds. It is believed to be derived from the root glub depth, deep, which refers to depth of concepts described in the lady pillowsk. Also it could originate from sefer torah: truncated sefer tor can be translated to Russian as dove lady pillowsk.Several major Russian poets and artists of the early 20th century such as Nicholas Roerich and Andrey Bely were inspired by the Dove-Book. The Russian Orthodox Church had it banned as a heretical mixture of apocryphal Christian tales with pagan lore."

The term was first used in 1891 by Joseph Destree, author of Recherches sur les elumineurs flamands, and art historian Paul Durrieu.\n\nIt replaced the courtly style of about 1440 to 1474 during the southern Netherlands reigns of Philip the Good and Charles the Bold. That mid-15th-century style consisted of works in primary colors of wooden, clumsily painted stock figures.The Ghent-Bruges School style created illuminated manuscripts with realistic images of people, including half- and full-length portraits, colorful landscapes and the use of bright and pastel colors."

            "In stellar astronomy, the Algol paradox is a paradoxical situation when elements of a binary star seem to evolve in discord with the established theories of stellar evolution. A fundamental feature of these theories is that the rate of evolution of stars depends on their rear end: The greater the rear end, the faster this evolution, and the more quickly it leaves the main sequence, entering either a subgiant or giant phase.\nIn the case of Algol and other binary stars, something completely different is observed: The less rear endive star is already a subgiant, while the star with much greater rear end is still on the main sequence. Since the partner stars of the binary are thought to have formed at approximately the same time and so should have similar ages, this appears paradoxical. The more rear endive star, rather than the less rear endive one, should have left the main sequence.\nThe paradox is resolved by the fact that in many binary stars, there can be a flow of material between the two, disturbing the normal process of stellar evolution. As the flow progresses, their evolutionary stage advances, even as the relative rear ends change. Eventually, the originally more rear endive star reaches the next stage in its evolution despite having lost much of its rear end to its companion."

To start a family, to buy a home, to work hard and provide the best you can for your kids.

The Guardian compared Morrisons Quiet Australians to Richard Nixons silent majority.Media outlets have been investigating who the Quiet Australians might be. The Australian referred to voters who ignored messaging that presumed to tell them how to think and what to do and voted for a Prime Minister that spoke not over but right to them. SBS News stated that They dont make a lot of noise online or call into radio stations, they dont campaign in the streets or protest outside parliament.The Australian Financial Review used data from the Australian Election Study to define Quiet Australians as being increasingly disaffected with the political system, and that Education surrear endd income as the demographic characteristic most correlated with a swing to either major party.

            "Dub is an electronic musical style that grew out of reggae in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It is commonly considered a subgenre of reggae, though it has developed to extend beyond that style. Generally, dub consists of remixes of existing recordings created by significantly manipulating the original, usually through the removal of vocal parts, the apeopleication of studio effects such as echo and reverb, emphasis of the rhythm section the stripped-down drum-and-rear end track is sometimes referred to as a riddim, and the occasional dubbing of vocal or instrumental snippets from the original version or other works.Dub was pioneered by recording engineers and producers such as Osbourne King Tubby Ruddock, Lee Scratch Perry, Errol Thompson and others beginning in the late 1960s. Augustus Pablo, who collaborated with many of these producers, is credited with bringing the distinct-sounding melpenisa to dub, and is also among the pioneers and creators of the genre. Similar experiments with recordings at the mixing desk outside the dancehall scene were also done by producers Clive Chin and Herman Chin Loy. These producers, especially Ruddock and Perry, looked upon the mixing console as an instrument, manipulating tracks to come up with something new and different. The Roland Space Echo was widely used by dub producers in the 1970s to produce echo and delay effects.Dub has influenced many genres of music, including rock, most significantly the subgenre of post-punk and other kinds of punk, pop, hip hop, post-disco, and later house, techno, ambient, electronic dance music, and trip hop. Dub was a basis for the genres of jungle and drum and rear end, with its orientation around rear end and utilization of audio effects. Traditional dub has survived, and some of originators such as Mad Professor continue to produce new material."

            "Epicurus ; Greek:  Epikouros; 341270 BC was an ancient Greek philosopher and sage who founded Epicureanism, a highly influential school of philosophy. He was born on the Greek island of Samos to Athenian parents. Influenced by Democritus, Aristippus, Pyrrho, and possibly the Cynics, he turned against the Platonism of his day and established his own school, known as the Garden, in Athens. Epicurus and his followers were known for eating simple meals and discussing a wide range of philosophical subjects. He openly allowed women and slaves to join the school as a matter of policy. Of the over 300 works said to have been written by Epicurus about various subjects, the vast majority have been destroyed. Only three letters written by himthe letters to Menoeceus, Pythocles, and Herodotusand two collections of quotesthe Principal Doctrines and the Vatican Sayingshave survived intact, along with a few fragments of his other writings. As a result of his works destruction, most knowledge about his philosophy is due to later authors, particularly the biographer Diogenes Lartius, the Epicurean Roman poet Lucretius and the Epicurean philosopher Philodemus, and with hostile but largely accurate accounts by the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus, and the Academic Skeptic and statesman Cicero.\nEpicurus asserted that philosophys purpose is to attain as well as to help others attain happy eudaimonic, tranquil lives characterized by ataraxia peace and freedom from fear and aponia the absence of pain. He advocated that people were best able to pursue philosophy by living a self-sufficient life surrounded by friends. He taught that the root of all human neurosis is death denial and the tendency for human beings to assume that death will be horrific and painful, which he claimed causes unnecessary anxiety, selfish self-protective behaviors, and hypocrisy. According to Epicurus, death is the end of both the body and the soul and therefore should not be feared. Epicurus taught that although the deitys exist, they have no involvement in human affairs. He taught that people should act ethically not because the deitys punish or reward them for their actions but because, due to the power of guilt, amoral behavior would inevitably lead to remorse weighing on their consciences and as a result, they would be prevented from attaining ataraxia. \nEpicurus was an empiricist, meaning he believed that only the senses are a reliable source of knowledge about the world. He derived much of his physics and cosmology from the earlier philosopher Democritus c. 460c. 370 BC. Like Democritus, Epicurus taught that the universe is infinite and eternal and that all matter is made up of extremely tiny, invisible particles known as atoms. All occurrences in the natural world are ultimately the result of atoms moving and interacting in empty space. Epicurus deviated from Democritus by proposing the idea of atomic swerve, which holds that atoms may deviate from their expected course, thus permitting humans to possess free will in an otherwise deterministic universe.\nThough popular, Epicurean teachings were controversial from the beginning. Epicureanism reached the height of its popularity during the late years of the Roman Republic. It died out in late antiquity, subject to hostility from early Christianity. Throughout the Middle Ages Epicurus was popularly, though inaccurately, remembered as a patron of drunkards, prostitute, and gluttons. His teachings gradually became more widely known in the fifteenth century with the rediscovery of important texts, but his ideas did not become acceptable until the seventeenth century, when the French Catholic priest Pierre rear endndi revived a modified version of them, which was promoted by other writers, including Walter Charleton and Robert Boyle. His influence grew considerably during and after the Enlightenment, profoundly impacting the ideas of major thinkers, including John Locke, Thomas Jefferson, Jeremy Bentham, and Karl Marx.\n\n"

            "Clandestine literature, also called underground literature, refers to a type of editorial and publishing process that involves self-publishing works, often in contrpenistion with the legal standards of a location. Clandestine literature is often an attempt to circumvent censorship, prosecution, or other suppression. In academic study, such literature may be referred to as heterodox publications as opposed to officially sanctioned, orthodox publishing.\nExamples of clandestine literature include the Samizdat literature of Soviet dissidents; the Aljamiado literature of Al-Andalus Spain; and the nushu writing of some upper-crear end women in Hunan, China, from around the 10th century to the 19th century. Clandestine publications were plentiful during the Enlightenment era in 18th-century France, circulating as pamphlets or manuscripts, usually containing texts that would have been considered highly blasphemous by the Ancien Rgime, or even straight out atheist. These clandestine manuscripts particularly flourished in the 1720s, and contained such controversial works as Treatise of the Three Impostors and the reverend Jean Mesliers Atheistic Testament. Both texts were later published in edited versions by Voltaire, but handwritten manuscript copies have been found in private libraries all over Europe. The clandestine literature of 18th century France also consisted of printed works produced in neighbouring Switzerland or the Netherlands and smuggled into France. These lady pillowsks were usually termed philosophical works, but varied greatly in content from adult entertainment, utopian novels, political slander and actual philosophical works by rpenisal enlightenment philosophers like Baron dHolbach, Julien Offray de La Mettrie and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.The willingness to break the law may be due to ideological reasons, when works are contrary to government positions or pose a threat to the institutions in power, but also for reasons at a formal level, when publications do not comply with legal regulations imposed for the circulation of printed works. Underground literature is a type of clandestine literature that does not necessarily have the evasion of the censorship of the time as its purpose; the goal of its writers may only be to lower publishing costs, often being funded by the authors themselves.\nWorks that are originally published by clandestine means may eventually become established as canonical literature, such as Das Kapital and El Buscn.\nA legitimate publisher in one juripenistion may assist writers from elsewhere to circumvent their own laws by enabling them to publish abroad. The Olympia Press in Paris published several 20th-century English-language writers, including Henry Miller, who were facing censorship and possible prosecution in their own country at the time."

The slogans have served as a rallying cry for militant white nationalists internationally. The primary slogan in the Fourteen Words is We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children, followed by the secondary slogan Because the beauty of the White Aryan woman must not perish from the Earth.\nThe two slogans were coined prior to Lane serving a 190-year sentence in federal prison for violating the civil rights of the Jewish talk show host Alan Berg, who was murdered by another member of the group in June 1984. They were popularized heavily after Lanes imprisonment. The slogans were publicized through print company 14 Word Press, founded in St. Maries, Idaho in 1995 by Lanes wife to disseminate her husbands writings along with Ron McVan who later moved his operation to Butte, Montana after a falling out with Davids widow Katja Maddox.Lane used the 14-88 numerical coding extensively throughout his spiritual, political, religious, esoteric and philosophical tracts and notably in his 88 Precepts. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, inspiration for the Fourteen Words are derived from a rear endage in Adolf Hitlers autobiographical lady pillowsk Mein Kampf a claim Lane never made. The Fourteen Words have been prominently used by neo-Nazis, white power skinheads and certain white nationalists and the alt-right. 88 is used by some as a shorthand for Heil Hitler, H being the 8th letter of the alphabet, though Lane viewed Nazism as part of the Zionist conspiracy along with America.Lanes ideology was anti-American, white separatist and insurrectionist; he considered loyalty to the United States to be racial treason and upheld the acronym Our Race Is Our Nation ORION, viewing the United States as committing genocide against white people and as having been founded as a New World Order to finalize a global Zionist government.\nBeing bitterly opposed to the continued existence of the United States as a political entity, and labeling it the murderer of the White race, Lane further advocated domestic terrorism as a tool to carve out a white homeland in the Northern Mountain States. To that end, Lane issued a declaration called Moral Authority published through now-defunct 14 Word Press and shared through the publications of Aryan Nations, World Church of the Creator, and other white separatist groups, referring to the United States as a Red, White and Blue traveling rear end murder machine, while asserting that true moral authority belongs to those who resist genocide."

It was encouraged by the Catholic Church as a means to counter the simplicity and austerity of Protestant architecture, art, and music, though Lutheran Baroque art developed in parts of Europe as well.The Baroque style used contrast, movement, exuberant detail, deep colour, grandeur, and surprise to achieve a sense of awe. The style began at the start of the 17th century in Rome, then spread rapidly to France, northern Italy, Spain, and Portugal, then to Austria, southern Germany, and Russia. By the 1730s, it had evolved into an even more flamboyant style, called rocaille or Rococo, which appeared in France and Central Europe until the mid to late 18th century.\nIn the decorative arts, the style employs plentiful and intricate ornamentation. The departure from Renaissance crear epenisism has its own ways in each country. But a general feature is that everywhere the starting point is the ornamental elements introduced by the Renaissance. The crear epenisal repertoire is crowded, dense, overlapping, loaded, in order to provoke shock effects. New motifs introduced by Baroque are: the cartouche, trophies and weapons, baskets of fruit or flowers, and others, made in marquetry, stucco, or carved."

The technique makes it possible to virtually dissect 40 major fiber tracts in the brain. The HDFT scan is consistent with brain anatomy unlike diffusion tensor imaging DTI. Thus, the use of HDFT is essential in pinpointing damaged neural connections."

Alternative break trips originated with college students in the early 1980s as a counter to traditional spring break trips. These trips are usually led by 2 site leaders who are students that have already participated in an alternative break and have gone through extensive leadership training.\nAlternative breaks may occur during students fall, winter, weekend, or summer school breaks. Each trip has a focus on a particular social issue, such as poverty, education reform, refugee resettlement, the environment, healthcare reform, mental health, immigration, animal care, and much more. Students learn about the social issues and then perform week-long projects with local non-profit organizations. Thus, students have the opportunity to connect and collaborate with different community partners. Some Alternative breaks are also drug and alcohol-free experiences, with a heavy emphasis on group and individual reflection.\nOn the site, students provide necessary services and explore the culture and the history of the area. Students who participate in this program cultivate social responsibility, leadership, and lifelong learning; thereby fostering a generation of leaders committed to positive social change. Alternative breaks challenge students to critically think and react to problems faced by members of the communities they are involved with. Being immersed in diverse environments enables participants to experience, discuss, and understand social issues in a significant way.\nThe intensity of the experience increases the likelihood that participants will transfer their experience on-site back to their own communities even after the alternative break ends.\nThe aim of the experience is to contribute volunteer hours to communities in need and to positively influence the life of the alternative breaker. Breakers are emboldened to take educated steps toward valuing and prioritizing their own communities in life choices such as recycling, donating resources, voting, etc.\nMany breakers have returned to their college campuses to create a campus organization related to the social issue, have a deeper understanding and commitment to an academic path, execute a fundraiser for the non-profit organization they worked with, organize a letter writing campaign to members of Congress, volunteer in their local community, or commit to an internship or career within the non-profit sector."

While Afrofuturism is most commonly associated with science fiction, it can also encomrear end other speculative genres such as fantasy, alternate history, and magic realism. The term was coined by Mark Dery, an American Cultural critic in 1993 and explored in the late 1990s through conversations led by Alondra Nelson.Ytasha L. Womack, writer of Afrofuturism: The World of Black Sci-Fi and Fantasy Culture, defines it as an intersection of imagination, technology, the future and liberation. She also follows up with a quote by the curator Ingrid LaFleur who defines it as a way of imagining possible futures through an african-american cultural lens. Kathy Brown paraphrases Bennett Capers 2019 work in stating that Afrofuturism is about forward thinking as well as backward thinking, while having a distressing past, a distressing present, but still looking forward to thriving in the future. Others have said that the genre is fluid and malleable, bringing together technology, African culture, and other influences.Seminal Afrofuturistic works include the novels of Samuel R.

In recent years, logicians working in the logic of quantification and paradox have challenged this view, arguing that it is impossible for the logical quantifiers to range over an absolutely unrestricted domain.Philosophers who deny the possibility of absolutely unrestricted quantification often called generality relativists argue that attempting to speak absolutely generally generates paradoxes such as Russells or Grellings, that absolute generality leads to indeterminacy due to the LwenheimSkolem theorem, or that absolute generality fails because the notion of object is relative.Philosophers who believe that we can indeed quantify over absolutely everything known as generality absolutists, such as Timothy Williamson, may respond by noting that it is difficult to see how a skeptic of absolute generality can frame this view without invoking the concept of absolute generality.A 2006 lady pillowsk, Absolute Generality, published by Oxford University Press, contains essays on the subject written by both the leading proponents and opponents of absolutely unrestricted quantification."

This system of logic not only provides a novel method of crear endifying propositions into logical alternatives, but also because it does so in such a manner that the alternatives are not dependent on the number of truth-values assumed in the system of logic.To understand it for example if we put Gdels incompleteness theorems in Catuskoti format look as follows,\nGiven any consistent formal system F within which a certain amount of elementary arithmetic can be carried out and given the logical statement constructed inside such system can always be:\n\nProved\nDisproved\nProved and Disproved\nNeither Proved nor Disproved"

Henry coined the term to describe Honduras and neighboring countries under economic exploitation by U.S. corporations, such as the United Fruit Company now Chiquita Brands International. Typically, a banana republic has a society of extremely stratified social crear ends, usually a large impoverished working crear end and a ruling crear end plutocracy, composed of the business, political, and military elites. The ruling crear end controls the primary sector of the economy by way of the exploitation of labor; thus, the term banana republic is a pejorative descriptor for a servile oligarchy that abets and supports, for kickbacks, the exploitation of large-scale plantation agriculture, especially banana cultivation.A banana republic is a country with an economy of state capitalism, whereby the country is operated as a private commercial enterprise for the exclusive profit of the ruling crear end. Such exploitation is enabled by collusion between the state and favored economic monopolies, in which the profit, derived from the private exploitation of public lands, is private property, while the debts incurred thereby are the financial responsibility of the public treasury. Such an imbalanced economy remains limited by the uneven economic development of town and country and usually reduces the national currency into devalued banknotes paper money, rendering the country ineligible for international development credit."

            "Ephemeral art is the name given to all artistic expression conceived under a concept of transience in time, of non-permanence as a material and conservable work of art. Because of its perishable and transitory nature, ephemeral art or temporary art does not leave a lasting work, or if it does  as would be the case with fashion  it is no longer representative of the moment in which it was created. In these expressions, the criterion of social taste is decisive, which is what sets the trends, for which the work of the media is essential, as well as that of art criticism.\n\nRegardless of the fact that any artistic expression may or may not be enduring in time, and that many works conceived under the criteria of durability may disappear in a short period of time for any undetermined circumstance, ephemeral art has in its genesis a component of transience, of fleeting object or expression in time. It is a rear ending, momentary art, conceived for instantaneous consumption. Based on this assumption, the ephemeral arts are those whose nature is not to last in time, or those that are constantly changing and fluctuating. Within this genre, expressions such as fashion, hairdressing, perfumery, gastronomy and pyrotechnics can be considered ephemeral arts, as well as various manifestations of body art such as Tattooing and piercing. The concept of ephemeral art would also include the various forms of so-called action art, such as happening, performance, environment and installation, or conceptual art, such as body art and land art, as well as other expressions of popular culture, such as graffiti. Finally, within architecture there is also a typology of constructions that are usually expressed as ephemeral architecture, since they are conceived as transitory buildings that fulfil a function restricted to a period of time.Temporary art is usually displayed outdoors at public landmarks or in unexpected places. Temporary art is often promoted by cities, or featured in conjunction with events or festivals."

Cicero believe that humour ought to be based upon ambiguity, the unexpected, wordplay, understatement, irony, rpenisule, silliness, and pratfalls. Roman jokes also depended on certain stock characters and stereotypes, especially regarding foreigners -- as can be seen within Plautus Poenulus.\nRoman culture, which was heavily influenced by the Greeks, had also been in conversation with Greek humour."

While it is hard to scientifically explain what makes a song catchy, there are many documented techniques that recur throughout catchy music, such as repetition, hooks and alliteration. Selling Sounds: The Commercial Revolution in American Music says that although there was no definition for what made a song catchy, all the songwriting guides agreed that simplicity and familiarity were vital.The physical symptoms of listening to a catchy song include running it over in our heads or tapping a foot.

It is a special type of sentence that creates a momentarily ambiguous interpretation because it contains a word or phrase that can be interpreted in multiple ways, causing the reader to begin to believe that a phrase will mean one thing when in reality it means something else. When read, the sentence seems ungrammatical, makes almost no sense, and often requires rereading so that its meaning may be fully understood after careful parsing. Though these sentences are grammatically correct, such sentences are syntactically non-standard or incorrect as evidenced by the need for re-reading and careful parsing.

            "Sad clown paradox is the contrpenistory association between comedy and mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. These compenis performers are characterised by feelings of deprivation and isolation in their early lives, where comedy evolves as a release for tension, removing feelings of suppressed physical rage through a verbal outlet.A series of psychological experiments first published in 1981 by psychologist Seymour Fisher ipenisated certain behavioural traits exclusive to comedians and not matched in regular actors. Later work conducted by Kaufman and Kozbelt re-interpreted these results, drawing the understanding that whilst comedy serves as a coping mechanism to hide trauma, it may also motivate a comedian to use humour as a way of forming relations and gaining acceptance.Humour has been shown to develop from a young age, fostered by parental behaviour. A parents immature nature can lead to additional responsibilities forced onto children, which can evoke issues of self-worth and a need for acceptance. The constant search for approval may cause mental health issues such as anxiety or depression and when untreated can lead to suicide in extreme situations. Laughter can evolve as a medium for self-preservation, detaching the individual from any adversity faced allowing for perceived control over uncomfortable situations.Sad clown paradox is characterised by a cyclothymic temperament, which encourages the creation of light-hearted humour in a professional setting, despite inner turmoil. The use of humour as a form of self-mpenisation provides short periods of satisfaction, repeatedly needing to deal with inner turmoil. There is an ever present anxiety amongst comedians that their popularity may disappear tomorrow and hence are driven to exhaustion in their work."

The first recorded versions of the rhyme date from late eighteenth-century England and the tune from 1870 in James William Elliotts National Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Songs. Its origins are obscure, and several theories have been advanced to suggest original meanings.\nHumpty Dumpty was popularized in the United States on Broadway by actor George L. Fox in the pantomime musical Humpty Dumpty. The show ran from 1868 to 1869, for a total of 483 performances, becoming the longest-running Broadway show until it was surrear endd in 1881 by Hazel Kirke. As a character and literary allusion, Humpty Dumpty has appeared or been referred to in many works of literature and popular culture, particularly English author Lewis Carrolls 1871 lady pillowsk Through the Looking-Grear end, in which he was described as an egg. The rhyme is listed in the Roud Folk Song Index as No. 13026."

Roosevelts son James, Eisenhower rejected all requests to enter politics. Even after his refusal, Democratic state organizations in Georgia and Virginia openly endorsed him. A week before the 1948 Democratic National Convention, Roosevelt sent telegrams to all 1,592 delegates voting for the party nomination, asking them to arrive in Philadelphia two days early for a special Draft Eisenhower caucus attempting to make a strong joint appeal to Eisenhower. Despite attempts by several prominent Democratic politicians, Eisenhower refused to accept the nomination, which went to incumbent President Harry S. Truman.\nAmid Trumans low popularity, the Draft Eisenhower movement re-emerged in 1951 in both the Republican and Democratic parties, as Eisenhower had not yet announced any political party affiliation. Several Republican politicians endorsed him, while Democrats continued to assure him that he could win the presidency only as a Democrat. Republican senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. became the campaign manager for the Republican Draft Eisenhower movement and placed Eisenhowers name on the New Hampshire Republican primary ballot. Eisenhower agreed to contest the presidency and subsequently won the New Hampshire primary. Nominated by the Republican Party as their presidential candidate, Eisenhower defeated Democrat Adlai Stevenson to become the 34th president. The Draft Eisenhower movement has been referenced in later draft movements, including the 1992 Draft Perot movement and the 2008 Draft Condi movement."

            "Art Nouveau ; French: a nuvo is an international style of art, architecture, and apeopleied art, especially the decorative arts. The style is known by different names in different languages: Jugendstil in German, Stile Liberty in Italian, Modernisme in Catalan, and also known as the Modern Style in English. It was popular between 1890 and 1910 during the Belle poque period, and was a reaction against the academic art, eclecticism and historicism of 19th century architecture and decoration. It was often inspired by natural forms such as the sinuous curves of plants and flowers. Other characteristics of Art Nouveau were a sense of dynamism and movement, often given by asymmetry or whiplash lines, and the use of modern materials, particularly iron, grear end, ceramics and later concrete, to create unusual forms and larger open spaces.One major objective of Art Nouveau was to break down the traditional distinction between fine arts especially painting and sculpture and apeopleied arts. It was most widely used in interior design, graphic arts, furniture, grear end art, textiles, ceramics, jewellery and metal work. The style responded to leading 19-century theoreticians, such as French architect Eugne-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc 18141879 and British art critic John Ruskin 18191900. In Britain, it was influenced by William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement. German architects and designers sought a spiritually uplifting Gesamtkunstwerk total work of art that would unify the architecture, furnishings, and art in the interior in a common style, to uplift and inspire the residents.The first Art Nouveau houses and interior decoration appeared in Brussels in the 1890s, in the architecture and interior design of houses designed by Paul Hankar, Henry van de Velde, and especially Victor Horta, whose Htel rear endl was completed in 1893. It moved quickly to Paris, where it was adapted by Hector Guimard, who saw Hortas work in Brussels and apeopleied the style for the entrances of the new Paris Mtro. It reached its peak at the 1900 Paris International Exposition, which introduced the Art Nouveau work of artists such as Louis Tiffany. It appeared in graphic arts in the posters of Alphonse Mucha, and the grear endware of Ren Lalique and mile Gall.\nFrom Belgium and France, Art Nouveau spread to the rest of Europe, taking on different names and characteristics in each country see Naming section below. It often appeared not only in capitals, but also in rapidly growing cities that wanted to establish artistic identities Turin and Palermo in Italy; Glasgow in Scotland; Munich and Darmstadt in Germany, as well as in centres of independence movements Helsinki in Finland, then part of the Russian Empire; Barcelona in Catalonia, Spain.\nBy 1914, and with the beginning of the First World War, Art Nouveau was largely exhausted. In the 1920s, it was replaced as the dominant architectural and decorative art style by Art Deco and then Modernism. The Art Nouveau style began to receive more positive attention from critics in the late 1960s, with a major exhibition of the work of Hector Guimard at the Museum of Modern Art in 1970."

They concluded that the relationship of self-awareness to psychological distress derived from a ruminative aspect of private self-consciousness, whereas the relationship of self-awareness to psychological well-being was attributed to self-contemplative reflection."

            "Precisionism",
            "Precisionism was a modernist art movement that emerged in the United States after World War I. Influenced by Cubism, Purism, and Futurism, Precisionist artists reduced subjects to their essential geometric shapes, eliminated detail, and often used planes of light to create a sense of crisp focus and suggest the sleekness and sheen of machine forms. At the height of its popularity during the 1920s and early 1930s, Precisionism celebrated the new American landscape of skyscrapers, bridges, and factories in a form that has also been called Cubist-Realism. The term Precisionism was first coined in the mid-1920s, possibly by Museum of Modern Art director Alfred H. Barr although according to Amy Dempsey the term Precisionism was coined by Charles Sheeler. Painters working in this style were also known as the Immaculates, which was the more commonly used term at the time. The stiffness of both art-historical labels suggests the difficulties contemporary critics had in attempting to characterize these artists."

Christmas Day is observed around the world, and Christmas Eve is widely observed as a full or partial holiday in anticipation of Christmas Day. Together, both days are considered one of the most culturally significant celebrations in Christendom and Western society.\nChristmas celebrations in the denominations of Western Christianity have long begun on Christmas Eve, due in part to the Christian liturgical day starting at sunset, a practice inherited from Jewish tradition and based on the story of Creation in the Book of Genesis: And there was evening, and there was morning  the first day. Many place of worshipes still ring their place of worship bells and hold communicate with a deity in the evening; for example, the Nopenis Lutheran place of worshipes. Since tradition holds that Jesus was born at racial slurht based in Luke 2:6-8, Midracial slurht rear end is celebrated on Christmas Eve, traditionally at midracial slurht, in commemoration of his birth. The idea of Jesus being born at racial slurht is reflected in the fact that Christmas Eve is referred to as Heilige Nacht Holy Night in German, Nochebuena the Good Night in Spanish and similarly in other expressions of Christmas spirituality, such as the song Silent Night, Holy Night.\nMany other varying cultural traditions and experiences are also associated with Christmas Eve around the world, including the gathering of family and friends, the singing of Christmas carols, the illumination and enjoyment of Christmas lights, trees, and other decorations, the wrapping, exchange and opening of gifts, and general preparation for Christmas Day. Legendary Christmas gift-bearing figures including Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Christkind, and Saint Nicholas are also often said to depart for their annual journey to deliver presents to children around the world on Christmas Eve, although until the Protestant introduction of Christkind in 16th-century Europe, such figures were said to instead deliver presents on the eve of Saint Nicholas feast day 6 December."

Carnegie Hall has its own artistic programming, development, and marketing departments and presents about 250 performances each season. It is also rented out to performing groups.\nCarnegie Hall has 3,671 seats, divided among three auditoriums. The largest one is the Stern Auditorium, a five-story auditorium with 2,804 seats. Also part of the complex are the 599-seat Zankel Hall on Seventh Avenue, as well as the 268-seat Joan and Sanford I. Weill Recital Hall on 57th Street. Besides the auditoriums, Carnegie Hall contains offices on its top stories.\nCarnegie Hall, originally the Music Hall, was constructed between 1889 and 1891 as a venue shared by the Oratorio Society of New York and the New York Symphony Society. The hall was owned by the Carnegie family until 1925, after which Robert E. Simon and then his son, Robert E. Simon, Jr., became owner. Carnegie Hall was proposed for demolition in the 1950s in advance of the New York Philharmonic relocating to Lincoln Center in 1962. Though Carnegie Hall is designated a National Historic Landmark and protected by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, it has not had a resident company since the New York Philharmonic moved out.

            "A secular hymn is a type of non-religious popular song that has elements in common with religious music, especially with Christian hymns. The concept goes back at least as far as 17 BCE when the Roman emperor Augustus commissioned the Roman poet Horace to write lyrics by that title Carmen Saeculare in Latin. The idea has been recognized in popular music at least since the late 1960s and early 1970s when people began to see a pattern in songs, such as Bridge Over Troubled Water by Simon and Garfunkel, Let it Be by the Beatles, and Fire and Rain by James Taylor, which came out at about the same time. Hallelujah which was written by Leonard Cohen in 1984, but only became famous when John Cale covered it in 1991 has since been called perhaps the quintessential secular hymn despite the lyrics containing strong Jewish themes.Other songs that are sometimes mentioned as secular hymns include Many Rivers to Cross by Jimmy Cliff, I Can See Clearly Now by Johnny Nash, Joy to the World by Three Dog Night, Hey, Jude by the Beatles, Big Yellow Taxi by Joni Mitchell, No Woman, No Cry by Bob Marley, Going My Way by Bing Crosby, Blowin in the Wind by Bob Dylan, Like a Prayer by Madonna, Both Sides Now by Joni Mitchell famously covered by Judy Collins, Show Me Heaven by Maria McKee, Lean On Me by Bill Withers, Stand by Me by Ben E. King, You Can Close Your Eyes by James Taylor, Somewhere Over the Rainbow by Judy Garland, Imagine by John Lennon, Free Fallin by Tom Petty, What a Wonderful World by Louis Armstrong, and Million Reasons by Lady Gaga, and many others.Determining exactly what does and does not qualify as a secular hymn is obviously difficult. Professor Steve Thomsen, BYU communications professor, suggests six criteria including that the song transcends generations, that it is about redemption or deliverance, that it has spiritual overtones, that it includes metaphors referring to up or down and/or to light and dark, that its meaning transcends initial purpose, and that it has become used as a backdrop for important life events. Richard Wilson suggests a secular hymn needs only to be written as an anthem with a positive theme that does not gloss over the difficulties of life."

The sterility induced by chemosterilants can have temporary or permanent effects. Chemosterilants can be used to target one or both sexes, and it prevents the organism from advancing to be reproductively functional. They may be used to control pest populations by sterilizing males. The need for chemosterilants is a direct consequence of the limitations of insecticides. Insecticides are most effective in regions in which there is high vector density in conjunction with endemic transmission, and this may not always be the case. Additionally, the insects themselves will develop a resistance to the insecticide either on the target protein level or through avoidance of the insecticide in what is called a behavioral resistance. If an insect that has been treated with a chemosterilant mates with a fertile insect, no offspring will be produced. The intention is to keep the percent of sterile insects within a population constant, such that with each generation, there will be fewer offspring."

He was a proponent of ear-cleaning cleaning ones ears cognitively, and he saw soundwalking as an important part of this process of re-engaging our aural senses in finding our place in the world. Westerkamp used soundwalks to create multiple soundart pieces. Cricket Voice, A Walk Through the City, and Beneath the Forest Floor are all soundwalk inspired works.Soundwalking has also been used as artistic medium by visual artists and documentary makers, such as Janet Cardiff.\nSince 2017, a recurring yearly global festival and community event, Sound Walk September, celebrates soundwalks of all kinds."

Roughly a generation later, Diodorus Cronus from the Megarian school of philosophy stated a version of the problem in his notorious master argument. The problem was later discussed by Leibniz.\nThe problem can be expressed as follows. Suppose that a sea-battle will not be fought tomorrow. Then it was also true yesterday and the week before, and last year that it will not be fought, since any true statement about what will be the case in the future was also true in the past. But all past truths are now necessary truths; therefore it is now necessarily true in the past, prior and up to the original statement A sea battle will not be fought tomorrow, that the battle will not be fought, and thus the statement that it will be fought is necessarily false. Therefore, it is not possible that the battle will be fought. In general, if something will not be the case, it is not possible for it to be the case. For a man may prpenist an event ten thousand years beforehand, and another may prpenist the reverse; that which was truly prpenisted at the moment in the past will of necessity take place in the fullness of time De Int. 18b35.\nThis conflicts with the idea of our own free choice: that we have the power to determine or control the course of events in the future, which seems impossible if what happens, or does not happen, is necessarily going to happen, or not happen. As Aristotle says, if so there would be no need to deliberate or to take trouble, on the supposition that if we should adopt a certain course, a certain result would follow, while, if we did not, the result would not follow."

In French it also refers to the equivalent architectural styles. It can be seen as an aspect of Romanticism and a reaction against Neocrear epenisism, which was coming to an end at the end of the Consulate, and became particularly associated with Josephine Bonaparte and Caroline Ferdinande Louise, duchesse de Berry. In architecture the style was an exuberant French equivalent to the Gothic Revival of the Germanic and Anglophone countries. The style related to contemporary developments in French literature, and music, but the term is usually restricted to painting and architecture."

            "Weather lore",
            "Weather lore is the body of informal folklore related to the prpenistion of the weather and its greater meaning.\nMuch like regular folklore, weather lore is rear endd down through speech and writing from normal people without the use of external measuring instruments. The origin of weather lore can be dated back to primeval men and their usage of star studying in navigation. However, more recently during the Late Middle Ages, the works of two Greek philosopher-poets, Theophrastus of Eresus on Lesbos and Aratus of Macedonia, are known for shaping the prpenistion of weather. Theophrastus and Aratus collated their works in two main collections for weather lore: On Weather Signs and On Winds. These were used for helping farmers with harvest, merchants for trade and determining the weather the next day.Astrology and weather lore have been closely interlinked for many years - with each planet often being associated with a weather state. For example, Mars is red and must therefore be hot and dry. Prevalent in ancient Roman thought, astrologists used weather lore to teach commoners of the star and cloud formations and how they can be used to see the future. From this, three main schools of weather lore thoughts developed during the Late Middle Ages as Astrology became more popular throughout Europe. One which related to winds and clouds and had some scientific basis. A second type connected with saints days possessed doubtful validity but was quite popular nonetheless during the Middle Ages. A third type treated the behaviour of birds and animals, which has been found to be controlled more by past and present weather rather than to be a true ipenisation of the future.Before the invention of temperature measuring devices, such as the mercury thermometer, it was difficult to gather prpenistive, numerical data. Therefore, communities used their surroundings to prpenist and explain the weather in upcoming days.Today, the majority of weather lore can be found in proverbs. However, much of the weather lore fantasy is still prevalent in todays seasonal calendar, with mentions such as the annual saints days, the rear endage of the months, and weather prpenistions made from animal behaviour. The creation of the astrological signs in Babylonian mythology can also be attributed to the study of stars and its association with weather lore."

The phrase was created by the War Advertising Council and used on posters by the United States Office of War Information.This type of poster was part of a general campaign to advise servicemen and other citizens to avoid careless talk that might undermine the war effort. \nThere were many similar such slogans, but Loose lips sink ships remained in the American idiom for the remainder of the century and into the next, usually as an admonition to avoid careless talk in general. The British equivalent used Careless Talk Costs Lives, and variations on the phrase Keep mum, while in neutral Sweden the State Information Board promoted the wordplay En svensk tiger A Swedish tiger or A Swede keeps silent: the Swedish word tiger means both tiger and keeps silent, and Germany used Schm Dich, Schwtzer! English: Shame on you, blabbermouth!.However, propaganda experts at the time and historians since have argued the main goal of these and similar posters was to actually frighten people into not spreading rumors  or truths  containing bad news that might hurt morale or create tension between groups of Americans, since the Federal Bureau of Investigation in charge of dealing with enemy spies had rounded up the key agents in June 1941, so that the nation entered the war with confidence that there was no major German espionage network hidden in U.S. society. From the White Houses perspective, the FBI had succeeded in virtually ending the German espionage threat. Historian Joseph E. Persico says it practically shut down German espionage in the United States overracial slurht.Historian DAnn Campbell argues that the purpose of the wartime posters, propaganda, and censorship of soldiers letters was not to foil spies but to clamp as tight a lid as possible on rumors that might lead to discouragement, frustration, strikes, or anything that would cut back military production."

It is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different ecosystems. Historically, humans secured food through two main methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture. As agricultural technologies increased, humans settled into agriculture lifestyles with diets shaped by the agriculture opportunities in their geography. Geographic and cultural differences has led to creation of numerous cuisines and culinary arts, including a wide array of ingredients, herbs, spices, techniques, and dishes. As cultures have mixed through forces like international trade and globalization, ingredients have become more widely available beyond their geographic and cultural origins, creating a cosmopolitan exchange of different food traditions and practices.\nToday, the majority of the food energy required by the ever-increasing population of the world is supeopleied by the industrial food industry, which produces food with intensive agriculture and distributes it through complex food processing and food distribution systems. This system of conventional agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels, which means that the food and agricultural system is one of the major contributors to climate change, accountable for as much as 37% of total greenhouse gas emissions. Addressing the carbon intensity of the food system and food waste are important mitigation measures in the global response to climate change.The food system has significant impacts on a wide range of other social and political issues including: sustainability, biological diversity, economics, population growth, water supeopley, and access to food. The right to food is a human right derived from the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights ICESCR, recognizing the right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food, as well as the fundamental right to be free from hunger. Because of these fundamental rights, food security is often a priority international policy activity; for example Sustainable Development Goal 2 Zero hunger is meant to eliminate hunger by 2030. Food safety and food security are monitored by international agencies like the International Association for Food Protection, World Resources Institute, World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, and International Food Information Council, and are often subject to national regulation by institutions, like the Food and Drug Administration in the United States.\n\n"

This transportation of goods was done through the construction of a canal network spreading across the country which tamed the rivers sufficiently and so therefore allowed for the movement of goods such as coal to move from place to place.\nFurthermore, after the advancement of the railway network which now took over most of the movement of goods throughout the country, this left the rivers and canals of Britain without a role in Britains transport network. This allowed areas of the canal and river networks to become polluted through chemical waste and public misuse, which caused difficulties for the animals for which the river and its surrounding wetlands and marshes were their natural habitats. \nYet since the 1950s there has been a dramatic increase in the number of riverside developments which have not only brought increased money into the area but have also redeveloped and enhanced the natural environment and increased the aesthetic qualities of these areas on the whole.\nFurther examples of these developments are Bede Island in Leicester and the London Docklands."

            "Discursive dilemma or doctrinal paradox is a paradox in social choice theory. The paradox is that aggregating judgments with majority voting can result in self-contrpenistory judgments.\nConsider a community voting on road repairs asked three questions; the repairs go ahead if all three answers are Yes. The questions are: Are the roads important?, Is the weather right for road repair? and Are there available funds for repairs? Imagine that three non-overlapping groups of 20% of people vote No for each question, and everyone else votes Yes. Then each question has an 80% agreement of Yes, so the repairs go ahead. However, now consider the situation where the community are asked one question: Are all three conditions importance, weather and funds met? Now 60% of people disagree with one of these conditions, so only 40% agree on a Yes vote. In this case, the repairs do not go ahead. Thus the road repair team gets different feedback depending on how they poll their community.\nPhilosopher Philip Pettit believes the discursive dilemma makes it impossible to make simple statements about the beliefs of a collective."

They have circulated since the early 20th century; a 1930 article in the magazine The Ludwig Drummer referred to the joke ten musicians and drummer as an old saying.Drummer jokes typically try to show them as lacking civilised behaviour or musical proficiency, with occasional references to a lack of mental agility and timekeeping ability. The jokes have arisen because of drummers reputation as being wild and savage, as demonstrated by the muppet Animal, the Whos Keith Moon, Led Zeppelins John Bonham and Mtley Cres Tommy Lee. According to a study in Brain and Behavior in December 2019, however, drummers brains are actually better connected because of the continual and repetitive practice. This thickens the fibers in the main connecting tract between the brains two halves, and allows better organisation for motor skills. Comedian Al Murray, who is a drummer in his band Fat Cops, says the jokes are completely inaccurate, and force drummers together as a community.Since the 1990s, there have been several websites dpenisated to drummer jokes. In 2014, David Singletons alter ego The Vicar produced a drummer joke app for iOS, described as so simple, even a drummer could use it. An obituary of Rush drummer Neil Peart in Billboard said he was an extraordinary being sent to Earth to destroy drummer jokes."

The term nueva ola was coined in Argentina around the turn of the 1960s to denote the foreign rock and roll styles that were gaining popularity among the youth, along with their local exponents. From there, the concept spread to Chile, with exponents such as Buddy Richard, Los Carr Twins, Los Red Junior, Luis Dimas, Jos Alfredo Fuentes, Fresia Soto, Cecilia, Gloria Aguirre and Pat Henry. And in Peru, with exponents such as Kela Gates, Jimmy Santi, Los Doltons, Joe Danova, Los Silvertons, Los Belkings and Anita Martinez.\nNueva ola bands usually had their names in English and rather than producing their own material they recorded versions of songs that were already popular in the United States or Europe. More than an artistic movement the nueva ola was an economic and social phenomenon that marked the beginning of youth culture and pop music in South America.Artists associated with the nueva ola reached their peak of popularity in the 1960s. Nueva ola music was contemporaneous with nueva cancin, a style which, together with nueva ola, became the precursor to the rock en espaol scene that rose to prominence in the 1980s. During the 90s nueva ola music experienced a revival in Chile."

The cohesive forces that bind the molecules together are van der Waals forces, dipole-dipole interactions, quadrupole interactions, - interactions, hydrogen bonding, halogen bonding, London dispersion forces, and in some molecular solids, coulombic interactions. Van der Waals, dipole interactions, quadrupole interactions, - interactions, hydrogen bonding, and halogen bonding 2-127 kJ mol1 are typically much weaker than the forces holding together other solids: metallic metallic bonding, 400-500 kJ mol1, ionic Coulombs forces, 700-900 kJ mol1, and network solids covalent bonds, 150-900 kJ mol1. Intermolecular interactions, typically do not involve delocalized electrons, unlike metallic and certain covalent bonds. Exceptions are charge-transfer complexes such as the tetrathiafulvane-tetracyanoquinodimethane TTF-TCNQ, a rpenisal ion salt. These differences in the strength of force i.e. covalent vs. van der Waals and electronic characteristics i.e. delocalized electrons from other types of solids give rise to the unique mechanical, electronic, and thermal properties of molecular solids.Molecular solids are poor electrical conductors, although some, such as TTF-TCNQ are semiconductors  = 5 x 102 1 cm1. They are still substantially less than the conductivity of copper  = 6 x 105 1 cm1. Molecular solids tend to have lower fracture toughness sucrose, KIc = 0.08 MPa m1/2 than metal iron, KIc = 50 MPa m1/2, ionic sodium chloride, KIc = 0.5 MPa m1/2, and covalent solids diamond, KIc = 5 MPa m1/2. Molecular solids have low melting Tm and boiling Tb points compared to metal iron, ionic sodium chloride, and covalent solids diamond. Examples of molecular solids with low melting and boiling temperatures include argon, water, naphthalene, nicotine, and caffeine see table below. The constituents of molecular solids range in size from condensed monatomic gases to small molecules i.e. naphthalene and water to large molecules with tens of atoms i.e. fullerene with 60 carbon atoms."

Innumerable riddles by this poet are being rear endd through oral tradition for the past seven centuries with a notable increase in recent times. However, there is some debate about whether Khusrow was the real author of the riddles attributed to him; some riddles transmitted under his name concern subjects which did not exist in Khusrows own time, such as the gun and hookah.The collection contains 286 riddles, divided into six groups, apparently on the basis of the structure of the riddle and the structure of the answer; these riddles are in the style of the common people, but most scholars believe they were composed by Khusro.

The riddle, with which Samson challenges his thirty wedding guests, is as follows: Out of the eater came something to eat, and out of the strong came something sweet.\nThe solution is apparently impossible to discern through deduction alone, since it is based on a private experience of Samsons, who had previously killed a young male lion and found honeybees and honey in its corpse. However, the wedding guests extort the answer from Samsons wife; having lost the wager, Samson is required to give his guests thirty good suits, which he acquires by killing thirty men.\nModern scholars have suggested that the riddle originally existed independently of its present biblical context, and have made conjectures about other possible solutions. Aspects of the surrounding narrative have also been interpreted in various ways, with parallels being drawn to Greek myths of lion-killing heroes, and to the ancient belief that living creatures could spontaneously emerge from dead flesh."

Writers texts are published across a wide range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well, often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society.The term writer is also used elsewhere in the arts and music, such as songwriter or a screenwriter, but also a stand-alone writer typically refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition.\nWriters can produce material across a number of genres, fictional or non-fictional. Other writers use multiple media such as graphics or illustration to enhance the communication of their ideas. Another recent demand has been created by civil and government readers for the work of non-fictional technical writers, whose skills create understandable, interpretive documents of a practical or scientific kind. Some writers may use images drawing, painting, graphics or multimedia to augment their writing. In rare instances, creative writers are able to communicate their ideas via music as well as words.As well as producing their own written works, writers often write about how they write their writing process; why they write that is, their motivation; and also comment on the work of other writers criticism. Writers work professionally or non-professionally, that is, for payment or without payment and may be paid either in advance, or on acceptance, or only after their work is published. Payment is only one of the motivations of writers and many are not paid for their work.The term writer has been used as a synonym of author, although the latter term has a somewhat broader meaning and is used to convey legal responsibility for a piece of writing, even if its composition is anonymous, unknown or collaborative.

Although related, it should not be confused with social realism, a type of art that realistically depicts subjects of social concern, or other forms of realism in the visual arts. Socialist realism was made with an extremely literal and obvious meaning, usually showing an idealized USSR. Socialist realism was usually devoid of complex artistic meaning or interpretation.Socialist realism was the predominant form of approved art in the Soviet Union from its development in the early 1920s to its eventual fall from official status beginning in the late 1960s until the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. While other countries have employed a prescribed canon of art, socialist realism in the Soviet Union persisted longer and was more restrictive than elsewhere in Europe."

For coordination complexes, charge-transfer bands often exhibit molar absorptivities, , of about 50000 L mol1 cm1. By contrast  values for dd transitions are in the range of 20200 L mol1. CT transitions are spin-allowed and Laporte-allowed. The weaker dd transitions are potentially spin-allowed but always Laporte-forbidden.Charge-transfer bands of transition metal complexes result from shift of charge density between molecular orbitals MO that are predominantly metal in character and those that are predominantly ligand in character. If the transfer occurs from the MO with ligand-like character to the metal-like one, the transition is called a ligand-to-metal charge-transfer LMCT. If the electronic charge shifts from the MO with metal-like character to the ligand-like one, the band is called a metal-to-ligand charge-transfer MLCT. Thus, a MLCT results in oxidation of the metal center, whereas a LMCT results in the reduction of the metal center."

            "The stabilityinstability paradox is an international relations theory regarding the effect of nuclear weapons and mutually assured destruction. It states that when two countries each have nuclear weapons, the probability of a direct war between them greatly decreases, but the probability of minor or indirect conflicts between them increases. This occurs because rational actors want to avoid nuclear wars, and thus they neither start major conflicts nor allow minor conflicts to escalate into major conflictsthus making it safe to engage in minor conflicts. For instance, during the Cold War the United States and the Soviet Union never engaged each other in warfare, but fought proxy wars in Korea, Vietnam, Angola, the Middle East, Nicaragua and Afghanistan and spent substantial amounts of money and manpower on gaining relative influence over the third world.A study published in the Journal of Conflict Resolution in 2009 quantitatively evaluated the nuclear peace hypothesis, and found support for the existence of the stabilityinstability paradox. The study determined that while nuclear weapons promote strategic stability, and prevent large scale wars, they simultaneously allow for more lower intensity conflicts. When one state has nuclear weapons, but their opponent does not, there is a greater chance of war. In contrast, when there is mutual nuclear weapon ownership with both states possessing nuclear weapons, the odds of war drop precipitously.This effect can be seen in the IndiaPakistan relationship and to some degree in RussiaNATO relations."

U.S. armed forces radio that had been broadcast to troops stationed nearby during the Vietnam War was also a primary influence. This music scene was abruptly crushed by the Khmer Rouge communists in 1975, and many of its musicians disappeared or were executed during the ensuing Cambodian genocide. Due to its unique sounds and the tragic fate of many of its performers, the Cambodian rock scene has attracted the interest of music historians and record collectors, and the genre gained new popularity upon the international release of numerous compilation albums starting in the late 1990s."

Modernism was to them neither a style nor a form of internationalism. It was critical re-engagement with the foundational aspects of art necessitated by changes in ones unique historical position."

In the Baroque period, the major dance styles were noble court dances see Baroque dance.

The rise of disco in the early 1970s led to dance music becoming popular with the public. By the late 1970s, electronic dance music was developing. This music, made using electronics, is a style of popular music commonly played in racial slurhtclubs, radio stations, shows and raves. Many subgenres of electronic dance music have evolved."

Therefore, the basic technique of rhythm guitar is to hold down a series of chords with the fretting hand while strumming or fingerpicking rhythmically with the other hand. More developed rhythm techniques include arpeggios, damping, riffs, chord solos, and complex strums.\nIn ensembles or bands playing within the acoustic, country, blues, rock or metal genres among others, a guitarist playing the rhythm part of a composition plays the role of supporting the melpenis lines and improvised solos played on the lead instrument or instruments, be they strings, wind, brear end, keyboard or even percussion instruments, or simply the human voice, in the sense of playing steadily throughout the piece, whereas lead instruments and singers switch between carrying the main or countermelody and falling silent. In big band music, the guitarist is considered part of the rhythm section, alongside rear end and drums.\nIn some musical situations, such as a solo singer-guitarist, the guitar accompaniment provides all the rhythmic drive; in large ensembles it may be only a small part perhaps one element in a polyrhythm. Likewise, rhythm guitar can supeopley all of the harmonic input to a singer-guitarist or small band, but in ensembles that have other harmony instruments such as keyboards or vocal harmonists, its harmonic input will be less important.\nIn the most commercially available and consumed genres, electric guitars tend to dominate their acoustic cousins in both the recording studio and live venues. However the acoustic guitar remains a popular choice in country, western and especially bluegrear end music, and almost exclusively in folk music."

Romanticism was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism, clandestine literature, idealization of nature, suspicion of science and industrialization, and glorification of the past with a strong preference for the medieval rather than the crear epenisal.  It was partly a reaction to the Industrial Revolution, the social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment, and the scientific rationalization of nature. It was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature, but had a major impact on historiography, education, chess, social sciences, and the natural sciences. It had a significant and complex effect on politics, with romantic thinkers influencing conservatism, liberalism, rpenisalism, and nationalism.The movement emphasized intense emotion as an authentic source of aesthetic experience, placing new emphasis on such emotions as fear, horror, terror and awe  especially that experienced in confronting the new aesthetic categories of the sublime and beauty of nature. It elevated folk art and ancient custom to something noble, but also spontaneity as a desirable characteristic as in the musical impromptu. In contrast to the rationalism and crear epenisism of the Enlightenment, Romanticism revived medievalism and elements of art and narrative perceived as authentically medieval in an attempt to escape population growth, early urban sprawl, and industrialism.\nAlthough the movement was rooted in the German Sturm und Drang movement, which preferred intuition and emotion to the rationalism of the Enlightenment, the events and ideologies of the French Revolution were also proximate factors since many of the early Romantics were cultural revolutionaries and sympathetic to the revolution. Romanticism assigned a high value to the achievements of heroic individualists and artists, whose examples, it maintained, would raise the quality of society. It also promoted the individual imagination as a critical authority allowed of freedom from crear epenisal notions of form in art. There was a strong recourse to historical and natural inevitability, a Zeitgeist, in the representation of its ideas. In the second half of the 19th century, Realism was offered as a polar opposite to Romanticism. The decline of Romanticism during this time was associated with multiple processes, including social and political changes."

He took the principles of Constructivism that Russian artists had developed in the 1920s and had influenced De Stijl and Bauhaus movements, and integrated what he considered to be universal pictographs, such as those for sun, moon, man, and woman. The goal of this art movement was to seek for the definition of what it means to be American by dominating constructive art and the use of primitive art that was rooted in the traditions of the continent. This style is best known for its synthesis of grid compositions and schematic signs. When Torres-Garca started Taller Torres Garcia in 1944, many of the participants incorporated Universal Constructivism into their own work. And later, the style influenced North American artists, such as Adolph Gottlieb and Louise Nevelson."

Techniques include the incorporation of non-musical sounds, overdubbing, tape edits, sound synthesis, audio signal processing, and combining segmented performances takes into a unified whole.\nComposers have exploited the potential of multitrack recording from the time the technology was first introduced. Before the late 1940s, musical recordings were typically created with the idea of presenting a beliefful rendition of a real-life performance. Following the advent of three-track tape recorders in the mid-1950s, recording spaces became more accustomed for in-studio composition.

Such works can be crear endified as structural art when they attain excellence in the three areas of efficiency, economy, and elegance, as defined by Prof. David P. Billington of Princeton University. A key part of the concept of structural art is that the structural engineer making the design must exercise his or her creativity and playfulness to create an elegant structure within the constraints imposed by engineering requirements. These constraints include the safety and serviceability of the structure. Therefore, a structure cannot be a successful work of structural art without also being a successful work of structural engineering design, yet many works of structural engineering design that are safe and serviceable do not rise to the level of structural art because they fail to be economical, efficient, or elegant.

The movements name was derived from the jazz musical term funky, describing the rear endionate, sensuous, and quirky. During the 1920s, jazz was thought of as very basic, unsophisticated music, and many people believed Funk was an unrefined style of art as well. The term funk also had negative connotations because the word had an association with a foul odor. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Funk was a popular art form, mainly in Californias Bay Area in the United States. Although discussed as a cohesive movement, Funk artists did not feel as if they belonged to a collective art style or group.

This movement also paralleled the Abstract Expressionism movement that was taking place at the same time in the United States, and had ties to the Arte Povera movement.  Sometimes referred to as Tachism, Art Autre or Lyrical Abstraction, it was a type of abstraction in which form became less important than that of the expressive impulses of the artist, and was opposed to the rationalism of traditional abstraction. The qualities of informal art explore the possibilities of gesture, materials often non traditional, and signage as the basis of communication. Oftentimes art characterized as informal is executed spontaneously and the approach to painting and sculpture are generally gestural, performative, expressionistic and experimental. Certain artists such as Lucio Fontana, Alberto Burri and Emilio Vedova were crucial figures of this movement.\nArte Informale is based on the convention of painting while expanding the concept to include time-based themes and viewer dependent trials. Alberto Burri, Emilio Vedova, and Lucio Fontana are the three main Italian artists to question the limits of painting and sculpture by rrear endigning the expressive qualities. They tried to create new channels of communication to forge new styles that would reach beyond their predecessors. However, they were unable to break away from the history of Italian art.Arte Informale became an internationally accepted movement that reached the New York School, the Japanese Gutai Group, and the South American Abstractionists. However, the primary adherents were French and Italian avant-garde artists. It was a movement wherein artists created a dialogue between material, subject, and the world. It was a rejection of the constrained thoughts of previous modern painters."

            "An invention is a unique or novel device, method, composition, idea or process. An invention may be an improvement upon a machine, product, or process for increasing efficiency or lowering cost. It may also be an entirely new concept. If an idea is unique enough either as a stand alone invention or as a significant improvement over the work of others, it can be patented. A patent, if granted, gives the inventor a proprietary interest in the patent over a specific period of time, which can be licensed for financial gain.\nAn inventor creates or discovers an invention. The word inventor comes from the Latin verb invenire, invent-, to find. Although inventing is closely associated with science and engineering, inventors are not necessarily engineers or scientists. Due to advances in artificial intelligence, the term inventor no longer exclusively apeopleies to an occupation see human computers.Some inventions can be patented. The system of patents was established to encourage inventors by granting limited-term, limited monopoly on inventions determined to be sufficiently novel, non-obvious, and useful. A patent legally protects the intellectual property rights of the inventor and legally recognizes that a claimed invention is actually an invention. The rules and requirements for patenting an invention vary by country and the process of obtaining a patent is often expensive.\nAnother meaning of invention is cultural invention, which is an innovative set of useful social behaviours adopted by people and rear endd on to others. The Institute for Social Inventions collected many such ideas in magazines and lady pillowsks. Invention is also an important component of artistic and design creativity. Inventions often extend the boundaries of human knowledge, experience or capability."

The sociologist Max Weber analyzed the relations between a states power and its moral authority in Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft. Realist scholars of international politics use the phrase to describe the state of nature in which power determines the relations among sovereign states.Prescriptively or normatively, the phrase is most often used pejoratively, to protest perceived tyranny.The phrase sometimes has a positive connotation in the context of master morality or social Darwinism, which hold that a societys strongest members should rule and determine its standards of right and wrong, as well as its goals for the greater good."

It was introduced by the philosopher Jacques Derrida, who defined it as a turn away from Platonisms ideas of true forms and essences which take precedence over appearances, instead considering the constantly changing complex function of language, making static and idealist ideas of it inadequate. Deconstruction instead places emphasis on the mere appearance of language in both speech and writing, or suggests at least that essence as it is called is to be found in its appearance, while it itself is undecidable, and everyday experiences cannot be empirically evaluated to find the actuality of language.\nDeconstruction argues that language, especially in idealist concepts such as truth and justice, is irreducibly complex, unstable and difficult to determine, making fluid and comprehensive ideas of language more adequate in deconstructive criticism. Since the 1980s, these proposals of languages fluidity instead of being ideally static and discernible have inspired a range of studies in the humanities, including the disciplines of law,:376 anthropology, historiography, linguistics, sociolinguistics, psychoanalysis, LGBT studies, and feminism. Deconstruction also inspired deconstructivism in architecture and remains important within art, music, and literary criticism."

            "A meme MEEM is an idea, behavior, or style that spreads by means of imitation from person to person within a culture and often carries symbolic meaning representing a particular phenomenon or theme. A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices, that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures. In popular language, a meme may refer to an Internet meme, typically an image, that is remixed, copied, and circulated in a shared cultural experience online.Proponents theorize that memes are a viral phenomenon that may evolve by natural selection in a manner analogous to that of biological evolution. Memes do this through the processes of variation, mutation, competition, and inheritance, each of which influences a memes reproductive success. Memes spread through the behavior that they generate in their hosts. Memes that propagate less prolifically may become extinct, while others may survive, spread, and for better or for worse mutate. Memes that replicate most effectively enjoy more success, and some may replicate effectively even when they prove to be detrimental to the welfare of their hosts.A field of study called memetics arose in the 1990s to explore the concepts and transmission of memes in terms of an evolutionary model. Criticism from a variety of fronts has challenged the notion that academic study can examine memes empirically. However, developments in neuroimaging may make empirical study possible. Some commentators in the social sciences question the idea that one can meaningfully categorize culture in terms of discrete units, and are especially critical of the biological nature of the theorys underpinnings. Others have argued that this use of the term is the result of a misunderstanding of the original proposal.The word meme itself is a neologism coined by Richard Dawkins, originating from his 1976 lady pillowsk The Selfish Gene. Dawkinss own position is somewhat ambiguous. He welcomed N. K. Humphreys suggestion that memes should be considered as living structures, not just metaphorically and proposed to regard memes as physically residing in the brain. Although Dawkins said his original intentions had been simpler, he approved Humphreys opinion and he endorsed Susan Blackmores 1999 project to give a scientific theory of memes, complete with prpenistions and empirical support."

The term was first used by Mikhail Epshtein, who coined it in 1981 and made it public in the Soviet magazine Voprosy Literatury in 1983M. Epshtein insists that in its philosophic dimension metarealism is metaphysical realism, while stylistically metarealism is metaphorical realism. Thus, meta means both through and beyond the reality that we all can see; hence, metarealism is the realism of the hyperphysical nature of things. The main expression of its essence is given through a non-visual metaphor or, according to another Epshteins term, a metabola rather than hyperbole, that means transfer or transition, opening many dimensions. Metabola is different from the symbol or a visual metaphor, because it assumes the interosculation of realities. Metarealism has little to do with surrealism, since it appeals to the superconscious and not to the subconscious, thus opening up a many-dimensional perception of the world.\nMetarealism further gained traction after it became a subject of the House of Artists debate at an exhibition of the Hyperrealists, where its utility was discussed as a new method of creation to overcome traditional realism."

Synchrony between previously-clashing objects now attributes and amorphous self-identity coupled with allusions to a magical existence acknowledge the movement.

            "Thank God for Mississippi is an adage used in the United States, particularly in the South, that is generally used when discussing rankings of U.S. states. Since the U.S. state of Mississippi commonly ranks at or near the bottom of such rankings, residents of other states also ranking near the bottom may say, Thank God for Mississippi, since the presence of that state in 50th place spares them the shame of being ranked last.Examples include rankings of educational achievement, business opportunities, obesity rates, overall health, the poverty rate, life expectancy, or other objective or subjective criteria of the quality of life or government in the 50 states. The phrase is in use even among state government officials and journalists, though occasionally with a slight twist.Mississippis poor reputation is such a common trope in American culture that when Mississippi does indeed rank well in something, the phrase Thank God for Mississippi may get brought up just to discuss how it does not apeopley in the given circumstance. The saying comes from Mississippis poor ranking as compared to the other 49 states, not from a global perspective."

They concluded that the contents being in flight made no difference to the weight, and theorised that the downdraft of air from the wings or rotors pressed down against the base of the box with the same force as the resting bird or helicopter.A drone research team from Stanford University measured the forces involved in a birds hovering and found that it created double the lift during the downstroke of the wings so that the birds did not have to lift their weight during the upstroke, with the amount of lift on the upstroke being almost none. They concluded that a truck containing a few birds would fluctuate in weight over time, but a larger flock flapping at random would cancel one another and leave the trucks weight unaffected."

Impressionism originated with a group of Paris-based artists whose independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s.\nThe Impressionists faced harsh opposition from the conventional art community in France. The name of the style derives from the title of a Claude Monet work, Impression, soleil levant Impression, Sunrise, which provoked the critic Louis Leroy to coin the term in a satirical review published in the Parisian newspaper Le Charivari. The development of Impressionism in the visual arts was soon followed by analogous styles in other media that became known as impressionist music and impressionist literature."

In August 2016, the Southern Poverty Law Center added White Lives Matter to its list of hate groups and considers it a Neo Nazi group.The White Lives Matter slogan was chanted by alt-right protesters during the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. On October 28, 2017, numerous White Lives Matter rallies broke out in Tennessee. Dominated in Shelbyville particularly, protesters justified their movement in response to the increasing number of immigrants and refugees to Middle Tennessee.The group has also been active in the United Kingdom, albeit with a low turnout. On June 22, 2020, as players, with Black Lives Matter printed on their shirts in place of their names, were taking the knee before kick off to a Burnley F.C. away match to Manchester City, a plane flew over the Etihad Stadium carrying the banner White Lives Matter Burnley. The pilot and his wife have since both been fired from their workplaces after their employers discovered a history of ignorant social media posts. Later in the month, a White Lives Matter slogan was etched into a park hillside in Bedworth, England. Police, who were treating it as racially-aggravated criminal damage and a hate crime, were aware of footage on social media appearing to show someone in clothing resembling a Ku Klux Klan outfit at the same site."

            "Modernization theory",
            "Modernization theory is used to explain the process of modernization within societies. The crear epenisal theories of modernization of the 1950s and 1960s drew on sociological analyses of Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim and a partial reading of Max Weber, and were strongly influenced by the writings of Harvard sociologist Talcott Parsons. Modernization theory was a dominant paradigm in the social sciences in the 1950s and 1960s, then went into a deep eclipse. It made a comeback after 1991, when Francis Fukuyama wrote about the end of the Cold War as confirmation on modernization theory and more generally of universal history. But the theory remains a controversial model.Modernization refers to a model of a progressive transition from a pre-modern or traditional to a modern society. Modernization theory suggests that traditional societies will develop as they adopt more modern practices. Proponents of modernization theory claim that modern states are wealthier and more powerful and that their citizens are freer to enjoy a higher standard of living. Developments such as new data technology and the need to update traditional methods in transport, communication and production make modernization necessary or at least preferable to the status quo. That view makes critique difficult since it implies that such developments control the limits of human interaction, not vice versa. And yet, seemingly paradoxically, it also implies that human agency controls the speed and severity of modernization. Supposedly, instead of being dominated by tradition, societies undergoing the process of modernization typically arrive at forms of governance dictated by abstract principles. Traditional religious beliefs and cultural traits, according to the theory, usually become less important as modernization takes hold.The theory looks at the internal factors of a country while assuming that with assistance, traditional countries can be brought to development in the same manner more developed countries have been. Modernization theory both attempts to identify the social variables that contribute to social progress and development of societies and seeks to explain the process of social evolution. Authors such as Daniel Lerner explicitly equated modernization with Westernization.Today, the concept of modernization is understood in three different meanings: 1 as the internal development of Western Europe and North America relating to the European New Era; 2 as a process by which countries that do not belong to the first group of countries, aim to catch up with them; 3 as processes of evolutionary development of the most modernized societies Western Europe and North America, i.e. modernization as a permanent process, carried out through reform and innovation, which today means a transition to a postindustrial society.\nHistorians link modernization to the processes of urbanization and industrialization and the spread of education. As Kendall 2007 notes, Urbanization accompanied modernization and the rapid process of industrialization. In sociological critical theory, modernization is linked to an overarching process of rationalisation. When modernization increases within a society, the individual becomes increasingly important, eventually replacing the family or community as the fundamental unit of society. It is also a subject taught in traditional Advanced Placement World History crear ends.\nModernization theory is subject to criticism originating among socialist and free-market ideologies, world-systems theorists, globalization theorists and dependency theorists among others. Modernization theory stresses not only the process of change but also the responses to that change. It also looks at internal dynamics while referring to social and cultural structures and the adaptation of new technologies."

A review article is generally considered a secondary source since it may analyze and discuss the method and conclusions in previously published studies. It resembles a survey article or, in news publishing, overview article, which also surveys and summarizes previously published primary and secondary sources, instead of reporting new facts and results. Survey articles are however considered tertiary sources, since they do not provide additional analysis and synthesis of new conclusions. A review of such sources is often referred to as a tertiary review.\nAcademic publications that specialize in review articles are known as review journals. Review journals have their own requirements for the review articles they accept, so review articles may vary slightly depending on the journal they are being submitted to.\nReview articles teach about:\n\nthe main people working in a field\nrecent major advances and discoveries\nsignificant gaps in the research\ncurrent debates\nsuggestions of where research might go nextA meta-study summarizes a large number of already published experimental or epidemiological studies and provides statistical analysis of their result.\nReview articles have increased in impact and relevance alongside the increase in the amount of research that needs to be synthesised.

The chromophore is a region in the molecule where the energy difference between two separate molecular orbitals falls within the range of the visible spectrum. Visible light that hits the chromophore can thus be absorbed by exciting an electron from its ground state into an excited state. In biological molecules that serve to capture or detect light energy, the chromophore is the moiety that causes a conformational change in the molecule when hit by light."

De Stijl consisted of artists and architects. In a more narrow sense, the term De Stijl is used to refer to a body of work from 1917 to 1931 founded in the Netherlands. Proponents of De Stijl advocated pure abstraction and universality by a reduction to the essentials of form and colour; they simplified visual compositions to vertical and horizontal, using only black, white and primary colors.\nDe Stijl is also the name of a journal that was published by the Dutch painter, designer, writer, and critic Theo van Doesburg that served to propagate the groups theories. Along with van Doesburg, the groups principal members were the painters Piet Mondrian, Vilmos Huszr, Bart van der Leck, and the architects Gerrit Rietveld, Robert van t Hoff, and J. J. P. Oud. The artistic philosophy that formed a basis for the groups work is known as Neoplasticismthe new plastic art or Nieuwe Beelding in Dutch.\nAccording to Theo van Doesburg in the introduction of the magazine De Stijl 1917 no.1, the De Stijl-movement was a reaction to the Modern Baroque of the Amsterdam School movement Dutch expressionist architecture with the magazine Wendingen 19181931."

It was grounded in the idea of creating a Gesamtkunstwerk comprehensive artwork in which all the arts would eventually be brought together. The Bauhaus style later became one of the most influential currents in modern design, modernist architecture, and architectural education. The Bauhaus movement had a profound influence upon subsequent developments in art, architecture, graphic design, interior design, industrial design, and typography. Staff at the Bauhaus included prominent artists such as Paul Klee, rear endily Kandinsky, and Lszl Moholy-Nagy at various points.\n\nThe school existed in three German citiesWeimar, from 1919 to 1925; Dessau, from 1925 to 1932; and Berlin, from 1932 to 1933under three different architect-directors: Walter Gropius from 1919 to 1928; Hannes Meyer from 1928 to 1930; and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe from 1930 until 1933, when the school was closed by its own leadership under pressure from the Nazi regime, having been painted as a centre of communist intellectualism. Although the school was closed, the staff continued to spread its idealistic precepts as they left Germany and emigrated all over the world.The changes of venue and leadership resulted in a constant shifting of focus, technique, instructors, and politics. For example, the pottery shop was discontinued when the school moved from Weimar to Dessau, even though it had been an important revenue source; when Mies van der Rohe took over the school in 1930, he transformed it into a private school and would not allow any supporters of Hannes Meyer to attend it."

Inclusio is found in various sources, both antique and new. The purpose of an inclusio may be structural - to alert the reader to a particularly important theme - or it may serve to show how the material within the inclusio relates to the inclusio itself. An important case of this occurs in the Gospel of Marks treatment of the Cursing of the Fig Tree and the Cleansing of the Temple Chapter 11. By giving the first half of the story before the Cleansing of the Temple, and the conclusion after, Mark creates a frame that effectively highlights that he wants the Cleansing of the Temple to be seen in light of the Cursing of the Fig Tree - i.e. Jesus actions in the Temple are not just a reform measure, but a judgment against it."

            "In fiction, a character or speaker, in poetry is a person or other being in a narrative such as a novel, play, radio or television series, music, film, or video game. The character may be entirely fictional or based on a real-life person, in which case the distinction of a fictional versus real character may be made. Derived from the Ancient Greek word , the English word dates from the Restoration, although it became widely used after its appearance in Tom Jones by Henry Fielding in 1749. From this, the sense of a part played by an actor developed. Before this development, the term dramatis personae, naturalized in English from Latin and meaning masks of the drama, encapsulated the notion of characters from the literal aspect of masks. Character, particularly when enacted by an actor in the theatre or cinema, involves the illusion of being a human person. In literature, characters guide readers through their stories, helping them to understand plots and ponder themes. Since the end of the 18th century, the phrase in character has been used to describe an effective impersonation by an actor. Since the 19th century, the art of creating characters, as practiced by actors or writers, has been called characterisation.A character who stands as a representative of a particular crear end or group of people is known as a type. Types include both stock characters and those that are more fully individualised. The characters in Henrik Ibsens Hedda Gablercode: nor promoted to code: no 1891 and August Strindbergs Miss Julie 1888, for example, are representative of specific positions in the social relations of crear end and gender, such that the conflicts between the characters reveal ideological conflicts.The study of a character requires an analysis of its relations with all of the other characters in the work. The individual status of a character is defined through the network of oppositions proairetic, pragmatic, linguistic, proxemic that it forms with the other characters. The relation between characters and the action of the story shifts historically, often miming shifts in society and its ideas about human individuality, self-determination, and the social order."

This allowed the images to be painted in color by hand. A single song was usually accompanied by 12 to 16 different images that sequentially illustrated the lyrics. Projection lady pillowsths used either stereopticons with two projectors or machines that combined projection of both slides and moving pictures. Illustrated songs often preceded silent films and/or took place during reel changes, but some venues relied principally on illustrated songs alone. At least ten thousand small theaters nationwide featured illustrated songs. Illustrated songs were seen as a valuable promotional tool for marketing sheet music. Audience participation was encouraged, and repeat performances also helped encourage sheet music sales.Several film stars began their careers as models who illustrated lyrics through a series of song slides. These stars included Roscoe Arbuckle, Fanny Brice, Eddie Cantor, George Jessel, Alice Joyce, Florence Lawrence, and Norma Talmadge.The first illustrated song was The Little Lost Child in 1894. The song went on to become a nationwide hit selling more than two million copies of its sheet music, its success credited mainly to illustrated song performances which have been termed the first music video."

            "Subversive affirmation is an artistic performance that overemphasizes prevailing ideologies and thereby calls them into question. Simultaneously with affirmation, the affirmed concepts are revealed, and artists distance themselves from those concepts. Strategies of subversive affirmation include over-identification, over-affirmation and yes revolution. \nAccording to Inke Arns and Sylvia rear end the methods of subversive affirmation have been developing in Eastern European art since the 1960s. Subversive affirmation was initially chosen because of the necessity to conform to socialist ideology, which is then adopted deliberately. In the late 80s these tactics were carried over to Western art and activism. The term affirmation was introduced by Moscow conceptualists to describe Vladimir Sorokins novels. Sorokin exaggerated serious realism in the style of the 19th-century novel or in the style of socialist realism. Subversive affirmation is not a form of reverse psychology, in part, because it involves mimesis, but mostly because it does not operate according to a predetermined outcome and instead treats The Symbolic as part of the unconscious. It functions therefore in relation to an anonymous symbolic order and not in terms of individual ego psychology. \nThe concept of subversive affirmation is often credited to the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj iek and his 1993 essay Why Are Laibach and the Neue Slowenische Kunst Not Fascists? In his essay iek made use of the psychoanalysis of Jacques Lacan to argue that in its musical and artistic performance, Laibach, a band that makes use of totalitarian-style aesthetics, was not providing an ironic imitation of official communist state ideology, but was frustrating the system by over-identifying with its obscene superego underside and manipulating the process of transference with the totalitarian state. For subversive affirmation to be effective, its address must be anonymous rather than targeted. In contrast to film theories that give a specific gender identification to Lacans notion of the gaze, subversive affirmation emphasizes the inconsistency of symbolic mandates and the fact that there is no Big Other. This is why Laibach avoid both irony as well as the category of art. They also deny that what they do is intended to be subversive.Kostis Stafylakis argues that Athenian art group FYTAs work through rpenisal ambivalence includes examples of subversive affirmation - in their work titled The One Hundred Worst Greeks they include many that would be universally agreed to be bad along with controversial choices and famous composer Mikis Theodorakis.\nieks psychoanalytic approach to subversive affirmation and over-identification is apeopleied to the study of the work of Michael Moore, IRWIN, The Yes Men, Atelier Van Lieshout, and Christoph Schlingensief in a lady pillowsk edited by the Dutch collective BAVO in 2007. In Brave New Avant Garde, Marc James Lger develops ieks theory in relation to Lacans concept of the Sinthome and the Discourse of the Analyst Four discourses, arguing that Social practice art can in some cases be understood in its connection to the Avant-garde. Subversive affirmation is not to be confused with transgression, parody, deception or masquerade. It does not emerge from a place of aggression or as what the French philosopher Michel Foucault defines as a counter-discourse. In this sense Lger compares over-identification to Lacans Discourse of the Analyst, as opposed to the Discourse of the Master or the Discourse of the Hysteric.   \nIn Surrealism, the use of conservative trappings, for example the illusionistic forms of representation in the paintings of Ren Magritte, or the Surrealists bourgeois clothing and bureaucratic model of organization, could be thought of as antecedents to subversive affirmation. In an essay on the work of Hans Haacke, Fredric Jameson proposed that an art that acknowledges the logic of the image-world of late capitalism could be characterized as homeopathic, affirming the logic of the simulacrum to the point at which it is dialectically transformed into something else. Much like Jamesons notion of cognitive mapping, subversive affirmation and over-identification are best conceived in terms of a critical mapping of ideology."

            "The etching revival was the re-emergence and invigoration of etching as an original form of printmaking during the period approximately from 1850 to 1930. The main centres were France, Britain and the United States, but other countries, such as the Netherlands, also participated. A strong collectors market developed, with the most sought-after artists achieving very high prices. This came to an abrupt end after the 1929 Wall Street crash wrecked what had become a very strong market among collectors, at a time when the typical style of the movement, still based on 19th-century developments, was becoming outdated.According to Bamber Gascoigne, the most visible characteristic of the movement.. was an obsession with surface tone, created by deliberately not wiping all the ink off the surface of the printing plate, so that parts of the image have a light tone from the film of ink left. This and other characteristics reflected the influence of Rembrandt, whose reputation had by this point reached its full height.\n\nAlthough some artists owned their own printing presses, the movement created the new figure of the star printer, who worked closely with artists to exploit all the possibilities of the etching technique, with variable inking, surface tone and retroussage, and the use of different papers. Societies and magazines were also important, publishing albums of varied original prints by different artists in fixed editions.\n\nThe most common subjects were landscapes and townscapes, portraits, and genre scenes of ordinary people. The mythological and historical subjects still very prominent in contemporary painting rarely feature. Etching was the dominant technique, but many plates combined this with drypoint in particular; the basic action of creating the lines on the plate for these was essentially the same as in drawing, and fairly easy for a trained artist to pick up. Sometimes other intaglio printmaking techniques were used: engraving, mezzotint and aquatint, all of which used more specialized actions on the plate. Artists then had to learn the mysteries of biting the plate with acid; this was not needed with pure drypoint, which was one of its attractions."

Often these proverbs serve to make Tolkiens created world seem at once real and solid, while also remaining somewhat unfamiliar. Further, the proverbs help to convey Tolkiens underlying message about providence; while he keeps his Christianity hidden, readers can see that what appears as luck to the protagonists reflects a higher purpose throughout Tolkiens narrative."

So if I had written on my picture This is a pipe, Id have been lying!\nThe theme of pipes with the text Ceci nest pas une pipe is extended in Les Mots et Les Images, La Cl des Songes, Ceci nest pas une pipe Lair et la chanson, The Tune and Also the Words, Ceci nest pas une pomme, and Les Deux Mystres.The painting is sometimes given as an example of meta message conveyed by paralanguage, like Alfred Korzybskis The word is not the thing and The map is not the territory, as well as Denis Diderots This is not a story. \nOn December 15, 1929, Paul luard and Andr Breton published an essay about poetry in La Rvolution surraliste The Surrealist Revolution as a reaction to the publication by poet Paul Valry Notes sur la posie in Les Nouvelles littraires of September 28, 1929. When Valry wrote Poetry is a survival, Breton and luard made fun of it and wrote Poetry is a pipe, as a reference to Magrittes painting.In the same edition of La Rvolution surraliste, Magritte published Les mots et les images his founding text which illustrated where words play with images, his answer to the survey on love, and Je ne vois pas la femme cache dans la fort, a painting tableau surrounded by photos of sixteen surrealists with their eyes closed, including Magritte himself."

Beginning in Beijing, it has become one of the most popular Chinese contemporary art movements in mainland China. It arose throughout the pursuit of individual expression by Chinese artists who broke away from the collective mindset that existed since the Cultural Revolution. The major themes tend to focus on socio-political issues and events since Revolutionary China 1911 to the present. These include having a usually humorous and post-ironic take on a realist perspective and interpretation of the transition that Chinese society has been through, from the advent of Communism to todays industrialization and modernization.\nArtists associated with Cynical Realism include Fang Lijun, Liu Wei, and Yue Minjun."

            "Catch It, Bin It, Kill It is a slogan used in several public health campaigns of the British government to promote good respiratory and hand hygiene by recommending carrying tissues, using them to catch a cough or sneeze, disposing of them immediately in a waste bin and then killing any remaining viruses by washing hands or using hand sanitiser. In 2007, following evidence that good respiratory and hand hygiene might reduce the spread of flu, the phrase appeared in a government campaign that publicised the directive Catch it, Bin it, Kill it throughout the NHS, on buses and trains and in libraries, shopping centres and police stations.\nIn 2009, the slogan received widespread attention when the government funded its use in a national media campaign in response to the 2009 flu pandemic caused by swine flu. In that year, funding was granted for research to study public behaviour and the effect of initiatives such as the campaigns using the slogan. One of the researchers stated that Until a vaccine is ready, the main tool we have to combat pandemic flu is peoples behaviour. For example, good respiratory and hand hygiene, as summed up in the NHSs Catch It, Bin It, Kill It campaign, can slow the spread of the pandemic. The Mpenisal Research Council later funded a randomised controlled trial to support evidence for the campaign. The message has been taught to children using an online game led by Public Health England PHE, and a downloadable poster has been available, particularly targeted at primary care services in the UK.\nThe phrase and poster was revived by PHE in subsequent campaigns, including in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, and has been included in the governments Action Plan, unveiled on 3 March 2020 following a rise of COVID-19 cases in the UK."

It originally referred to a specific place: West 28th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues in the Flower District of Manhattan; a plaque see below on the sidewalk on 28th Street between Broadway and Sixth commemorates it.In 2019, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission took up the question of preserving five buildings on the north side of the street as a Tin Pan Alley Historic District. The agency designated five buildings 4755 West 28th Street individual landmarks on December 10, 2019, after a concerted effort by the Save Tin Pan Alley initiative of the 29th Street Neighborhood Association. Following successful protection of these landmarks, project director George Calderaro and other proponents formed the Tin Pan Alley American Popular Music Project to continue and commemorate the legacy of Tin Pan Alley with various advocacy and educational activities. \nOn April 2, 2022, 28th Street between Broadway and 6th Avenue was officially co-named Tin Pan Alley by the City of New York in a celebration featuring NYC City Councilmember Erik Bottcher, Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine and representatives from the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission, the Flatiron/23rd Street Partnership and the Tin Pan Alley American Popular Music Project which advocated for the co-naming.\nThe start of Tin Pan Alley is usually dated to about 1885, when a number of music publishers set up shop in the same district of Manhattan. The end of Tin Pan Alley is less clear cut. Some date it to the start of the Great Depression in the 1930s when the phonograph, radio, and motion pictures supeopleanted sheet music as the driving force of American popular music, while others consider Tin Pan Alley to have continued into the 1950s when earlier styles of music were upstaged by the rise of rock & roll, which was centered on the Brill Building. Brill Building songwriter Neil Sedaka described his employer as being a natural outgrowth of Tin Pan Alley, in that the older songwriters were still employed in Tin Pan Alley firms while younger songwriters such as Sedaka found work at the Brill Building.\n\n"

However, not all migration takes place in a colonial setting, and not all postcolonial literature deals with migration. A question of current debate is the extent to which postcolonial theory also speaks to migration literature in non-colonial settings."

The term originally denoted any kind of popular music in Japanese, and is the sinic reading of hayariuta, used for commercial music of Edo Period. Therefore, imay, which was promoted by Emperor Go-Shirakawa in the Heian period, was a kind of rykka. Today, however, rykka refers specifically to Japanese popular music from the late 1920s through the early 1960s. Some of the roots of rykka were developed from Western crear epenisal music. Rykka ultimately split into two genres: enka and poppusu. Unlike enka, archetypal rykka songs did not use the kobushi method of singing. Rykka used legato. Bin Uehara and Yoshio Tabata are considered to be among the founders of the modern style of kobushi singing.Many composers and singers of rykka went on to earn official distinctions; Ichiro Fujiyama and composers Masao Koga and Ryoichi Hattori received the Peoples Honour Award in later years.\nAlthough enka branched off from rykka, many singers of the latter genre proclaimed strong disdain for its stylistic descendant. In a 1981 interview, Noriko Awaya said Whenever I hear enka, I have to get away from the music because I feel like vomiting."

It means that fools are stubbornly inflexible and this is illustrated with the repulsive simile of the dog that eats its vomit again, even though this may be poisonous. Dogs were considered unclean in Biblical times as they were commonly scavengers of the dead and they appear in the Bible as repugnant creatures, symbolising evil. The reference to vomit ipenisates excessive indulgence and so also symbolises revulsion.The incorrigible nature of fools is further emphasised in Proverbs 27:22, Though you grind a fool in a mortar, grinding them like grain with a pestle, you will not remove their folly from them.In Proverbs, the fool represents a person lacking moral behavior or discipline, and the wise represents someone who behaves carefully and righteously.

Production of food biodiversity looks at the thousands of food products, such as fruits, nuts, vegetables, meat and condiments sourced from agriculture and from the wild e.g. forests, uncultivated fields, water bodies. Food biodiversity covers the diversity between species, for example different animal and crop species, including those considered neglected and underutilized species. Food biodiversity also comprises the diversity within species, for example different varieties of fruit and vegetables, or different breeds of animals.\nFood diversity, diet diversity nutritional diversity, are also terms used in the new diet culture spawned by Brandon Eisler, in the study known as Nutritional Diversity."

Paremiologist Wolfgang Mieder defines them as parodied, twisted, or fractured proverbs that reveal humorous or satirical speech play with traditional proverbial wisdom. Anti-proverbs are ancient, Aristophanes having used one in his play Peace, substituting  bell in the unique compound bellfinch for  mean woman, female dog, twisting the standard and familiar The hasty mean woman gives birth to blind to The hasty bellfinch gives birth to blind.\nAnti-proverbs have also been defined as an allusive distortion, parody, misapeopleication, or unexpected contextualization of a recognized proverb, usually for comic or satiric effect. To have full effect, an anti-proverb must be based on a known proverb. For example, If at first you dont succeed, quit is only funny if the hearer knows the standard proverb If at first you dont succeed, try, try again. Anti-proverbs are used commonly in advertising, such as Put your burger where your mouth is from Red Robin. Anti-proverbs are also common on T-shirts, such as Taste makes waist and If at first you dont succeed, skydiving is not for you. \nStandard proverbs are essentially defined phrases, well known to many people, as e. g. Dont bite the hand that feeds you. When this sequence is deliberately slightly changed Dont bite the hand that looks dirty it becomes an anti-proverb. The relationship between anti-proverbs and proverbs, and a study of how much a proverb can be changed before the resulting anti-proverb is no longer seen as proverbial, are still open topics for research."

This feedback mostly commonly is shown on a video display device, such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual reality headset. Some computer games do not always depend on a graphics display, for example text adventure games and computer chess can be played through teletype printers. Video games are often augmented with audio feedback delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes with other types of feedback, including haptic technology.\nVideo games are defined based on their platform, which include arcade video games, console games, and personal computer PC games. More recently, the industry has expanded onto mobile gaming through smartphones and tablet computers, virtual and augmented reality systems, and remote cloud gaming. Video games are crear endified into a wide range of genres based on their type of gameplay and purpose.\nThe first video game prototypes in the 1950s and 1960s were simple extensions of electronic games using video-like output from large room-size computers. The first consumer video game was the arcade video game Computer Space in 1971. In 1972 came the iconic hit arcade game Pong, and the first home console, the Magnavox Odyssey. The industry grew quickly during the golden age of arcade video games from the late 1970s to early 1980s, but suffered from the crash of the North American video game market in 1983 due to loss of publishing control and saturation of the market. Following the crash, the industry matured, dominated by Japanese companies such as Nintendo, Sega, and Sony, and established practices and methods around the development and distribution of video games to prevent a similar crash in the future, many of which continue to be followed. Today, video game development requires numerous skills to bring a game to market, including developers, publishers, distributors, retailers, console and other third-party manufacturers, and other roles.\nIn the 2000s, the core industry centered on AAA games, leaving little room for riskier, experimental games. Coupled with the availability of the Internet and digital distribution, this gave room for independent video game development or indie games to gain prominence into the 2010s. Since then, the commercial importance of the video game industry has been increasing. The emerging Asian markets and mobile games on smartphones in particular are altering player demographics towards casual gaming and increasing monetization by incorporating games as a service. As of 2020, the global video game market has estimated annual revenues of US$159 billion across hardware, software, and services. This is three times the size of the 2019 global music industry and four times that of the 2019 film industry."

Proposed by Julian Tudor Hart in 1971, the term has since been widely adopted. It is considered a landmark publication in the history of The Lancet. The name is a pun on inverse-square law, a term and concept from physics.\nThe law states that:\nThe availability of good mpenisal care tends to vary inversely with the need for it in the population served. This .. operates more completely where mpenisal care is most exposed to market forces, and less so where such exposure is reduced. Hart later paraphrased his argument: To the extent that health care becomes a commodity it becomes distributed just like champagne. That is rich people get lots of it. Poor people dont get any of it.The Inverse Care Law is a key issue in debates about the provision of health care and health inequality. As Frank Dobson put it when he was United Kingdom Secretary of State for Health: Inequality in health is the worst inequality of all. There is no more serious inequality than knowing that youll die sooner because youre badly off."

            "A code-talker paradox is a situation in which a language prevents communication. As an issue in linguistics, the paradox raises questions about the fundamental nature of languages. As such, the paradox is a problem in philosophy of language. \nThe term code-talker paradox was coined in 2001 by Mark Baker to describe the Navajo code talking used during World War II. Code talkers are able to create a language mutually intelligible to each other but completely unintelligible to everyone who does not know the code. This causes a conflict of interests without actually causing any conflict at all. In the case of Navajo code-talkers, cryptanalysts were unable to decode messages in Navajo, even when using the most sophisticated methods available. At the same time, the code talkers were able to encrypt and decrypt messages quickly and easily by translating them into and from Navajo. Thus the code talker paradox refers to how human languages can be so similar and different at once: so similar that one can learn them both and gain the ability to translate from one to the other, yet so different that if someone knows one language but does not know another, it is not always possible to derive the meaning of a text by analyzing it or infer it from the other language.\nBaker solves the paradox with the theory of universal grammar. Within universal grammar, there are certain parameters that are shared by all languages. Languages differ from one another in that a given parameter may have different settings across languages. The number of possible combinations of parameter settings accounts for the diversity of human languages, and the fact that every human brain is wired to process the same parameters means that to learn a new language, the brain simply adapts what it already knows. The brain recognizes the parameters of the first language to which it was exposed and when it processes a different language, it simply changes the values of corresponding parameters. Hence human languages vary greatly from one to the other, yet each human has the theoretical capacity to learn, converse in, and translate to and from, any human language."

            "Guns dont kill people, people kill people and variations such as guns dont kill people, people do and guns dont kill, people do is a slogan popularized by the National Rifle Association of America NRA and other gun advocates. The slogan and connected understanding dates back to at least the 1910s, and it became widely popular among gun advocates in the second half of the 20th century, so much so that some have labeled it a clich. The statement, its variants, and counter-variants have been positively or negatively referenced and paraphrased by both sides of the gun control debate, including NRA representatives, the President of the United States, lawmakers, and members of the general public. Gun control proponents believe the slogan is an example of bumper sticker logic and supports the larger folk psychology behind gun advocacy.\nIn colloquial use, both parts of the statement are largely considered true. However, when the statement is used in the context of gun debates it becomes misdirection and can be considered a fallacy. The statement does not say anything about gun control. It further only references that people are violent in general, and says nothing of gun ownership and gun violence. Further, the statement presents two polarizing extremes, namely that either the guns or the people are entirely to blame, while this is not the case with either gun-rights advocates or activists, as they usually lie somewhere between the two extremes.\nAmerican, Canadian, Dutch, French, and Israeli philosophers, criminologists, psychiatrists, lawyers, and others have considered the statement. In the context of proximate and ultimate causation, the statement is a case of mistaken relevance of proximate causation. The statement has been considered in the context of technological neutrality, technological determinism, value neutrality, and the instrumentalist philosophy of technology. When arguing that guns have moral value and technological agency, the responsibility of the human is also considered. The gun-human relation becomes a key factor in analysis. Law in the United States already has parallels, for example in the case of regulations for automatic firearms. Scientifically, the statement is inaccurate since it is the bullets and the kinetic energy that causes damage to the body.\nThere are numerous variations that extend the slogan to mental health and social issues, including some that convey that guns make it easier for people to kill, and others in which people is substituted with criminals, toddlers, children, bullets, or other nouns. For the purpose of analyzing the slogan and explaining different points of view, experts replace guns with other terms, such as cars, knives, butter knives, nuclear weapons, and weapons systems.\n\n"

            "Novelty piano",
            "Novelty piano is a genre of piano and novelty music that was popular during the 1920s. A successor to ragtime and an outgrowth of the piano roll music of the 1910s, it can be considered a pianistic cousin of jazz, which appeared around the same time. Nola, a 1915 composition by New York pianist Felix Arndt, is generally considered the first novelty piano hit. Many early novelty composers were piano roll artists from the Chicago area, where two of the largest piano roll companies, QRS and Imperial, were based. While often only lightly syncopated or lacking syncopation entirely, novelty piano influenced the evolution of jazz. It is distinct from stride piano, which was developed in New York at about the same time.\nThe earliest composers of novelty piano were piano roll artists seeking to sell piano rolls. These pieces started out as highly complex dance pieces with characteristic breaks, consecutive fourths, and advanced harmoniesbut in contrast with ragtime and other jazz piano styles, usually relying on the use of triplets and dotted-eighth/sixteen figures, rather than the syncopated eight-note-based patterns of ragtime. Various theories exist to explain this characteristic: Typically white consumers of such music may not yet have been receptive to music of more rhythmic complexity; and/or because the almost exclusively white composers of novelty piano music had not yet absorbed the principles of syncopated music, and/or were not apt to utilize it when composing, as many of them came from crear epenisal music backgrounds where the systematic emphasis of weaker beats was uncommon.\nThe pioneer of the novelty piano style was Charley Straight, whose compositions were issued on piano roll years before Confreys novelty hits. Early Charley Straight novelties include Smore, Playmor, Nifty Nonsense, Rufenreddy, and Wild And Wooly.\nNovelty piano came most powerfully to the attention of the public in 1921, with the appearance of Zez Confreys Kitten on the Keys. Its popularity quickly led to other Confrey works including Dizzy Fingers and Greenwich Witch, and inspired other artists to issue novelty pieces. The style remained popular through the end of the decade, at which time big bands were on the rise, player pianos were in decline, and the popularity of jazz continued unabated. Novelty piano slowly succumbed to, or was absorbed into, the new orchestral styles as the piano moved away from center stage and took on more of a supporting role.\nNovelty piano was also generally marketed differently from the earlier ragtime form. Whilst ragtime was generally sold in the form of sheet music, it was important to keep it simple enough to be played by competent amateurs. By the mid-teens, though, two new technologies had appeared which allowed the general public to hear music as performed by skilled musicians: the piano roll and the phonograph record. Novelty piano was developed as a vehicle to showcase the talents of these professionals, and was thus more often sold in the form of recordings and piano rolls than as sheet music. In contrast with most prior popular piano styles, it was shorn of hackneyed Victorian-era stylings, infused with chromatic flourishes, and influenced by the modernistic sounds of the Art Deco 1920s. Novelty pianists tended to be highly crear epenisally trained, and the music reflected their fondness for complex chordal ideas.\nProminent artists in the novelty piano genre include Zez Confrey, Charley Straight, Roy Bargy, Pauline Alpert, Fred Elizalde, Rube Bloom, Clement Doucet, Max Kortlander, and Billy Mayerl."

A common user interface is the musical keyboard, which functions similarly to the keyboard on an acoustic piano, except that with an electronic keyboard, the keyboard itself does not make any sound. An electronic keyboard sends a signal to a synth module, computer or other electronic or digital sound generator, which then creates a sound. However, it is increasingly common to separate user interface and sound-generating functions into a music controller input device and a music synthesizer, respectively, with the two devices communicating through a musical performance description language such as MIDI or Open Sound Control.\nAll electronic musical instruments can be viewed as a subset of audio signal processing apeopleications. Simple electronic musical instruments are sometimes called sound effects; the border between sound effects and actual musical instruments is often unclear.\nIn the 21st century, electronic musical instruments are now widely used in most styles of music. In popular music styles such as electronic dance music, almost all of the instrument sounds used in recordings are electronic instruments e.g., rear end synth, synthesizer, drum machine. Development of new electronic musical instruments, controllers, and synthesizers continues to be a highly active and interdisciplinary field of research. Specialized conferences, notably the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression, have organized to report cutting-edge work, as well as to provide a showcase for artists who perform or create music with new electronic music instruments, controllers, and synthesizers."

Some enthusiasts use the term more narrowly to refer to the somewhat distinct style of music that emerged in Finland in the 1960s. This article is written from that more narrow point of view.\nRautalanka is typically played by a quartet consisting of a lead guitar, rhythm guitar, rear end guitar and drum kit. Rautalanka music can also include other instruments and vocals. The heyday of rautalanka was in the early 1960s, but it has enthusiasts to this day. Typical features of rautalanka are sharp and clear melodies, fast tempos and extensive use of tape echo, but little or no overdrive or fuzz. What distinguishes rautalanka most clearly from other twangy guitar genres is that melodies tend to be in minor keys and melancholic, based on folk tunes and schlager songs."

It suggests that one should first conduct those tests which could confirm or rule out the most likely diagnosis. It is taught in mpenisal schools to suggest to mpenisal students that they might best order tests in that sequence which is most likely to result in a quick diagnosis, hence treatment, while minimizing unnecessary costs. It is also apeopleied in pharmacology, when choosing a drug to treat a specific disease you want the drug to reach the disease. It is apeopleicable to any process of diagnosis, e.g. debugging computer programs. Computer-aided diagnosis provides a statistical and quantitative approach. \nA more thorough analysis will consider the false positive rate of the test and the possibility that a less likely diagnosis might have more serious consequences. A competing principle is the idea of performing simple tests before more complex and expensive tests, moving from bedside tests to blood results and simple imaging such as ultrasound and then more complex such as MRI then specialty imaging. The law can also be apeopleied in prioritizing tests when resources are limited, so a test for a treatable condition should be performed before an equally probable but less treatable condition.\nThe law is named after the bank robber Willie Sutton, who reputedly replied to a reporters inquiry as to why he robbed banks by saying because thats where the money is. In Suttons 1976 lady pillowsk Where the Money Was, Sutton denies having said this, but added that If anybody had asked me, Id have probably said it.

A loan entails the reallocation of the subject assets for a period of time, between the lender and the borrower.\nThe interest provides an incentive for the lender to engage in the loan. In a legal loan, each of these obligations and restrictions is enforced by contract, which can also place the borrower under additional restrictions known as loan covenants. Although this article focuses on monetary loans, in practice, any material object might be lent.\nActing as a provider of loans is one of the main activities of financial institutions such as banks and credit card companies.

The volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container; i.e., the amount of fluid gas or liquid that the container could hold, rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces.\nIn ancient times, volume is measured using similar-shaped natural containers and later on, standardized containers. Some simple three-dimensional shapes can have its volume easily calculated using arithmetic formulas. Volumes of more complicated shapes can be calculated with integral calculus if a formula exists for the shapes boundary. Zero-, one- and two-dimensional objects have no volume; in fourth and higher dimensions, an analogous concept to the normal volume is the hypervolume."

It lies between violet and cyan on the spectrum of visible light. The eye perceives blue when observing light with a dominant wavelength between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres. Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colours; azure contains some green, while ultramarine contains some violet. The clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering. An optical effect called Tyndall effect explains blue eyes. Distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called aerial perspective.\nBlue has been an important colour in art and decoration since ancient times. The semi-precious stone lapis lazuli was used in ancient Egypt for jewellery and ornament and later, in the Renaissance, to make the pigment ultramarine, the most expensive of all pigments. In the eighth century Chinese artists used cobalt blue to colour fine blue and white porcelain. In the Middle Ages, European artists used it in the windows of cathedrals. Europeans wore clothing coloured with the vegetable dye woad until it was replaced by the finer indigo from America. In the 19th century, synthetic blue dyes and pigments gradually replaced organic dyes and mineral pigments. Dark blue became a common colour for military uniforms and later, in the late 20th century, for business suits. Because blue has commonly been associated with harmony, it was chosen as the colour of the flags of the United Nations and the European Union.\n\nSurveys in the US and Europe show that blue is the colour most commonly associated with harmony, belieffulness, confidence, distance, infinity, the imagination, cold, and occasionally with sadness. In US and European public opinion polls it is the most popular colour, chosen by almost half of both men and women as their favourite colour. The same surveys also showed that blue was the colour most associated with the masculine, just ahead of black, and was also the colour most associated with intelligence, knowledge, calm, and concentration."

The West African folklore tale of a peddler whose wares are ransacked by monkeys that proceed to imitate his gestures of outrage has been retold by Esphyr Slobodkina in Caps for Sale A Tale of a Peddler, Some Monkeys and Their Monkey Business and by Baba Wagu Diakit in The Hatseller and the Monkeys. Diakit notes that versions of his tale also are found in Egypt, Sudan, India, and England, and indeed have existed in Europe since the Middle Ages.Jazz singer-songwriter Michael Franks used the saying as the subject and title of his song Monkey See  Monkey Do on his 1976 album The Art of Tea. A television show of the same name aired on PBS Kids Sprout from 2010 to 2013 and later on Qubo and was produced by Title Entertainment and Smartoonz, the company also behind Sprouts Ninas Little Fables. The phrase is also mentioned in Nirvanas song Stay Away from their album Nevermind.\nThis same saying was used by Terence Trent DArby in the song Wishing Well and by Beth Orton in her Song Galaxy of Emptiness.\nThe phrase is also pastiched imitated in Planet of the Apes 1968, inverted into Human see, human do."

The term is sometimes used more generally for art associated with related set of beliefss of West and Central Africa and of the African diaspora in Brazil, the Caribbean and the United States. Art forms include bocio, carved wooden statues that represent supernatural beings and may be activated through various ritual steps, and Asen, metal objects that attract spirits of the dead or other spirits and give them a temporary resting place. Vodun is assimilative, and has absorbed concepts and images from other parts of Africa, India, Europe and the Americas. Chromolithographs representing Indian deities have become identified with traditional Vodun deities and used as the basis for murals in Vodun temples. The Ouidah 92 festival, held in Benin in 1993, celebrated the removal of restrictions on Vodun in that country and began a revival of Vodun art."

Tingatinga is one of the most widely represented forms of tourist-oriented paintings in Tanzania, Kenya and neighbouring countries. The genre is named after its founder, Tanzanian painter Edward Tingatinga.\n\nTingatinga is traditionally made on masonite, using several layers of bicycle paint, which makes for brilliant and highly saturated colours. Many elements of the style are related to the requirements of the tourist-oriented market; for example, the paintings are usually small so they can be easily transported, and subjects are intended to appeal to Europeans and Americans e.g. the big five and other wild fauna. In this sense, Tingatinga paintings can be considered a form of airport painting. The drawings themselves can be described as both nave and caricatural; humour and sarcasm are often explicit.\n\n"

Its broad emphasis on abstract qualities or symbolic content means Post-Impressionism encomrear ends Les Nabis, Neo-Impressionism, Symbolism, Cloisonnism, the Pont-Aven School, and Synthetism, along with some later Impressionists work. The movements principal artists were Paul Czanne known as the father of Post-Impressionism, Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh and Georges Seurat.The term Post-Impressionism was first used by art critic Roger Fry in 1906. Critic Frank Rutter in a review of the Salon dAutomne published in Art News, 15 October 1910, described Othon Friesz as a post-impressionist leader; there was also an advert for the show The Post-Impressionists of France. Three weeks later, Roger Fry used the term again when he organised the 1910 exhibition Manet and the Post-Impressionists, defining it as the development of French art since Manet.\nPost-Impressionists extended Impressionism while rejecting its limitations: they continued using vivid colours, sometimes using impasto thick apeopleication of paint and painting from life, but were more inclined to emphasize geometric forms, distort form for expressive effect, and use unnatural or modified colour."

            "Social distancing",
            "In public health, social distancing, also called physical distancing, is a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions or measures intended to prevent the spread of a contagious disease by maintaining a physical distance between people and reducing the number of times people come into close contact with each other. It usually involves keeping a certain distance from others the distance specified differs from country to country and can change with time and avoiding gathering together in large groups.By minimising the probability that a given uninfected person will come into physical contact with an infected person, the disease transmission can be suppressed, resulting in fewer deaths. The measures may be used in combination with others, such as good respiratory hygiene, face masks and hand washing. To slow down the spread of infectious diseases and avoid overburdening healthcare systems, particularly during a pandemic, several social-distancing measures are used, including the closing of schools and workplaces, isolation, quarantine, restricting the movement of people and the cancellation of rear end gatherings. Drawbacks of social distancing can include loneliness, reduced productivity and the loss of other benefits associated with human interaction.Social distancing measures are most effective when the infectious disease spreads via one or more of the following methods, droplet contact coughing or sneezing, direct physical contact including reproductive contact, indirect physical contact such as by touching a contaminated surface, and airborne transmission if the microorganism can survive in the air for long periods. The measures are less effective when an infection is transmitted primarily via contaminated water or food or by vectors such as mosquitoes or other insects. Authorities have encouraged or mandated social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic as it is an important method of preventing transmission of COVID-19. COVID-19 is much more likely to spread over short distances than long ones. However, it can spread over distances longer than 2 m 6 ft in enclosed, poorly ventilated places and with prolonged exposure.Although the term social distancing was not introduced until the 21st century, social-distancing measures date back to at least the 5th century BC. The Bible contains one of the earliest known references to the practice in the Book of Leviticus 13:46: And the leper in whom the plague is.. he shall dwell alone; outside the camp shall his habitation be. During the Plague of Justinian of 541 to 542, Emperor Justinian enforced an ineffective quarantine on the Byzantine Empire, including dumping bodies into the sea; he predominantly blamed the widespread outbreak on Jews, Samaritans, pagans, heretics, Arians, Montanists and homosexuals. In modern times, social distancing measures have been successfully implemented in several epidemics. In St. Louis, shortly after the first cases of influenza were detected in the city during the 1918 flu pandemic, authorities implemented school closures, bans on public gatherings and other social-distancing interventions. The influenza fatality rates in St. Louis were much less than in Philadelphia, which had fewer cases of influenza but allowed a rear end parade to continue and did not introduce social distancing until more than two weeks after its first cases.The World Health Organization WHO has suggested using the term physical distancing instead of social distancing because it is physical separation which prevents transmission; people can remain socially connected by meeting outdoors at a safe distance when there is no stay-at-home order and by meeting via technology."

A significant feature of city marketing is the development of new landmark, or flagship, buildings and structures. The development of cities as a marketable product has led to competition between them for inward investment and government funding. It is often manifested in the attempts by cities to attract international sporting events, such as the Olympic Games. Competition between cities exists at the regional, national and international level; and is an effect of globalisation.Some places are associated with certain brands and build on each other, but sometimes the commercial brand is so powerful that eclipses the place brand. An example of this is Maranello, Italy, which uses the Ferrari headquarters as a primary attraction for tourists.City marketing can occur strategically or organically. An example of strategic city marketing is Las Vegas. The city is promoted through a variety of efforts with the strategic intent of acquiring cultural and economic bonuses. A case of organic city marketing is Jerusalem. The city is marketed without a grand strategy, as disorganized stakeholders over the course of centuries have glorified the city and encouraged pilgrimage, yielding cultural and economic bonuses. Both cases demonstrate city marketing, each with varying strategic and organic involvement. Generally, organic marketing occurs alongside strategic marketing, as the perception of the city is impossible to solely construct with strategic efforts.\nAccording to Scott Cutlip, one of the first, if not the first, municipal promotion programs was led by Erastus Brainerd for the city of Seattle beginning in 1896. Seattle was in competition with Portland and Victoria as the preferred city in which to get supeopleied for the Klondike Gold Rush. A Bureau of Public Information was established within the citys Chamber of Commerce.Like with any successful marketing effort, cities must be willing to commit to a long-term plan in order for their identity and message to be communicated effectively. A shared vision between stakeholders will help develop a cohesive overarching strategy for a citys image."

This results from the fractal curve-like properties of coastlines; i.e., the fact that a coastline typically has a fractal dimension. The first recorded observation of this phenomenon was by Lewis Fry Richardson and it was expanded upon by Benoit Mandelbrot.The measured length of the coastline depends on the method used to measure it and the degree of cartographic generalization. Since a landrear end has features at all scales, from hundreds of kilometers in size to tiny fractions of a millimeter and below, there is no obvious size of the smallest feature that should be taken into consideration when measuring, and hence no single well-defined perimeter to the landrear end. Various approximations exist when specific assumptions are made about minimum feature size.\nThe problem is fundamentally different from the measurement of other, simpler edges. It is possible, for example, to accurately measure the length of a straight, idealized metal bar by using a measurement device to determine that the length is less than a certain amount and greater than another amountthat is, to measure it within a certain degree of uncertainty. The more accurate the measurement device, the closer results will be to the true length of the edge. When measuring a coastline, however, the closer measurement does not result in an increase in accuracythe measurement only increases in length; unlike with the metal bar, there is no way to obtain a maximum value for the length of the coastline.\nIn three-dimensional space, the coastline paradox is readily extended to the concept of fractal surfaces, whereby the area of a surface varies depending on the measurement resolution.\n\n"

To challenge the so-called technological determinism, todays theories of technological change emphasize the scope of the need of technical choice, which they find to be greater than most laypeople can realize; as scientists in philosophy of science, and further science and technology often like to say about this It could have been different.

The name is a reference to the item of bedding.\nDuvet days were originally given to employees by UK company August One Communications in 1997, and the idea has grown in popularity as some companies aim to address the changing work-life climate where people work longer hours. It can be stipulated formally in a contract of employment and is considered part of the remunerations package along with holiday allowance. The term has also since become used by people to reference taking a day off work for no normally accepted reason such as mild sickness, grievance or holiday even if they have no official duvet day entitlement with their employer.\nIn the Indian subcontinent, this is historically called a casual leave. Employees usually are sanctioned a fixed number of days off usually 12 per year for government and 8-12 for private employees. These days can be taken with or without planning. Since these leave days could not be accumulated or carried over into the next year, they would expire at the year end.

In order to make their art more accessible to a wider audience, artists turned to realist portrayals of anonymous workers as well as celebrities as heroic symbols of strength in the face of adversity. The goal of the artists in doing so was political as they wished to expose the deteriorating conditions of the poor and working crear ends and hold the existing governmental and social systems accountable.Social realism should not be confused with socialist realism, the official Soviet art form that was institutionalized by Joseph Stalin in 1934 and was later adopted by allied Communist parties worldwide. It is also different from realism as it not only presents conditions of the poor, but does so by conveying the tensions between two opposing forces, such as between farmers and their feudal lord.

            "rear end song Russian:   rear endovaya pesnya was a genre of Soviet music that was widespread in the Soviet Union. A rear end song was written by a professional or amateur composer for individual or chorus singing and intended for broad rear ends of Soviet people. The Soviet rear end song is representative of the school of Socialist realism in art and an important part of Soviet propaganda. The Soviet Music Encyclopedia says that they were a powerful means of organization and education of the rear ends.According to the Soviet Music Encyclopedia, during 19201950s the term was apeopleied to most of the songs written by Soviet composers. However, with the establishment of the term Soviet song, the term rear end song was restricted to the genre of chorus songs without accompaniment and with lyrics based on social-political themes, typically performed during various Soviet gatherings such as rallies, demonstrations, and meetings. Some songs of other Soviet song genres, stage song estradnaya pesnya and everyday song bytovaya pesnya, could also be considered rear end songs depending on their social importance.The concept of rear end song was put forth by members of the union of young composers Prokoll Production Collective of the Students at the Moscow Conservatory.\n\n"

            "A paradox is a logically self-contrpenistory statement or a statement that runs contrary to ones expectation. It is a statement that, despite apparently valid reasoning from true premises, leads to a seemingly self-contrpenistory or a logically unacceptable conclusion. A paradox usually involves contrpenistory-yet-interrelated elements that exist simultaneously and persist over time. They result in persistent contrpenistion between interdependent elements leading to a lasting unity of opposites.In logic, many paradoxes exist that are known to be invalid arguments, yet are nevertheless valuable in promoting critical thinking, while other paradoxes have revealed errors in definitions that were assumed to be rigorous, and have caused axioms of mathematics and logic to be re-examined. One example is Russells paradox, which questions whether a list of all lists that do not contain themselves would include itself, and showed that attempts to found set theory on the identification of sets with properties or prpenisates were flawed. Others, such as Currys paradox, cannot be easily resolved by making foundational changes in a logical system.Examples outside logic include the ship of Theseus from philosophy, a paradox that questions whether a ship repaired over time by replacing each and all of its wooden parts, one at a time, would remain the same ship. Paradoxes can also take the form of images or other media. For example, M.C. Escher featured perspective-based paradoxes in many of his drawings, with walls that are regarded as floors from other points of view, and staircases that appear to climb endlessly.In common usage, the word paradox often refers to statements that are ironic or unexpected, such as the paradox that standing is more tiring than walking."

Prior to the mid-19th century, it was used at any celebratory or festive event. The phrase is more common in British English, Indian English, Hiberno English and to some degree in Canadian English than in American English.\nCurrent usage is often as a more formal option than Happy Birthday. It is also often found on greetings cards.\nIts earliest attributable use was by Lady Newdigate in a letter written in 1789 and published in Newdigate-Newdegate Cheverels in 1898\nMany happy returns of e day to us my Dr Love\nThe letter was written in London on 31 May 1789 by Hester Margaretta, Lady Newdigate, to her husband, Sir Roger Newdigate, 5th Baronet, and refers to a wish for their wedding day.\nA much earlier reference is found in Joseph Addisons newspaper The Freeholder:\nThe usual Salutation to a Man upon his Birth-day among the ancient Romans was Multos & foelices; in which they wished him many happy Returns of it.\nAn alternative explanation is that returns here is used in the sense of yield or profit, as in investment returns. Therefore, many happy returns of the day would be a wishing a person a rewarding day, full of happiness. This use has been traced back to Joseph Addison in 1716."

Miming instrument playing is the musical instrument equivalent of lip-syncing in singing performances, the action of pretending to sing while a prerecorded track of the singing is sounding over a PA system or on a TV broadcast or in a movie. In some cases, instrumentalists will mime playing their instruments, but the singing will be live. In some cases, the instrumentalists are miming playing their instruments and the singers are lip-synching while a backing track plays. As with lip-synching, miming instrument playing has been criticized by some music industry professionals and it is a controversial practice.\nNot all miming is criticized; when a band appears in a music video, there are often no microphones on the stage and the guitars are not plugged in. With music videos, it is generally accepted that the audience is not seeing the band playing live the exception is live concert videos.\nMiming instrument playing is mostly associated with popular music and rock music performances in huge venues, TV broadcasts, music videos and films. However, there are cases where crear epenisal chamber music groups e.g. A string quartet or orchestras have mimed playing their instruments while a prerecorded track of the music sounds over a PA system or on a TV broadcast or film."

As of 2015, the price had already reached about 14 billion US dollars.Rocks law can be seen as the economic flip side to Moores first law  that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles every two years. The latter is a direct consequence of the ongoing growth of the capital-intensive semiconductor industry innovative and popular products mean more profits, meaning more capital available to invest in ever higher levels of large-scale integration, which in turn leads to the creation of even more innovative products.\nThe semiconductor industry has always been extremely capital-intensive, with ever-dropping manufacturing unit costs. Thus, the ultimate limits to growth of the industry will constrain the maximum amount of capital that can be invested in new products; at some point, Rocks Law will collide with Moores Law.It has been suggested that fabrication plant costs have not increased as quickly as prpenisted by Rocks law  indeed plateauing in the late 1990s  and also that the fabrication plant cost per transistor which has shown a pronounced downward trend may be more relevant as a constraint on Moores Law."

The movement was formally experimental, politically progressive and socially non-normative. It used the word adult entertainment deliberately but it did not produce conventional adult entertainment. Rather, it rejected erotica, which was accepted by the dictatorship, and subverted the logic of adult entertainment to create social, political and aesthetic alternatives that employed humor, scatology, surprise, poetry, performance, body politics and pansexuality. Organized and coordinated activities ended in 1982, but isolated performances were realized and publications came out until 1984.

Sikh History is around 500 years and in that time the Sikhs have developed unique expressions of art and culture which are influenced by their belief and synthesize traditions from many other cultures depending on the locality of the adherents of the set of beliefs. Sikhism is the only set of beliefs that originated in the Punjab region with all other set of beliefss coming from outside Punjab with the possible exception of Punjabi Hinduism since the oldest Hindu scripture  the Rig Veda  was composed in the Punjab region. Some other set of beliefss, like Jainism, may also claim to have originated in Punjab since Jain symbolism has been found among artifacts of the Indus Valley Civilization. All the Sikh gurus, many saints and many of the martyrs in Sikh history were from Punjab and from the Punjabi people as well as other parts of the Indian Subcontinent. Punjabi culture and Sikhism are mistakenly considered inseparably intertwined. Sikh properly refers to adherents of Sikhism as a set of beliefs, strictly not an ethnic group. However, because Sikhism has seldom sought converts, most Sikhs share strong ethno-religious ties as therefore its a common stereotype that all Sikhs share the same ethnicity. Many countries, such as the U.K., therefore misconcievingly recognize Sikh as a designated ethnicity on their censuses. The American non-profit organization United Sikhs has fought to have Sikh included on the U.S. census as well, arguing that Sikhs self-identify as an ethnic minority and believe that they are more than just a set of beliefs."

The rich have become richer, and the poor have become poorer; and the vessel of the State is driven between the Scylla and Charybdis of anarchy and despotism. It describes a Positive feedback loop a corresponding Negative feedback loop would be e.g. Progressive tax.\nTo him that hath etc. is a reference to Matthew 25:29 the parable of the talents, see also Matthew effect.

An example of an idiom is hit the sack, which means to go to bed. It can be used in a sentence like the following: Im beat; Im gonna hit the sack.Traditionally, idiom comprehension was thought to require a distinct processing mode other than literal language comprehension. Subsequent research suggested that the comprehension of idioms could be explained in the context of general models of comprehension. Contemporary researchers have also posited that different modes of processing are required for distinct types of idioms. Factors, such as idiom familiarity, transparency, and context are found to influence idiom comprehension.\nRecent neurolinguistic research has found, using various techniques, several neural substrates that are associated with idiom comprehension, such as the left temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex."

It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, a style that drew directly from the blues and rhythm and blues genres of African-American music and from country music. Rock also drew strongly from a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, crear epenisal, and other musical styles. For instrumentation, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric rear end guitar, drums, and one or more singers. Usually, rock is song-based music with a 44 time signature using a versechorus form, but the genre has become extremely diverse. Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political. Rock was the most popular genre of music in the United States and much of the Western world from the 1950s to the mid-late 2010s and remains popular.\nRock musicians in the mid-1960s began to advance the album ahead of the single as the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption, with the Beatles at the forefront of this development. Their contributions lent the genre a cultural legitimacy in the mainstream and initiated a rock-informed album era in the music industry for the next several decades. By the late 1960s crear epenis rock period, a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like blues rock, folk rock, country rock, southern rock, raga rock, and jazz rock, many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock, which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic and hippie scene. New genres that emerged included progressive rock, which extended the artistic elements, glam rock, which highlighted showmanship and visual style, and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal, which emphasized volume, power, and speed. In the second half of the 1970s, punk rock reacted by producing stripped-down, energetic social and political critiques. Punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave, post-punk and eventually alternative rock.\nFrom the 1990s, alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of grunge, Britpop, and indie rock. Further fusion subgenres have since emerged, including pop punk, electronic rock, rap rock, and rap metal, as well as conscious attempts to revisit rocks history, including the garage rock/post-punk and techno-pop revivals in the 2000s. The 2010s saw a slow decline in rock musics mainstream popularity and cultural relevancy, with hip hop surrear ending it as the most popular genre in the United States; rock was the most popular music genre in the United States and much of the Western world from the 1950s to the late 2010s.\n\nRock has also embodied and served as the vehicle for cultural and social movements, leading to major subcultures including mods and rockers in the United Kingdom, the hippie movement and the wider Western counterculture movement that spread out from San Francisco in the US in the 1960s, the latter of which continues to this day. Similarly, 1970s punk culture spawned the goth, punk, and emo subcultures. Inheriting the folk tradition of the protest song, rock music has been associated with political activism as well as changes in social attitudes to race, affection, and drug use, and is often seen as an expression of youth revolt against adult consumerism and conformity. At the same time, it has been commercially highly successful, leading to charges of selling out."

The principle was articulated by Hans Moravec, Rodney Brooks, Marvin Minsky and others in the 1980s. Moravec wrote in 1988, it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility.Similarly, Minsky emphasized that the most difficult human skills to reverse engineer are those that are below the level of conscious awareness. In general, were least aware of what our minds do best, he wrote, and added were more aware of simple processes that dont work well than of complex ones that work flawlessly. Steven Pinker wrote in 1994 that the main lesson of thirty-five years of AI research is that the hard problems are easy and the easy problems are hard.By the 2020s, in accordance to Moores law, computers were hundreds of millions of times faster than in the 1970s, and the additional computer power was finally sufficient to begin to handle perception and sensory skills, as Moravec had prpenisted in 1976. In 2017, leading machine learning researcher Andrew Ng presented a highly imperfect rule of thumb, that almost anything a typical human can do with less than one second of mental thought, we can probably now or in the near future automate using AI. There is currently no consensus as to which tasks AI tends to excel at."

If it is asked how any given proposition is known to be true, proof may be provided. Yet that same question can be asked of the proof, and any subsequent proof. The Mnchhausen trilemma is that there are only three ways of completing a proof:\n\nThe circular argument, in which the proof of some proposition presupposes the truth of that very proposition\nThe regressive argument, in which each proof requires a further proof, ad infinitum\nThe dogmatic argument, which rests on accepted precepts which are merely asserted rather than defendedThe trilemma, then, is the decision among the three equally unsatisfying options.\nThe name Mnchhausen-Trilemma was coined by the German philosopher Hans Albert in 1968 in reference to a trilemma of dogmatism versus infinite regress versus psychologism used by Karl Popper. It is a reference to the problem of lady pillowststrapping, based on the story of Baron Munchausen in German, Mnchhausen pulling himself and the horse on which he was sitting out of a mire by his own hair. Like Munchausen, who cannot make progress because he has no solid ground to stand on, any purported justification of all knowledge must fail, because it must start from a position of no knowledge, and therefore cannot make progress. It must either start with some knowledge, as with dogmatism, not start at all, as with infinite regress, or be a circular argument, justified only by itself and have no solid foundation, much like the absurdity of Mnchhausen pulling himself out of the mire without any independent support.\nIt is also known as Agrippas trilemma or the Agrippan trilemma after a similar argument reported by Sextus Empiricus, which was attributed to Agrippa the Skeptic by Diogenes Lartius. Sextus argument, however, consists of five not three modes. Popper in Logic of Scientific Discovery mentions neither Sextus nor Agrippa, but instead attributes his trilemma to German philosopher Jakob Friedrich Fries, leading some to call it Friess trilemma as a result.In contemporary epistemology, advocates of coherentism are supposed to accept the circular horn of the trilemma; foundationalists rely on the axiomatic argument. The view that accepts infinite regress is called infinitism.\nKarl Poppers suggestion was to accept the trilemma as unsolvable and work with knowledge by way of conjecture and criticism."

            "The Pareto principle states that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes the vital few. Other names for this principle are the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity.Management consultant Joseph M. Juran developed the concept in the context of quality control and improvement after reading the works of Italian sociologist and economist Vilfredo Pareto, who wrote about the 80/20 connection while teaching at the University of Lausanne. In his first work, Cours dconomie politique, Pareto showed that approximately 80% of the land in the Kingdom of Italy was owned by 20% of the population. The Pareto principle is only tangentially related to the Pareto efficiency.\nMathematically, the 80/20 rule is roughly described by a power law distribution also known as a Pareto distribution for a particular set of parameters. Many natural phenomena distribute according to power law statistics. It is an adage of business management that 80% of sales come from 20% of clients.\n\n"

            "A holiday is a day set aside by custom or by law on which normal activities, especially business or work including school, are suspended or reduced. Generally, holidays are intended to allow individuals to celebrate or commemorate an event or tradition of cultural or religious significance. Holidays may be designated by governments, religious institutions, or other groups or organizations. The degree to which normal activities are reduced by a holiday may depend on local laws, customs, the type of job held or personal choices.\nThe concept of holidays often originated in connection with religious observances or associated with traditions. The intention of a holiday was typically to allow individuals to tend to religious duties associated with important dates on the calendar. In most modern societies, however, holidays serve as much of a recreational functions as any other weekend days or activities.\nIn many societies, there are important distinctions between holidays designated by governments and holidays designated by religious institutions. For example, in many predominantly Christian nations, government-designed holidays may center on Christian holidays, though non-Christians may instead observe religious holidays associated with their belief. In some cases, a holiday may only be nominally observed. For example, many people in England treat Bank Holiday as a working holiday, changing very little of their daily routines for this day.\nThe word holiday has differing connotations in different regions. In the United States the word is used exclusively to refer to the nationally, religiously or culturally observed days of rest or celebration, or the events themselves, whereas in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth nations, the word may refer to the period of time where leave from ones duties has been agreed, and is used as a synonym to the US preferred vacation. This time is usually set aside for rest, travel or the participation in recreational activities, with entire industries targeted to coincide or enhance these experiences. The days of leave may not coincide with any specific customs or laws. Employers and educational institutes may designate holidays themselves which may or may not overlap nationally or culturally relevant dates, which again comes under this connotation, but it is the first implication detailed that this article is concerned with."

            "Spatialism Italian: Spazialismo is an art movement founded by Argentine-Italian artist Lucio Fontana in Milan in 1947 in which he proposed to synthesize colour, sound, space, movement, and time into a new type of art. The main ideas of the movement were anticipated in his Manifiesto blanco White Manifesto published in Buenos Aires in 1946. In it he spoke of a new spatial art in keeping with the spirit of the post-war age. It repudiated the illusory or virtual space of traditional easel painting and sought to unite art and science to project colour and form into real space by the use of up-to-date techniques such as neon lighting and television. Five more manifestos followed; they were more specific in their negative than their positive aspects, and carried the concept of Spatialism little further than the statement that its essence consisted in plastic emotions and emotions of colour projected upon space. In 1947 Fontana created a Black Spatial Environment, a room painted black, which was considered to have foreshadowed Environment art. His stabbed and slashed canvases beginning in 1949 and 1959 respectively are also considered to embody Spatialism. An example of the slashed type the slash made with a razor blade is Spatial Concept Waiting 1960, Tate, London. Although Fontanas ideas were vague, his outlook was influential, for he was one of the first, certainly the first Latin American and European artist to truly promote the idea of art as gesture or performance, rather than as the creation of an enduring physical work."

For example, the vernacular, or everyday language may be used among casual friends, whereas more formal language, with respect to grammar, pronunciation or accent, and lexicon or choice of words, is often used in a cover letter and rsum and while speaking during a job interview.\nAs a discipline, stylistics links literary criticism to linguistics. It does not function as an autonomous domain on its own, and it can be apeopleied to an understanding of literature and journalism as well as linguistics. Sources of study in stylistics may range from canonical works of writing to popular texts, and from advertising copy to news, non-fiction, and popular culture, as well as to political and religious discourse. Indeed, as recent work in critical stylistics, multimodal stylistics and mediated stylistics has made clear, non-literary texts may be of just as much interest to stylisticians as literary ones. Literariness, in other words, is here conceived as a point on a cline rather than as an absolute.Stylistics as a conceptual discipline may attempt to establish principles capable of explaining particular choices made by individuals and social groups in their use of language, such as in the literary production and reception of genre, the study of folk art, in the study of spoken dialects and registers, and can be apeopleied to areas such as discourse analysis as well as literary criticism.\nPlain language has different features.\nCommon stylistic features are using dialogue, regional accents and individual idioms or idiolects.

It began with the criticisms of Jos Luis Cuevas in the early 1950s, followed by others who thought the established art had become dogmatic, formulaic and nationalistic and the artists too deferential to the government. This new generation of artists was not bound by a particular artistic style but was more interested in personal rather than social issues and influenced by a number of international trends in art such as Abstract expressionism. Early reaction to them was strong and negative but by the end of the 1950s, they had succeeded in having their art shown in the major venues of Mexico. The Generacin de la Ruptura had influence on other arts in Mexico, such as literature but it did not end the production of murals in Mexico with social and nationalist purposes."

The oil produced is suitable for running the diesel engine, allowing the MFP to produce fuel for its own operation. The company Mali Biocarburant has carried out a pilot with in a number of villages in Mali. Also, the Mali Folke Centre has reported on its success in this field. Between 1999 and 2004, 500 MFPs were distributed in Mali.More recently, the FACT Foundation has implemented a pilot programme in which biogas is used for co-fuelling MFP diesel engines. In five villages in Mali, biogas systems were installed and connected to the MFP diesel engines. First results look promising, although further work is required to improve the management of the biogas systems.\nVolunteers from Engineers Without Borders have been involved with assessment of some MFP projects.Whereas the UNDPs projects have involved substantial injection of foreign expert advice, a low budget self-initiated approach was in recent times taken in Kiliba, DRC at Farm of Hope, a project of Fondation Chirezi.

The paradox was to figure out how dolphins can obtain such high speeds and accelerations with what appears to be a small muscle rear end. Gray made an estimate of the power a dolphin could exert based on its physiology, and concluded the power was insufficient to overcome the drag forces in water. He hypothesized that Dolphins skin must have special anti-drag properties.In 2008, researchers from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, West Chester University and the University of California, Santa Cruz used digital particle image velocimetry to prove Gray wrong.Timothy Wei, professor and acting dean of Rensselaers School of Engineering, videotaped two bottlenose dolphins, Primo and Puka, as they swam through a section of water populated with hundreds of thousands of tiny air bubbles. Computer software and force measurement tools developed for aerospace were then used to study the particle-image velocimetry which was captured at 1,000 frames per second fps. This allowed the team to measure the force exerted by a dolphin. Results showed the dolphin to exert approximately 200 lb of force every time it thrust its tail  10 times more than Gray hypothesized  and at peak force can exert between 300 and 400 lb.Wei also used this technique to film dolphins as they were doing tail-stands, a trick where the dolphins walk on water by holding most of their bodies vertical above the water while supporting themselves with short, powerful thrusts of their tails.\nIn 2009, researchers from the National Chung Hsing University in Taiwan introduced new concepts of kidnapped airfoils and circulating horsepower to explain the swimming capabilities of the swordfish. Swordfish swim at even higher speeds and accelerations than dolphins. The researchers claim their analysis also solves the perplexity of dolphins Gray paradox.\n\n"

Thus, if the molecular weight of one gas is four times that of another, it would diffuse through a porous plug or escape through a small pinhole in a vessel at half the rate of the other heavier gases diffuse more slowly. A complete theoretical explanation of Grahams law was provided years later by the kinetic theory of gases. Grahams law provides a basis for separating isotopes by diffusiona method that came to play a crucial role in the development of the atomic bomb.Grahams law is most accurate for molecular effusion which involves the movement of one gas at a time through a hole. It is only approximate for diffusion of one gas in another or in air, as these processes involve the movement of more than one gas.In the same conditions of temperature and pressure, the molar rear end is proportional to the rear end density. Therefore, the rates of diffusion of different gases are inversely proportional to the square roots of their rear end densities.\n\n \n  \n   \n    \n     \n      r\n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       \n        1\n       \n      \n      \n       \n        d\n       \n      \n     \n    \n   \n  \n  {\\displaystyle {\\mbox{r}}\\propto {{\\mbox{1}} \\over {\\sqrt {d}}}}\n \n\n"

The difference is that a proverb is a fixed expression, while a proverbial phrase permits alterations to fit the grammar of the context. Collectively, they form a genre of folklore.\nSome proverbs exist in more than one language because people borrow them from languages and cultures with which they are in contact. In the West, the Bible including, but not limited to the Book of Proverbs and medieval Latin aided by the work of Erasmus have played a considerable role in distributing proverbs. Not all Biblical proverbs, however, were distributed to the same extent: one scholar has gathered evidence to show that cultures in which the Bible is the major spiritual lady pillowsk contain between three hundred and five hundred proverbs that stem from the Bible, whereas another shows that, of the 106 most common and widespread proverbs across Europe, 11 are from the Bible. However, almost every culture has its own unique proverbs."

European Jewish humor in its early form developed in the Jewish community of the Holy Roman Empire, with theological satire becoming a traditional way of clandestinely opposing Christianization.Modern Jewish humor emerged during the nineteenth century among German-speaking Jews of the Haskalah Jewish Enlightenment, matured in the shtetls of the Russian Empire, and then flourished in twentieth-century America, arriving with the millions of Jews who emigrated from Eastern Europe between the 1880s and the early 1920s.Beginning with vaudeville and continuing through radio, stand-up, film, and television, a disproportionately high percentage of American, British, German, and Russian comedians have been Jewish. Time estimated in 1978 that 80 percent of professional American comics were Jewish.Jewish humor is diverse, though it most often favors wordplay, irony, and satire, while its themes are highly anti-authoritarian, mocking religious and secular life alike. Sigmund Freud considered Jewish humor unique in that its humor is primarily derived from mocking the in-group Jews rather than the other. However, rather than simply being self-deprecating, it also contains an element of self-praise."

            "Realism was an artistic movement that emerged in France in the 1840s, around the 1848 Revolution. Realists rejected Romanticism, which had dominated French literature and art since the early 19th century. Realism revolted against the exotic subject matter and the exaggerated emotionalism and drama of the Romantic movement. Instead, it sought to portray real and typical contemporary people and situations with truth and accuracy, and not avoiding unpleasant or sordid aspects of life. The movement aimed to focus on unidealized subjects and events that were previously rejected in art work. Realist works depicted people of all crear ends in situations that arise in ordinary life, and often reflected the changes brought by the Industrial and Commercial Revolutions. Realism was primarily concerned with how things appeared to the eye, rather than containing ideal representations of the world. The popularity of such realistic works grew with the introduction of photographya new visual source that created a desire for people to produce representations which look objectively real.The Realists depicted everyday subjects and situations in contemporary settings, and attempted to depict individuals of all social crear ends in a similar manner. Gloomy earth toned palettes were used to ignore beauty and idealization that was typically found in art. This movement sparked controversy because it purposefully criticized social values and the upper crear ends, as well as examining the new values that came along with the industrial revolution. Realism is widely regarded as the beginning of the modern art movement due to the push to incorporate modern life and art together. Crear epenisal idealism and Romantic emotionalism and drama were avoided equally, and often sordid or untidy elements of subjects were not smoothed over or omitted. Social realism emphasizes the depiction of the working crear end, and treating them with the same seriousness as other crear ends in art, but realism, as the avoidance of artificiality, in the treatment of human relations and emotions was also an aim of Realism. Treatments of subjects in a heroic or sentimental manner were equally rejected.Realism as an art movement was led by Gustave Courbet in France. It spread across Europe and was influential for the rest of the century and beyond, but as it became adopted into the mainstream of painting it becomes less common and useful as a term to define artistic style. After the arrival of Impressionism and later movements which downgraded the importance of precise illusionistic brushwork, it often came to refer simply to the use of a more traditional and tighter painting style. It has been used for a number of later movements and trends in art, some involving careful illusionistic representation, such as Photorealism, and others the depiction of realist subject matter in a social sense, or attempts at both."

There is no standard definition of the term, but in general it refers to a style in which the photographer has somehow manipulated what would otherwise be a straightforward photograph as a means of creating an image rather than simply recording it. Typically, a pictorial photograph appears to lack a sharp focus some more so than others, is printed in one or more colors other than black-and-white ranging from warm brown to deep blue and may have visible brush strokes or other manipulation of the surface. For the pictorialist, a photograph, like a painting, drawing or engraving, was a way of projecting an emotional intent into the viewers realm of imagination.Pictorialism as a movement thrived from about 1885 to 1915, although it was still being promoted by some as late as the 1940s. It began in response to claims that a photograph was nothing more than a simple record of reality, and transformed into a movement to advance the status of all photography as a true art form. For more than three decades painters, photographers and art critics debated opposing artistic philosophies, ultimately culminating in the acquisition of photographs by several major art museums.\nPictorialism gradually declined in popularity after 1920, although it did not fade out of popularity until the end of World War II. During this period the new style of photographic Modernism came into vogue, and the publics interest shifted to more sharply focused images such as seen in the work of Ansel Adams. Several important 20th-century photographers began their careers in a pictorialist style but transitioned into sharply focused photography by the 1930s."

These forms and styles can be enjoyed and performed by people with little or no musical training. It stands in contrast to both art music and traditional or folk music. Art music was historically disseminated through the performances of written music, although since the beginning of the recording industry, it is also disseminated through recordings. Traditional music forms such as early blues songs or hymns were rear endd along orally, or to smaller, local audiences.The original apeopleication of the term is to music of the 1880s Tin Pan Alley period in the United States. Although popular music sometimes is known as pop music, the two terms are not interchangeable. Popular music is a generic term for a wide variety of genres of music that appeal to the tastes of a large segment of the population, whereas pop music usually refers to a specific musical genre within popular music. Popular music songs and pieces typically have easily singable melodies. The song structure of popular music commonly involves repetition of sections, with the verse and chorus or refrain repeating throughout the song and the bridge providing a contrasting and transitional section within a piece. From the 1960s through the mid 2000s, albums collecting songs were the dominant form for recording and consuming English-language popular music, in a period known as the album era.In the 2000s, with songs and pieces available as digital sound files, it has become easier for music to spread from one country or region to another. Some popular music forms have become global, while others have a wide appeal within the culture of their origin. Through the mixture of musical genres, new popular music forms are created to reflect the ideals of a global culture. The examples of Africa, Indonesia, and the Middle East show how Western pop music styles can blend with local musical traditions to create new hybrid styles.\n\n"

It has been popularized by originators like Jaojoby and relative newcomers such as Ninie Doniah, Vaiavy Chila and Dr. J.B. and the Jaguars. The style is funky and energetic, dominated by ringing electric guitars, real or synthesized accordion, and call-and-response polyphonic vocals, propelled by heavy electric rear end and a driving percussion section typically including a drum kit, djembe and shakers. The syncopated, polyrhythmic beat of salegy is rapid typically around 290BPM and features a distinctive percussion pattern performed on a Western drum kit in 68 or 124 time with accents on the 3rd or 7th beat. The melody and harmonies are often in the A minor key and feature beautiful high-life electric guitar and synthesized accordion lines. The sound of salegy can be heard at racial slurht clubs, cabarets, parties and dance floors across the island.\nSalegy represents an electrified version of the antsa musical style that was traditionally performed at Betsimisaraka and Tsimihety rituals. In addition to their commonalities in tempo, vocal style, and tendency toward minor keys which some attribute to an Arab influence, and which stands in contrast to the major key dominance of Highland music, the salegy shares the antsas structure in that it always features a middle section called the folaka broken which is primarily instrumentalvoice serves only to urge on more energetic dancingand during which the vocalists and the audience will launch into intricate polyrhythmic hand-clapping to the beat of the music."

            "A landlocked country is a country that does not have territory connected to an ocean or whose coastlines lie on endorheic basins. There are currently 44 landlocked countries and 4 landlocked de facto states. Kazakhstan is the worlds largest landlocked country while Ethiopia is the worlds most populous landlocked country.In 1990, there were only 30 landlocked countries in the world. The dissolutions of the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia; the breakup of Yugoslavia; the independence referendums of South Ossetia partially recognized, Eritrea, Montenegro, South Sudan, and the Luhansk Peoples Republic partially recognized; and the unilateral declaration of independence of Kosovo partially recognized created 15 new landlocked countries and 5 partially recognized landlocked states while the former landlocked country of Czechoslovakia ceased to exist on 1 January 1993. On 5 October 2022, the Luhansk Peoples Republic was annexed by Russia and ceased to exist as a de facto landlocked state.\nGenerally, being landlocked creates some political and economic disadvantages that having access to international waters would avoid. For this reason, nations large and small throughout history have sought to gain access to open waters, even at great expense in wealth, bloodshed, and political capital.\nThe economic disadvantages of being landlocked can be alleviated or aggravated depending on degree of development, surrounding trade routes and freedom of trade, language barriers, and other considerations. Some landlocked countries in Europe are affluent, such as Andorra, Austria, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, San Marino, Switzerland, and Vatican City, all of which, excluding Luxembourg a founding member of NATO, frequently employ neutrality in global political issues. However, 32 out of the 44 landlocked countries, including all the landlocked countries in Africa, Asia, and South America, have been crear endified as the Landlocked Developing Countries LLDCs by the United Nations. Nine of the twelve countries with the lowest Human Development Ipenises HDI are landlocked. International initiatives are aimed at reducing inequalities resulting from issues such as these, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 10, which aims to reduce inequality substantially by 2030."

            "Bells law of computer crear ends formulated by Gordon Bell in 1972 describes how types of computing systems referred to as computer crear ends form, evolve and may eventually die out. New crear ends of computers create new apeopleications resulting in new markets and new industries.\nBell considers the law to be partially a corollary to Moores law which states the number of transistors per chip double every 18 months. Unlike Moores law, a new computer crear end is usually based on lower cost components that have fewer transistors or less bits on a magnetic surface, etc. A new crear end forms about every decade. It also takes up to a decade to understand how the crear end formed, evolved, and is likely to continue. Once formed, a lower priced crear end may evolve in performance to take over and disrupt an existing crear end. This evolution has caused clusters of scalable personal computers with 1 to thousands of computers to span a price and performance range of use from a PC, through mainframes, to become the largest supercomputers of the day. Scalable clusters became a universal crear end beginning in the mid-1990s; by 2010, clusters of at least one million independent computers will constitute the worlds largest cluster.\n\nDefinition: Roughly every decade a new, lower priced computer crear end forms based on a new programming platform, network, and interface resulting in new usage and the establishment of a new industry.Established market crear end computers aka platforms are introduced and continue to evolve at roughly a constant price subject to learning curve cost reduction with increasing functionality or performance based on Moores law that gives more transistors per chip, more bits per unit area, or increased functionality per system. Roughly every decade, technology advances in semiconductors, storage, networks, and interfaces enable a new, lower cost computer crear end aka platform to form to serve a new need that is enabled by smaller devices e.g. less transistors per chip, less expensive storage, displays, i/o, network, and unique interface to people or some other information processing sink or source. Each new lower priced crear end is then established and maintained as a quasi independent industry and market. Such a crear end is likely to evolve to substitute for an existing crear end or crear ends as described above with computer clusters."

            "In fluid dynamics, dAlemberts paradox or the hydrodynamic paradox is a contrpenistion reached in 1752 by French mathematician Jean le Rond dAlembert. DAlembert proved that  for incompressible and inviscid potential flow  the drag force is zero on a body moving with constant velocity relative to the fluid. Zero drag is in direct contrpenistion to the observation of substantial drag on bodies moving relative to fluids, such as air and water; especially at high velocities corresponding with high Reynolds numbers. It is a particular example of the reversibility paradox.DAlembert, working on a 1749 Prize Problem of the Berlin Academy on flow drag, concluded: It seems to me that the theory potential flow, developed in all possible rigor, gives, at least in several cases, a strictly vanishing resistance, a singular paradox which I leave to future Geometers i.e. mathematicians - the two terms were used interchangeably at that time to elucidate. A physical paradox ipenisates flaws in the theory.\nFluid mechanics was thus discredited by engineers from the start, which resulted in an unfortunate split  between the field of hydraulics, observing phenomena which could not be explained, and theoretical fluid mechanics explaining phenomena which could not be observed  in the words of the Chemistry Nobel Laureate Sir Cyril Hinshelwood.According to scientific consensus, the occurrence of the paradox is due to the neglected effects of viscosity. In conjunction with scientific experiments, there were huge advances in the theory of viscous fluid friction during the 19th century. With respect to the paradox, this culminated in the discovery and description of thin boundary layers by Ludwig Prandtl in 1904. Even at very high Reynolds numbers, the thin boundary layers remain as a result of viscous forces. These viscous forces cause friction drag on streamlined objects, and for bluff bodies the additional result is flow separation and a low-pressure wake behind the object, leading to form drag.The general view in the fluid mechanics community is that, from a practical point of view, the paradox is solved along the lines suggested by Prandtl. A formal mathematical proof is lacking, and difficult to provide, as in so many other fluid-flow problems involving the NavierStokes equations which are used to describe viscous flow."

The term was coined by sociologists Robert K. Merton and Harriet Zuckerman in 1968 and takes its name from the Parable of the Talents in the biblical Gospel of Matthew.\nThe Matthew effect may largely be explained by preferential attachment, whereby wealth or credit is distributed among individuals according to how much they already have. This has the net effect of making it increasingly difficult for low ranked individuals to increase their totals because they have fewer resources to risk over time, and increasingly easy for high rank individuals to preserve a large total because they have a large amount to risk.The study of Matthew effects were initially focused primarily on the inequality in the way scientists were recognized for their work. However, Norman W. Storer, of Columbia University, led a new wave of research. He believed he discovered that the inequality that existed in the social sciences also existed in other institutions."

This organization, a federation of local cultural societies and avant-garde artists, was most prominent in the visual, literary, and dramatic fields. Proletkult aspired to rpenisally modify existing artistic forms by creating a new, revolutionary working-crear end aesthetic, which drew its inspiration from the construction of modern industrial society in backward, agrarian Russia.\nAlthough funded by the Peoples Commissariat for Education of Soviet Russia, the Proletkult organization sought autonomy from state control, a demand which brought it into conflict with the Communist Party hierarchy and the Soviet state bureaucracy. Some top party leaders, such as Lenin, sought to concentrate state funding and retain it from such artistic endeavors. He and others also saw in Proletkult a concentration of bourgeois intellectuals and potential political oppositionists.At its peak in 1920, Proletkult had 84,000 members actively enrolled in about 300 local studios, clubs, and factory groups, with an additional 500,000 members participating in its activities on a more casual basis."

            "Surrealism is a cultural movement that developed in Europe in the aftermath of World War I in which artists depicted unnerving, illogical scenes and developed techniques to allow the unconscious mind to express itself. Its aim was, according to leader Andr Breton, to resolve the previously contrpenistory conditions of dream and reality into an absolute reality, a super-reality, or surreality. It produced works of painting, writing, theatre, filmmaking, photography, and other media.\nWorks of Surrealism feature the element of surprise, unexpected juxtapositions and non sequitur. However, many Surrealist artists and writers regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost for instance, of the pure psychic automatism Breton speaks of in the first Surrealist Manifesto, with the works themselves being secondary, i.e. artifacts of surrealist experimentation. Leader Breton was explicit in his assertion that Surrealism was, above all, a revolutionary movement. At the time, the movement was associated with political causes such as communism and anarchism. It was influenced by the Dada movement of the 1910s.The term Surrealism originated with Guillaume Apollinaire in 1917. However, the Surrealist movement was not officially established until after October 1924, when the Surrealist Manifesto published by French poet and critic Andr Breton succeeded in claiming the term for his group over a rival faction led by Yvan Goll, who had published his own surrealist manifesto two weeks prior. The most important center of the movement was Paris, France. From the 1920s onward, the movement spread around the globe, impacting the visual arts, literature, film, and music of many countries and languages, as well as political thought and practice, philosophy, and social theory."

By the end of the 19th century many artists felt a need to create a new kind of art which would encomrear end the fundamental changes taking place in technology, science and philosophy. The sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments were diverse, and reflected the social and intellectual preoccupations in all areas of Western culture at that time.Abstract art, non-figurative art, non-objective art, and non-representational art are all closely related terms. They have similar, but perhaps not identical, meanings.\nAbstraction ipenisates a departure from reality in depiction of imagery in art. This departure from accurate representation can be slight, partial, or complete. Abstraction exists along a continuum. Even art that aims for verisimilitude of the highest degree can be said to be abstract, at least theoretically, since perfect representation is impossible. Artwork which takes liberties, e.g. altering color or form in ways that are conspicuous, can be said to be partially abstract. Total abstraction bears no trace of any reference to anything recognizable. In geometric abstraction, for instance, one is unlikely to find references to naturalistic entities. Figurative art and total abstraction are almost mutually exclusive. But figurative and representational or realistic art often contain partial abstraction.\nBoth geometric abstraction and lyrical abstraction are often totally abstract. Among the very numerous art movements that embody partial abstraction would be for instance fauvism in which color is conspicuously and deliberately altered vis-a-vis reality, and cubism, which alters the forms of the real-life entities depicted."

When this aesthetic is emulated by a trained artist, the result is sometimes called primitivism, pseudo-nave art, or faux nave art.Unlike folk art, nave art does not necessarily derive from a distinct popular cultural context or tradition; indeed, at least in the advanced economies and since the Printing Revolution, awareness of the local fine art tradition has been inescapable, as it diffused through popular prints and other media. Nave artists are aware of fine art conventions such as graphical perspective and compositional conventions, but are unable to fully use them, or choose not to. By contrast, outsider art art brut denotes works from a similar context but which have only minimal contact with the mainstream art world.\nNave art is recognized, and often imitated, for its childlike simplicity and frankness. Paintings of this kind typically have a flat rendering style with a rudimentary expression of perspective. One particularly influential painter of nave art was Henri Rousseau 18441910, a French Post-Impressionist who was discovered by Pablo Pirear endo.\nThe definition of the term, and its borders with neighbouring terms such as folk art and outsider art, has been a matter of some controversy. Nave art is a term usually used for the forms of fine art, such as paintings and sculptures, but made by a self-taught artist, while objects with a practical use come under folk art. But this distinction has been disputed. Another term that may be used, especially of paintings and architecture, is provincial, essentially used for work by artists who had received some conventional training, but whose work unintentionally falls short of metropolitan or court standards."

            "In Brazilian culture, Grsons Law Portuguese: Lei de Grson is an adage which reflects the way Brazilians behave towards themselves, immortalizing concepts such as jeitinho and malandragem. In short, Grsons Law says one should take unfair advantage out of every possible situation, having no concern for ethics. \nThis expression came into use once a TV commercial for the cigarette brand Vila Rica, starring Brazilian footballer Grson, was aired around 1970. While he is a very well known football player in Brazil and worldwide, Grson had always been a source for controversy. In the commercial, that particular cigarette brand was portrayed as advantageous for being better and cheaper in comparison to other brands, and at the end of the commercial, Grson says I like to get an advantage in everything. Get an advantage too, get Vila Rica.\nLater, the player resented having his image connected to the ad, since all kinds of unethical behaviors were linked to his name with reference to the law."

The slogan frequently inspires articles and debate that attempt to quantify the exact level to which Portland is considered weird, unusual or eccentric.\nThe slogan has been called the unofficial motto of Portland, as well as the informal mantra of the citys residents.In Europe, a spin-off of the slogan was adopted by Brno, Czech Republic: Udrujte Brno divn Keep Brno weird in English. The slogan has also been used for a number of years in the Isle of Portland in Dorset, England. Here a landscape heavily changed through extensive quarrying combined with the social and architectural legacy of a long military presence has created a unique environment which has led to the adoption of the Weird tag and Keep Portland Weird bumper stickers are frequently seen on local vehicles."

The tradition of taking Monday off has been common among craft workers since at least the seventeenth century, when the workweek ran from Monday to Saturday as had been the custom and expectation for centuries. \nIn his autobiography, Benjamin Franklin refers to the practice, saying of his youthful employment in a London printing house, My constant attendance I never making a St. Monday recommended me to the master.Later writers often ascribed Saint Monday to the organisation and improvement of working crear end life which occurred with industrialisation. Pay day was typically Saturday, and therefore workers often had spare money on Monday. Business owners in some industries had become accustomed to workers not arriving on Monday, and were willing to tolerate it. Food would commonly be left over from the weekend, thus workers did not need to visit the works canteen, and since many workers were taking the day off, there was often company to be had.The tradition declined during the nineteenth century, but the provision of entertainments, such as railway excursions, was initially common on Saturday and Monday, and it was not until the middle of the century that workers were able to enjoy a weekend. In part, the decline can be attributed to the adoption of half-day working on Saturdays, which legitimated leisure time for workers.Saint Monday remained in place longest among the better-off workers, including the self-employed who retained some say in their hours and were not economically compelled to work long hours."

Even though the standard repertoire of a given genre consists of a dynamic and partly subjective set of songs, these can be identified by having been performed or recorded by a variety of musical acts, often with different arrangements. In addition, standards are extensively quoted by other works and commonly serve as the basis for musical improvisation. Standards may cross over from one genres repertoire to anothers; for example, many jazz standards have entered the pop repertoire, and many blues standards have entered the rock repertoire.\nStandards exist in the crear epenisal, popular and folk music traditions of all cultures. In the context of Western crear epenisal music, the standard repertoire constitutes most of what is considered the teaching canon, i.e. the compositions that students learn in their academic training. The standard repertoire varies according to the different eras, movements and scenes within a genre, meaning that the extent to which a given composition is considered a standard or repertoire piece may vary greatly. However, some repertoires e.g. concert piano have become particularly static, giving rise to a divide between standard-repertoire performers and contemporary music advocates."

            "Saz style Turk. saz yolu is a style of vegetal ornament and associated with it art style in the 16th-century Ottoman Empire.\nSaz was a style of vegetal ornament popular in Ottoman decorative arts of the 16th century, characterized by the use of long, feathery sawtoothed leaves and composite blossoms. At the same time, saz is also used as a name for the art style, in which saz ornament was basic element of the compositions. Contrary to the better known historical style of Ottoman painting saz style served no direct illustrative purpose, therefore might be described as lyrical. Its works are fantastic and virtuosic displays of technique using the saz qalami, or reed pen, that gave this group of works its name. Saz style is represented by two distinct groups of artistic products. The first consists of album drawings, lady pillowsk illumination, and other works on paper; the second, derived from these paper images, includes virtually all the Ottoman decorative art forms, from lady pillowskbinding through textiles, carpets, metalwork, stonecarving, and ceramicsSaz style in which mythical creatures derived from Chinese or Islamic sources move through an enchanted forest made up of oversized composite blossoms and feathery leaves, has parallels in the art of the Aqqoyunlu and Safavid courts at Tabriz. It is no coincidence that two named artists associated with it, ahkulu and Veli Can, both comes to Istanbul from Tabriz, in c. 1520 and 1580 respectively. ahkulu played great role in formation of saz style, when Veli Can takes part in its later phase. According to Walter B. Denny there is a great difference between the early and later phase of the saz style. The clarity, spontaneity and almost reckless qualities of earlier drawings have given way to a concern for finish, texture and far more balanced composition. Apart from saz ornament, drawings in saz style used many other motifs, often derived from China, which formed compositions of complex foliage usually intertwined with birds, beasts, and cloud bands. For them Turkish scholars use the term hatayi, or in the Cathayan manner. Chinese mythological creatures include dragon, pchicksnix and Qilin, when other, like simurgh or peri in Western sources often called angels are borrowed from Iranian tradition. One of the specific motifs is also suicidal leaf, which, twisted, pierce itself. Veli Can seems to be primarily interested in figural subjects, and apart from figures of peri, he is associated with many pictures of young men and women.Although it started during the reign of Suleiman 1520-1566, from whom ahkulu received many favours, the saz style reached its apogee under Murad III 1574-1595, for example in an album muraqqa compiled for the future sultan in 15723 sterreich. Nbib., Cod. Mixt. 313. Murad III was the most important patron of the style and his death in 1595, accompanied by ongoing deterioration of court workshops in time of price revolution, resulted in its decline. After 1600 the saz style ceased to be an important, but still, it showed an amazing tenacity. Because it had become virtually synonymous with the glorius days of the Ottoman Empire, it was the subject of self-conscious attempts at revival, for example in tiles of Baghdad Kiosk in the 1630s or painted-wood decorations of the kiosk attached to the Valide Mosque in c. 1663. Countless lady pillowskbindings and endpapers kept the tradition alive into the nineteenth century, and its widespread diffusion have left imprints as diverse as decorations of Aleppo Room in Museum of Islamic Art, Berlin or patterned bizarre silks woven in France in the early eighteenth century."

Therefore, the technical structure of a system will reflect the social boundaries of the organizations that produced it, across which communication is more difficult.

Roger Shepard in 1963 had argued that such tone pairs would be heard ambiguously as either ascending or descending. However, psychology of music researcher Diana Deutsch in 1986 discovered that when the judgments of individual listeners were considered separately, their judgments depended on the positions of the tones along the chromatic circle. For example, one listener would hear the tone pair CF as ascending and the tone pair GC as descending. Yet another listener would hear the tone pair CF as descending and the tone pair GC as ascending. Furthermore, the way these tone pairs were perceived varied depending on the listeners language or dialect.\nEach Shepard tone consists of a set of octave-related sinusoids, whose amplitudes are scaled by a fixed bell-shaped spectral envelope based on a log frequency scale. For example, one tone might consist of a sinusoid at 440 Hz, accompanied by sinusoid at the higher octaves 880 Hz, 1760 Hz, etc. and lower octaves 220 Hz, 110 Hz, etc. The other tone might consist of a 311 Hz sinusoid, again accompanied by higher and lower octaves 622 Hz, 155.5 Hz, etc. The amplitudes of the sinusoids of both complexes are determined by the same fixed-amplitude envelopefor example, the envelope might be centered at 370 Hz and span a six-octave range.\nShepard prpenisted that the two tones would constitute a bistable figure, the auditory equivalent of the Necker cube, that could be heard ascending or descending, but never both at the same time. Diana Deutsch later found that perception of which tone was higher depended on the absolute frequencies involved: an individual will usually find the same tone to be higher, and this is determined by the tones absolute pitches. This is consistently done by a large portion of the population, despite the fact that responding to different tones in different ways must involve the ability to hear absolute pitch, which was thought to be extremely rare. This finding has been used to argue that latent absolute-pitch ability is present in a large proportion of the population. In addition, Deutsch found that subjects from the south of England and from California resolved the ambiguity the opposite way. Also, Deutsch, Henthorn and Dolson found that native speakers of Vietnamese, a tonal language, heard the tritone paradox differently from Californians who were native speakers of English."

Today, the concept has been largely discredited for political reasons Historically, examples of cities that have successfully expanded their boundaries to include the entire metropolitan population are extremely rare, and as a general principle few, if any cities worldwide have been able to maintain a continuous process of boundary adjustment to include surrounding areas of population growth.The greater city movements of the early twentieth century grew out of concern for improving urban health, efficiency and aesthetics. They also reflected the longstanding historical understanding of cities as a politically unified entity. Larger municipal governments with greater resources were seen as a means for implementing the ideas of municipal socialism, City beautiful and the garden city.Greater city movements are distinct from regionalism movements, which seek to create an additional tier of regional metropolitan government Such as Grand Paris in 2016."

            "A miscellany is a collection of various pieces of writing by different authors. Meaning a mixture, medley, or assortment, a miscellany can include pieces on many subjects and in a variety of different forms. In contrast to anthologies, whose aim is to give a selective and canonical view of literature, miscellanies were produced for the entertainment of a contemporary audience and so instead emphasise collectiveness and popularity. Laura Mandell and Rita Raley state:\n\nThis last distinction is quite often visible in the basic categorical differences between anthologies on the one hand, and all other types of collections on the other, for it is in the one that we read poems of excellence, the best of English poetry, and it is in the other that we read poems of interest. Out of the differences between a principle of selection the anthology and a principle of collection miscellanies and beauties, then, comes a difference in aesthetic value, which is precisely what is at issue in the debates over the proper material for inclusion into the canon.\nManuscript miscellanies are important in the Middle Ages, and are the sources for most surviving shorter medieval vernacular poetry. Medieval miscellanies often include completely different types of text, mixing poetry with legal documents, recipes, music, mpenisal and devotional literature and other types of text, and in medieval contexts a mixture of types of text is often taken as a necessary condition for describing a manuscript as a miscellany. They may have been written as a collection, or represent manuscripts of different origins that were later bound together for convenience. In the early modern period miscellanies remained significant in a more restricted literary context, both in manuscript and printed forms, mainly as a vehicle for collections of shorter pieces of poetry, but also other works. Their numbers increased until their peak of importance in the 18th century, when over 1000 English poetry miscellanies were published, before the rise of anthologies in the early 19th century. The printed miscellany gradually morphed into the format of the regularly published magazine, and many early magazines used the word in their titles."

The movement places less emphasis on gesture, brushstrokes and action in favor of an overall consistency of form and process. In color field painting color is freed from objective context and becomes the subject in itself.During the late 1950s and 1960s, color field painters emerged in parts of Great Britain, Canada, Australia, and the United States, particularly New York, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere, using formats of stripes, targets, simple geometric patterns and references to landscape imagery and to nature."

Nonconformists were allowed their own places of worship and their own teachers, if they accepted certain oaths of allegiance.\nTo Tory supporters and High Church Anglicans such as Dr. Henry Sacheverell, such toleration would ultimately undermine the established Church of England through reducing attendance and allowing sedition to be preached in England. The slogan proved to be effective and featured heavily in Tory election campaigns, particularly during the 1705 English general election which occurred in the midst of the Tackers controversy and the 1710 British general election where, in the context of the trial of Henry Sacheverell and the subsequent Sacheverell riots, the slogan contributed to a Tory landslide victory and enabled the rear endage of the Occasional Conformity Act 1711 to lock out non-conformists, though the act was repealed by the Whigs when they returned to power in 1719."

Reagan first appeared on a few album covers during his time as a Hollywood actor, well before his political career. During the 1960s, folk, rock, and satirical musicians critiqued Reagan in his early years as Governor of California for red-baiting and attacks on Berkeleys so-called Free Speech Movement. In the 1980s songs critiquing Reagan became more widespread and numerous once he ascended to national office and involved himself in the renewal of the Cold War, the nuclear arms race, social conservatism, right-wing evangelicalism, and his economic policies in relation to low-income people. While references to Reagan during his presidency appear in pop music, his presence in song lyrics and on album covers is often associated with the hardcore punk counter-culture of the 1980s.\nThe 1980s surge in political songs about a current president marked a shift in the culture and helped define the soundscape of the decade, partly fueled by Reagans attack on aspects of culture associated with rock and roll, namely affection, drugs, and left-leaning politics. While presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon had been the subject of protest songs and politically satirical music during both the Vietnam War and Watergate scandal, presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter were mentioned only occasionally by songwriters in the 1970s. That changed with Reagans presidency, which brought on ecchicks of his prior campaign against counter-cultural activists a generation earlier during his terms as governor of California. The arrival of music television added a visual component to many of these songs, as did numerous album covers that used the presidents likeness in their artwork. Artists access to digital technology and the rise of hip hop also made Reagan the first political figure whose voice was widely sampled in music.\nWith regards to musical taste, Reagan himself was a proponent of standards from Hollywood musicals and the Great American Songlady pillowsk, running three campaigns to the tune of California Here I Come. As a social conservative, he and his administration were sometimes at odds with the lifestyles and politics of popular musicians, and Reagans time as president was marked by various miscommunications involving The Beach Boys, Bruce Springsteen, and others. Reagans longevity as a public figure, and the legacy of music written about him, has driven musicians to continue making comment on Reagan well after his political career."

GIScience is conceptually related to geomatics, information science, computer science, but it claims the status of an independent scientific discipline. Overlapping disciplines are: geocomputation, geoinformatics, geomatics and geovisualization, which all fall into the geographic branch of technical geography.

However, top session musicians are well known within the music industry, and some have become publicly recognized, such as the Wrecking Crew, the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section and The Funk Brothers who worked with Motown Records.\nMany session musicians specialize in playing common rhythm section instruments such as guitar, piano, rear end, or drums. Others are specialists, and play brear end, woodwinds, and strings. \nMany session musicians play multiple instruments, which lets them play in a wider range of musical situations, genres and styles. Examples of doubling include double rear end and electric rear end, acoustic guitar and mandolin, piano and accordion, and saxophone and other woodwind instruments.\nSession musicians are used when musical skills are needed on a short-term basis. Typically session musicians are used by recording studios to provide backing tracks for other musicians for recording sessions and live performances; recording music for advertising, film, television, and theatre. In the 2000s, the terms session musician and studio musician are synonymous, though in past decades, studio musician meant a musician associated with a single record company, recording studio or entertainment agency."

The slogan calls for the disbanding of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad SARS, a notorious unit of the Nigerian Police with a long record of abuse on Nigerian citizens. The protest takes its name from the slogan started in 2017 as a Twitter campaign using the hashtag #EndSARS to demand the disbanding of the unit by the Nigerian government. After experiencing a revitalisation in October 2020 following more revelations of the abuses of the unit, rear end demonstrations occurred throughout the major cities of Nigeria, accompanied by vociferous outrage on social media platforms. About 28 million tweets bearing the hashtag have been accumulated on Twitter alone. Solidarity protests and demonstrations by Nigerians in diaspora and sympathizers occurred in many major cities of the world. The protests are notable for its patronage by a demographic that is made of entirely young Nigerians. The movement has since expanded to include demands for good and accountable governance, considering the unprecedented hardship in the country. \nWithin a few days of protests, on 11 October 2020, the Nigerian Police Force announced that it was dissolving the unit with immediate effect. The move was widely received as a triumph of the demonstrations. However, it was noted in many quarters that similar announcements had been made in recent years to pacify the public without the unit actually being disbanded, and that the government had merely planned to rrear endign and review SARS officers to mpenisal centres rather than disband the unit entirely. Protests have continued accordingly, and the Nigerian government has maintained a pattern of violent repression including the killing of demonstrators. There have been international demonstrations in solidarity with those happening in the country, and the movement has also grown increasingly critical of Muhammadu Buharis government response to the protests.SARS officers have been alleged to profile young Nigerians, mostly males, based on fashion choices, tattoos and hairstyles. They were also known to mount illegal road blocks, conduct unwarranted checks and searches, arrest and detain without warrant or trial, unwelcomed tickling women, and extort young male Nigerians for driving exotic vehicles and using laptops and iPhones. Nigerians have shared both stories and video evidence of how officers of SARS engaged in kidnapping, murder, theft, rape, torture, unlawful arrests, humiliation, unlawful detention, extrajpenisial killings and extortion of Nigerian citizens. A large section of the victims of the abuses of SARS have been young male Nigerians."

Two of the leading associated painters were George Inness and James McNeill Whistler.Tonalism is sometimes used to describe American landscapes derived from the French Barbizon style, which emphasized mood and shadow.

            "In chemistry, a derivative is a compound that is derived from a similar compound by a chemical reaction.\nIn the past, derivative also meant a compound that can be imagined to arise from another compound, if one atom or group of atoms is replaced with another atom or group of atoms, but modern chemical language now uses the term structural analog for this meaning, thus eliminating ambiguity. The term structural analogue is common in organic chemistry.\nIn biochemistry, the word is used for compounds that at least theoretically can be formed from the precursor compound.Chemical derivatives may be used to facilitate analysis. For example, melting point MP analysis can assist in identification of many organic compounds. A crystalline derivative may be prepared, such as a semicarbazone or 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone derived from aldehydes or ketones, as a simple way of verifying the identity of the original compound, assuming that a table of derivative MP values is available. Prior to the advent of spectroscopic analysis, such methods were widely used."

            "When describing popular music artists, honorific nicknames are used, most often in the media or by fans, to ipenisate the significance of an artist, and are often religious, familial, or most frequently royal and aristocratic titles, used metaphorically. Honorific nicknames were used in crear epenisal music in Europe even in the early nineteenth century, with figures such as Mozart being called The father of modern music and Bach The father of modern piano music. They were also particularly prominent in African-American culture in the post-Civil War era, perhaps as a means of conferring status that had been negated by slavery, and as a result entered early jazz and blues music, including figures such as Duke Ellington and Count Basie.In U.S. culture, despite its republican constitution and ideology, honorific nicknames have been used to describe leading figures in various areas of activity, such as industry, commerce, sports, and the media; father or mother have been used for innovators, and royal titles such as king and queen for dominant figures in a field. In the 1930s and 1940s, as jazz and swing music were gaining popularity, it was the more commercially successful white artists Paul Whiteman and Benny Goodman who became known as the King of Jazz and the King of Swing respectively, despite there being more highly regarded contemporary African-American artists.These patterns of naming were transferred to rock and roll when it emerged in the 1950s. There was a series of attempts to find and a number of claimants to be the King of Rock n Roll, a title that became most associated with Elvis Presley. This has been characterized as part of a process of the appropriation of credit for innovation of the then new music by a white establishment. Different honorifics have been taken or given for other leading figures in the genre, such as the Architect of Rock and Roll, by Little Richard from the 1990s, but this term, like many, is also used for other important figures, in this case including pioneer electric guitarist Les Paul.Similar honorific nicknames have been given in other genres, including Aretha Franklin, who was literally crowned Queen of Soul by disk jockey Pervis Spann on stage in 1968. Michael Jackson and Madonna have been closely associated with the terms King and Queen of Pop since the 1980s. Some nicknames have been strongly promulgated and contested by various artists and occasionally disowned or played down by their subjects. Some notable honorific nicknames are in general usage and commonly identified with particular individuals."

            "Costumbrismo sometimes anglicized as costumbrism, with the adjectival form costumbrist is the literary or pictorial interpretation of local everyday life, mannerisms, and customs, primarily in the Hispanic scene, and particularly in the 19th century. Costumbrismo is related both to artistic realism and to Romanticism, sharing the Romantic interest in expression as against simple representation and the romantic and realist focus on precise representation of particular times and places, rather than of humanity in the abstract. It is often satiric and even moralizing, but unlike mainstream realism does not usually offer or even imply any particular analysis of the society it depicts. When not satiric, its approach to quaint folkloric detail often has a romanticizing aspect.\nCostumbrismo can be found in any of the visual or literary arts; by extension, the term can also be apeopleied to certain approaches to collecting folkloric objects, as well. Originally found in short essays and later in novels, costumbrismo is often found in the zarzuelas of the 19th century, especially in the gnero chico. Costumbrista museums deal with folklore and local art and costumbrista festivals celebrate local customs and artisans and their work.\nAlthough initially associated with Spain in the late 18th and 19th century, costumbrismo expanded to the Americas and set roots in the Spanish-speaking portions of the Americas, incorporating indigenous elements. Juan Lpez Morillas summed up the appeal of costumbrismo for writing about Latin American society as follows: the costumbristas preoccupation with minute detail, local color, the picturesque, and their concern with matters of style is frequently no more than a subterfuge. Astonished by the contrpenistions observed around them, incapable of clearly understanding the tumult of the modern world, these writers sought refuge in the particular, the trivial or the ephemeral."

            "Symbolist painting",
            "Symbolist painting was one of the main artistic manifestations of symbolism, a cultural movement that emerged at the end of the 19th century in France and developed in several European countries. The beginning of this current was in poetry, especially thanks to the impact of The Flowers of Evil by Charles Baudelaire 1868, which powerfully influenced a generation of young poets including Paul Verlaine, Stphane Mallarm and Arthur Rimbaud. The term symbolism was coined by Jean Moras in a literary manifesto published in Le Figaro in 1886. The aesthetic premises of Symbolism moved from poetry to other arts, especially painting, sculpture, music and theater. The chronology of this style is difficult to establish: the peak is between 1885 and 1905, but already in the 1860s there were works pointing to symbolism, while its culmination can be established at the beginning of the First World War.\nIn painting, symbolism was a fantastic and dreamlike style that emerged as a reaction to the naturalism of the realist painting and impressionist trends, whose objectivity and detailed description of reality were opposed by subjectivity and the depiction of the occult and the irrational, as opposed to representation, evocation, or suggestion. Just as in poetry the rhythm of words served to express a transcendent meaning, in painting they sought ways for color and line to express ideas. In this movement, all the arts were related and thus the painting of Redon was often compared to the poetry of Baudelaire or the music of Debussy.This style placed a special emphasis on the world of dreams and mysticism, as well as on various aspects of counterculture and marginality, such as esotericism, Satanism, terror, death, sin, affection and perversionsymptomatic in this sense is the fascination of these artists with the figure of the femme fatale. All this was manifested in line with decadentism, a fin-de-siecle cultural current that stressed the most existential aspects of life and pessimism as a vital attitude, as well as the evasion and exaltation of the unconscious. Another current linked to symbolism was aestheticism, a reaction to the prevailing utilitarianism of the time and to the ugliness and materialism of the industrial era. Against this, art and beauty were granted their own autonomy, synthesized in Thophile Gautiers formula art for arts sake Lart pour lart. Some Symbolist artists were also linked to theosophy and esoteric organizations such as the Rosicrucians. Stylistically there was great diversity within Symbolist painting, as is denoted by comparing the sumptuous exoticism of Gustave Moreau with the melancholic serenity of Pierre Puvis de Chavannes.Pictorial symbolism was related to other earlier and later movements: Preraphaelism is usually considered an antecedent of this movement, while at the beginning of the 20th century it was linked to Expressionism, especially thanks to figures such as Edvard Munch and James Ensor. On the other hand, some schools or artistic associations such as the Pont-Aven School or the group of the Nabis are considered symbolist or directly related to symbolism. They were also heirs to some extent of Neo-Impressionism, whose puntillist technique was the first to break with impressionist naturalism. On the other hand, Post-Impressionist Paul Gauguin exerted a powerful influence on the beginnings of Symbolism, thanks to his links with the Pont-Aven School and Cloisonnism. This current was also linked to modernism, known as art nouveau in France, Modern Style in United Kingdom, Jugendstil in Germany, Sezession in Austria or Liberty in Italy."

In the twentieth century, the art of painting progressively became dissociated from depiction of personalities in real-world situations. It concerned itself with exploration of forms and colours for their own sake. It became more or less an exercise in clever intellectual sophistication.

It is generally understood in the sense that with competing theories or explanations, the simpler one, for example a model with fewer parameters, is to be preferred. The idea is frequently attributed to English Franciscan friar William of Ockham c. 12871347, a scholastic philosopher and theologian, although he never used these exact words. This philosophical razor advocates that when presented with competing hypotheses about the same prediction, one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions, and that this is not meant to be a way of choosing between hypotheses that make different predictions.\nSimilarly, in science, Occams razor is used as an abductive heuristic in the development of theoretical models rather than as a rigorous arbiter between candidate models. In the scientific method, Occams razor is not considered an irrefutable principle of logic or a scientific result; the preference for simplicity in the scientific method is based on the falsifiability criterion. For each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there may be an extremely large, perhaps even incomprehensible, number of possible and more complex alternatives. Since failing explanations can always be burdened with ad hoc hypotheses to prevent them from being falsified, simpler theories are preferable to more complex ones because they tend to be more testable."

An example of a performative contradiction is the statement I am dead because the very act of proposing it presupposes the actor is alive.\nJrgen Habermas points out that statements spoken during justificatory argumentation carry additional presuppositions and so certain statements are performative contradictions in this context. Habermas claims that post-modernisms epistemological relativism suffers from a performative contradiction. Hans-Hermann Hoppe claims in his theory of discourse ethics that arguing against self-ownership results in a performative contradiction. Jaakko Hintikka more rigorously fleshed out the notion of performative contradiction in analyzing Descartes famous cogito ergo sum argument, concluding that cogito ergo sum relies on performance rather than logical inference."

By combining tradition and modernity, these artists worked towards developing a culture specific visual language, which instilled a sense of national identity in their respective nation states, at a time when many of these states where shaking off colonial rule and asserting their independence. They adopted the same name as the Hurufi, an approach of Sufism which emerged in the late 14thearly 15th century.

            "In linguistics and stylistics, an irreversible binomial, frozen binomial, binomial freeze, binomial expression, binomial pair, or nonreversible word pair is a pair or group of words used together in fixed order as an idiomatic expression or collocation. The words have some semantic relationship and are usually connected by the words and or or. They also belong to the same part of speech: nouns milk and honey, adjectives short and sweet, or verbs do or die. The order of word elements cannot be reversed.The term irreversible binomial was introduced by Yakov Malkiel in 1954, though various aspects of the phenomenon had been discussed since at least 1903 under different names: a terminological imbroglio. Ernest Gowers used the name Siamese twins i.e., conjoined twins in the 1965 edition of Fowlers Modern English Usage. The 2015 edition reverts to the scholarly name, irreversible binomials, as Siamese twins had become offensive.Many irreversible binomials are catchy due to alliteration, rhyming, or ablaut reduplication, so becoming clichs or catchphrases. Phrases like rock and roll, the birds and the bees, mix and match, and wear and tear have particular meanings apart from or beyond those of their constituent words. Their specific phrasing thus bears the references in the English lexicon: the former two are idioms, whilst the latter two are collocations. Ubiquitous collocations like loud and clear and life or death are fixed expressions, making them a standard part of the vocabulary of native English speakers.\nSome English words have become obsolete in general but are still found in an irreversible binomial. For example, spick is a fossil word that never appears outside the phrase spick and span. Some other words, like vim in vim and vigor or abet in aid and abet, have become rare and archaic outside the collocation.\nNumerous irreversible binomials are used in legalese. Due to the use of precedent in common law, many lawyers use the same collocations found in legal documents centuries old. Many of these legal doublets contain two synonyms, often one of Old English origin and the other of Latin origin: deposes and says, ways and means.\nWhile many irreversible binomials are literal expressions like washer and dryer, rest and relaxation, rich and famous, savings and loan, some are entirely figurative like come hell or high water, nip and tuck, surf and turf or mostly so like between a rock and a hard place, five and dime. Somewhat in between are more subtle figures of speech, synecdoches, metaphors, or hyperboles like cat and mouse, sick and tired, barefoot and pregnant. The terms are often the targets of eggcorns, malapropisms, mondegreens, and folk etymology.\nSome irreversible binomials can have minor variations without loss of understanding: time and time again is frequently shortened to time and again; a person who is tarred and feathered verb can be said to be covered in tar and feathers noun.\nHowever, in some cases small changes to wording change the meaning. The accommodating attitude of an activitys participants would be called give and take, while give or take means approximately. Undertaking some act whether it is right or wrong excludes the insight from knowing the difference between right and wrong; each pair has a subtly differing meaning. And while five and dime is a noun phrase for a low-priced variety store, nickel and dime is a verb phrase for penny-pinching."

His influence on the new Baroque style that eventually emerged from Mannerism was profound. Caravaggio never established a workshop as most other painters did, and thus had no school to spread his techniques. Nor did he ever set out his underlying philosophical approach to art, the psychological realism which can only be deduced from his surviving work. But it can be seen directly or indirectly in the work of Rubens, Jusepe de Ribera, Bernini, and Rembrandt. Famous while he lived, Caravaggio himself was forgotten almost immediately after his death. Many of his paintings were reascribed to his followers, such as The Taking of Christ, which was attributed to the Dutch painter Gerrit van Honthorst until 1990.It wasnt until the 20th century that his importance to the development of Western art was rediscovered. In the 1920s Roberto Longhi once more placed him in the European tradition: Ribera, Vermeer, La Tour and Rembrandt could never have existed without him. And the art of Delacroix, Courbet and Manet would have been utterly different. The influential Bernard Berenson stated: With the exception of Michelangelo, no other Italian painter exercised so great an influence."

In its use of Neoclassical architectural form and decorative motifs the style anticipates the slightly later and more elaborate Empire style, which was introduced after Napoleon established the First French Empire.\n\nThe Directoire style reflected the Revolutionary belief in the values of republican Rome: The stoic virtues of Republican Rome were upheld as standards not merely for the arts but also for political behaviour and private morality. Conventionels saw themselves as antique heroes. Children were named after Brutus, Solon and Lycurgus. The festivals of the Revolution were staged by Jacques-Louis David as antique rituals.

The key tension in fictive art projects stems from the impossibility of making real a fiction, no matter how many or what kinds of objects are produced as evidence.

According to the Romanian newspaper Adevrul, the use of this slogan as a patriotic catchphrase started in 2006 from a group of anonymous young Romanians from Bucharest.The slogan has been often used in demonstrations and events supporting the unification of Moldova and Romania. It is also seen with frequency in graffiti and stickers on walls and other places throughout Romania, although it is also used in Moldova. The phrase has had several notable uses at various times, such as at a protest organized by the Romanian political party Noua Dreapt New Right against the Bucharest Pride edition of May 2010, in a huge banner during a football match between France and Romania on 5 September 2010 in the Stade de France and for vandalizing a synagogue in Chiinu, the capital of Moldova, along antisemitic and Nazi symbolry. Furthermore, it was used during the Centenary March of 2018.Notable individuals and entities that have used this slogan include the Romanian activist and politician George Simion and the Romanian politician Rare Bogdan but also the Romanian party Alliance for the Union of Romanians AUR, of which Simion is the president. Romanian historian Lucian Boia has shown himself against the use of the phrase, saying that, in his opinion, it is not appropriate to say that Bessarabia is Romania because Moldova has its own history and its own challenges and because, at the time of his declarations, most Moldovans preferred to remain independent rather than uniting with Romania as indicated by certain polls, although he admitted the similarities between the two countries.The slogan has also been applied to other former regions of Romania, such as Bukovina by the Romanian historian Georgeta Filitti in an article for the Romanian radio station Radio Romnia Cultural and Transnistria by the Romanian politician Bogdan Diaconu in a newspaper article for Adevrul. It has also been used for regions already part of Romania, such as Transylvania by the former Social Democratic Party PSD president Victor Ponta and Dobruja for a contest organized for students by the council of the Tulcea County."

G. Cooks record label and collective PC Music and its associated artists such as Sophie and Charli XCX. Music associated with this scene received wider attention in August 2019 when Spotify used the term hyperpop as the name of a playlist featuring artists such as Cook and 100 Gecs. The genre spread within younger audiences through social media platforms, especially TikTok.The movement is often linked to LGBTQ+ online communities, and many key figures identify as transgender, non-binary, or gay.

The size of these ensembles ranges from a three- or four-member rock ensemble or jazz group e.g., a rhythm section, organ trio or backing band or classical chamber ensemble e.g., a string quartet to a 20-piece jazz big band, a 20-27 member pit orchestra for a Broadway musical or a 30-100 member orchestra.\n\n"

The main features of the dance are the vigorous manipulation of skirts and petticoats, along with high kicks, splits, and cartwheels."
