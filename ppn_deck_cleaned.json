            "Climate change and cities are deeply connected. Cities are one of the greatest contributors and likely best opportunities for addressing climate change. Cities are also one of the most vulnerable parts of the human society to the effects of climate change, and likely one of the most important solutions for reducing the environmental impact of humans. More than half of the worlds population is in cities, consuming a large portion of food and goods produced outside of cities. The increase of urban population growth is one of the main factors in air-quality problems. In the year 2016, 31 mega-cities reported having at least 10 million in their population, 8 of which surrear endd 20 million people. The UN projects that 68% of the world population will live in urban areas by 2050. Hence, cities have a significant influence on construction and transportationtwo of the key contributors to global warming emissions. Moreover, because of processes that create climate conflict and climate refugees, city areas are expected to grow during the next several decades, stressing infrastructure and concentrating more impoverished peoples in cities.Because of the high density and effects like the urban heat island affect, weather changes due to climate change are likely to greatly effect cities, exacerbating existing problems, such as air pollution, water scarcity, and heat illness in the metropolitan areas. Studies have shown that if body temperature exceeds 39C for a period of time, serious heat stroke may occur. Some of the other extreme weather conditions caused by climate change include extreme floods, deathly snowstorms, ice storms, heat waves, droughts, and hurricanes, which are often deathly and harmful. Studies have shown that heat waves are three times more likely to occur and have become more intense since the 1960s. Moreover, because most cities have been built on rivers or coastal areas, cities are frequently vulnerable to the subsequent effects of sea level rise, which cause coastal flooding and erosion, and those effects are deeply connected with other urban environmental problems, like subsidence and aquifer depletion.\nA report by the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group described consumption based emissions as having significantly more impact than production-based emissions within cities. The report estimates that 85% of the emissions associated with goods within a city is generated outside of that city. Climate change adaptation and mitigation investments in cities will be important in reducing the impacts of some of the largest contributors of greenhouse gas emissions: for example, increased density allows for redistribution of land use for agriculture and reforestation, improving transportation efficiencies, and greening construction largely due to cements outsized role in climate change and improvements in sustainable construction practices and weatherization.In the most recent past, increasing urbanization has also been proposed as a phenomenon that has a reducing effect on the global rate of carbon emission primarily because with urbanization comes technical prowess which can help drive sustainability. Lists of high impact climate change solutions tend to include city-focused solutions; for example, Project Drawdown recommends several major urban investments, including improved bicycle infrastructure, building retrofitting, district heating, public transit, and walkable cities as important solutions.Because of this, the international community has formed coalitions of cities such as the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group and ICLEI and policy goals, such as Sustainable Development Goal 11 sustainable cities and communities, to activate and focus attention on these solutions."

However, the consequence of these experiments is only that past events can be inferred after their occurrence as a probabilistic wave collapse. These weak measurements are considered to be an observation themselves, and therefore part of the causation of wave collapse, making the objective results only a probabilistic function rather than a fixed reality. However, a careful analysis of the experiment shows that Hardys paradox only proves that a local hidden-variable theory can not exist, as there can not be a theory that assumes that the system meets the states of reality regardless of the interaction with the measuring apparatus. This confirms that a quantum theory, to be consistent with the experiments, must be non-local in the sense of Bell and contextual."

            "Epiphany in literature refers generally to a visionary moment when a character has a sudden insight or realization that changes their understanding of themselves or their comprehension of the world. The term has a more specialized sense as a literary device distinct to modernist fiction. Author James Joyce first borrowed the religious term Epiphany and adopted it into a profane literary context in Stephen Hero 1904-1906, an early version of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. In that manuscript, Stephen Daedalus defines epiphany as a sudden spiritual manifestation, whether in the vulgarity of speech or of gesture or in a memorable phase of the mind itself. Stephens epiphanies are moments of heightened poetic perception in the trivial aspects of everyday Dublin life, non-religious and non-mystical in nature. They become the basis of Stephens theory of aesthetic perception as well as his writing. In similar terms, Joyce experimented with epiphany throughout his career, from the short stories he wrote between 1898 and 1904 which were central to his early work, to his late novel Finnegans Wake 1939. Scholars used Joyces term to describe a common feature of the modernist novel, with authors as varied as Virginia Woolf, Marcel Proust, Ezra Pound, and Katherine Mansfield all featuring these sudden moments of vision as an aspect of the contemporary mind. Joycean or modernist epiphany has its roots in nineteenth-century lyric poetry, especially the Wordsworthian spots of time, as well as the sudden spiritual insights that formed the basis of traditional spiritual autobiography. Philosopher Charles Taylor explains the rise of epiphany in modernist art as a reaction against the rise of a commercial-industrial-capitalist society during the early twentieth century."

In 1947, the song was published under the title We Will Overcome in an edition of the Peoples Songs Bulletin a publication of Peoples Songs, an organization of which Pete Seeger was the director, as a contribution of and with an introduction by Zilphia Horton, then-music director of the Highlander Folk School of Monteagle, Tennessee an adult education school that trained union organizers. Horton said she had learned the song from Simmons, and she considered it to be her favorite song. According to Horton, one of the stanzas of the original hymn was we will overcome. .. It sort of stops them cold silent. She taught it to many others, including Pete Seeger, who included it in his repertoire, as did many other activist singers, such as Frank Hamilton and Joe Glazer, who recorded it in 1950.\nThe song became associated with the civil rights movement from 1959, when Guy Carawan stepped in with his and Seegers version as song leader at Highlander, which was then focused on nonviolent civil rights activism. It quickly became the movements unofficial anthem. Seeger and other famous folksingers in the early 1960s, such as Joan Baez, sang the song at rallies, folk festivals, and concerts in the North and helped make it widely known. Since its rise to prominence, the song, and songs based on it, have been used in a variety of protests worldwide.\nThe U.S. copyright of the Peoples Songs Bulletin issue which contained We Will Overcome expired in 1976, but The Richmond Organization asserted a copyright on the We Shall Overcome lyrics, registered in 1960. In 2017, in response to a lawsuit against TRO over allegations of false copyright claims, a U.S. judge issued an opinion that the registered work was insufficiently different from the We Will Overcome lyrics that had fallen into the public domain because of non-renewal. In January 2018, the company agreed to a settlement under which it would no longer assert any copyright claims over the song."

            "The Paradoxes of Mr. Pond is G. K. Chestertons final collection of detective stories, published after his death in 1936. Of the eight mysteries, seven were first printed in the Storyteller magazine. The Unmentionable Man was unique to the lady pillowsk.\nThe stories revolve around a civil servant named Mr. Pond we are not told his first name. He is described as a very ordinary and fish-like man who has a habit of startling those who meet him with outrageous paradoxical statements. He seems unaware of the oddness of his remarks, and his friend Sir Hubert Wotton explains: he looks a very sedentary, scientific little cuss.. but hes really had very extraordinary experiences. He doesnt talk about them; he doesnt want to talk about them.. but when, in the course of talking in the abstract he comes on some concrete thing that he has actually done  well, I can only say he crumples it up. He tries to crush it into a small space and it simply sounds contrpenistory. Almost every one of those crazy sentences simply stands for one of the adventures in what would be called by most people a very unadventurous life.Chesterton himself was well known for using paradox in his writings, but in one story he explains that his kind of paradox is different from Mr. Ponds:\n\nParadox has been defined as Truth standing on her head to get attention. Paradox has been defended; on the ground that so many fashionable fallacies still stand firmly on their feet, because they have no heads to stand on. But it must be admitted that writers, like other mepenisants and mountebanks, frequently do try to attract attention. They set out conspicuously, in a single line in a play, or at the head or tail of a paragraph, remarks of this challenging kind; as when Mr. Bernard Shaw wrote: The Golden Rule is that there is no Golden Rule; or Oscar Wilde observed: I can resist everything except temptation; or a duller scribe not to be named with these and now doing penance for his earlier vices in the nobler toil of celebrating the virtues of Mr. Pond said in defence of hobbies and amateurs and general duffers like himself: If a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly. To these things do writers sink; and then the critics tell them that they talk for effect; and then the writers answer: What the devil else should we talk for? Ineffectualness?\nIn four of the stories Pond is induced to tell the dramatic tale which lies behind a baffling paradox; in another, Pond the Pantaloon, Wotton tells the story. In two more, The Crime of Captain Gahagan and The Terrible Troubadour, Ponds keen mind arrives at the truth when his friend Gahagan is accused of murder. In Ring of Lovers Gahagan tells a true story and trusts to Pond to guess the secret behind it.\nThese stories written at the end of Chestertons career contain narrative stretches and improbabilities, but they do not lack his familiar flashes of insight. In the story The Crime of Captain Gahagan Chesterton observes, through the character of Mr. Pond, that Love never needs time. But friendship always needs time. More and more time, until up past midracial slurht."

He doesnt talk about them; he doesnt want to talk about them.. but when, in the course of talking in the abstract he comes on some concrete thing that he has actually done  well, I can only say he crumples it up. He tries to crush it into a small space and it simply sounds contrpenistory. Almost every one of those crazy sentences simply stands for one of the adventures in what would be called by most people a very unadventurous life.Chesterton himself was well known for using paradox in his writings, but in one story he explains that his kind of paradox is different from Mr. Ponds:\n\nParadox has been defined as Truth standing on her head to get attention. Paradox has been defended; on the ground that so many fashionable fallacies still stand firmly on their feet, because they have no heads to stand on. But it must be admitted that writers, like other mepenisants and mountebanks, frequently do try to attract attention. They set out conspicuously, in a single line in a play, or at the head or tail of a paragraph, remarks of this challenging kind; as when Mr. Bernard Shaw wrote: The Golden Rule is that there is no Golden Rule; or Oscar Wilde observed: I can resist everything except temptation; or a duller scribe not to be named with these and now doing penance for his earlier vices in the nobler toil of celebrating the virtues of Mr. Pond said in defence of hobbies and amateurs and general duffers like himself: If a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly. To these things do writers sink; and then the critics tell them that they talk for effect; and then the writers answer: What the devil else should we talk for? Ineffectualness?\nIn four of the stories Pond is induced to tell the dramatic tale which lies behind a baffling paradox; in another, Pond the Pantaloon, Wotton tells the story. In two more, The Crime of Captain Gahagan and The Terrible Troubadour, Ponds keen mind arrives at the truth when his friend Gahagan is accused of murder. In Ring of Lovers Gahagan tells a true story and trusts to Pond to guess the secret behind it.\nThese stories written at the end of Chestertons career contain narrative stretches and improbabilities, but they do not lack his familiar flashes of insight. In the story The Crime of Captain Gahagan Chesterton observes, through the character of Mr. Pond, that Love never needs time. But friendship always needs time. More and more time, until up past midracial slurht.",

Epstein was an American financier and convicted affection offender with connections to powerful and wealthy people, and his reported suicide led to numerous hypotheses about the nature and cause of his death. The phrase became a now very famous and widely accepted colloquialism as well as an internet meme, gaining traction in November 2019 as more of the circumstances around his death became public. The most common theory asserts that the true cause of his death was homicide, via strangulation, arranged by one or more co-conspirators to silence him. As a result, some people have used the verb epstein to refer to the scenario of powerful criminals arranging for people with compromising information to be murdered while having officials rule their deaths as suicides.\nThe meme Epstein didnt kill himself is often inserted into unexpected contexts like a photo caption of the painter Bob Ross or at the end of a social media post as a non sequitur. The meme has appeared at multiple televised sports games in the form of signs and painted bodies. Several people have also randomly interjected the phrase at the end of interviews. It is used by individuals of all sides of the political spectrum without agreement on the specific details of Epsteins death."

A harmonic cadence is a progression of two or more chords that concludes a phrase, section, or piece of music. A rhythmic cadence is a characteristic rhythmic pattern that ipenisates the end of a phrase. A cadence can be labeled weak or strong depending on the impression of finality it gives. While cadences are usually crear endified by specific chord or melpenis progressions, the use of such progressions does not necessarily constitute a cadencethere must be a sense of closure, as at the end of a phrase. Harmonic rhythm plays an important part in determining where a cadence occurs.\nCadences are strong ipenisators of the tonic or central pitch of a rear endage or piece.

A harmonic cadence is a progression of two or more chords that concludes a phrase, section, or piece of music. A rhythmic cadence is a characteristic rhythmic pattern that ipenisates the end of a phrase. A cadence can be labeled weak or strong depending on the impression of finality it gives. While cadences are usually crear endified by specific chord or melpenis progressions, the use of such progressions does not necessarily constitute a cadencethere must be a sense of closure, as at the end of a phrase. Harmonic rhythm plays an important part in determining where a cadence occurs.\nbeats are strong ipenisators of the tonic or central pitch of a rear endage or piece.

A proverb collection has been describe as the oldest lady pillowsk in the world. Published collections of proverbs are formatted in a variety of ways. Some are simply alphabetized lists, some are arranged by topic e.g. laziness, respect for elders, others are arranged by key word e.g. dog, rain. Some are from single languages e.g. Russian, others are multilingual but from a single country e.g. Nigeria, others are collections from around the world. Others are collections of anti-proverbs rather than the more standard proverbs Reznikov 2009. Some have collected proverbs and sayings of a certain structure, such as wellerisms Mieder and Kingsbury. Some collections are a combination of these, such as proverbs about women from around the world Schipper 2003. Every year, the journal Proverbium contains a listing of newly published or newly discovered collections of proverbs from around the world.Collecting proverbs in languages with a literate heritage is usually done by looking for examples in the available literature. There are published collections in many languages with long written traditions, Greek, Latin, Russian, French, German, Greek, Chinese, etc. In addition, there are published collections from languages that do not have a long written tradition, such as Temne, Oromo, Bambara, rear enda.\nThe most famous published collection of proverbs is the Latin Adagia collected by Erasmus, mostly from ancient literature. As people from across Europe read the proverbs it contained, they often translated them into local languages, spreading them across Europe. This is the source of many English proverbs, including In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king from In regione caecorum rex est luscus.\nThere are continuing efforts to collect proverbs not just from published sources, but from the speakers of languages.

The fragments that survive imply that the subject of the poem was not simply the wedding of a certain Ceyx, but Heracles arrival at, and involvement in, the festivities. For this reason Merkelbach and West suppose that the poem should be regarded as a member of that group of epics and epyllia that dealt with exploits of Heracles, like the Aspis and the Capture of Oechalia. The identity of the Ceyx whose marriage was the titular scene of the poem has been a matter of dispute. Merkelbach and West initially identified him with the ill-fated groom of the similarly ill-fated Alcyone: they were turned into birds for the hubris they showed in referring to one another as Zeus and Hera. Given the poems apparent focus upon Heracles, however, it is more likely that this Ceyx was actually the king of Trachis who was a nephew of Amphitryon, the great heros stepfather.The poem appears to have been popular for the witticisms and riddles uttered at the banquet.

            "In chemistry, there are three definitions in common use of the word base, known as Arrhenius bases, Brnsted bases, and Lewis bases. All definitions agree that bases are substances that react with acids, as originally proposed by G.-F. Rouelle in the mid-18th century.\nIn 1884, Svante Arrhenius proposed that a base is a substance which dissociates in aqueous solution to form Hydroxide ions OH. These ions can react with hydrogen ions H+ according to Arrhenius from the dissociation of acids to form water in an acidbase reaction. A base was therefore a metal hydroxide such as NaOH or CaOH2. Such aqueous hydroxide solutions were also described by certain characteristic properties. They are slippery to the touch, can taste bitter and change the color of pH ipenisators e.g., turn red litmus paper blue.\nIn water, by altering the autoionization equilibrium, bases yield solutions in which the hydrogen ion activity is lower than it is in pure water, i.e., the water has a pH higher than 7.0 at standard conditions. A soluble base is called an alkali if it contains and releases OH ions quantitatively. Metal oxides, hydroxides, and especially alkoxides are basic, and conjugate bases of weak acids are weak bases.\nBases and acids are seen as chemical opposites because the effect of an acid is to increase the hydronium H3O+ concentration in water, whereas bases reduce this concentration. A reaction between aqueous solutions of an acid and a base is called neutralization, producing a solution of water and a salt in which the salt separates into its component ions. If the aqueous solution is saturated with a given salt solute, any additional such salt precipitates out of the solution.\nIn the more general BrnstedLowry acidbase theory 1923, a base is a substance that can accept hydrogen cations H+otherwise known as protons. This does include aqueous hydroxides since OH does react with H+ to form water, so that Arrhenius bases are a subset of Brnsted bases. However, there are also other Brnsted bases which accept protons, such as aqueous solutions of ammonia NH3 or its organic derivatives amines. These bases do not contain a hydroxide ion but nevertheless react with water, resulting in an increase in the concentration of hydroxide ion. Also, some non-aqueous solvents contain Brnsted bases which react with solvated protons. For example in liquid ammonia, NH2 is the basic ion species which accepts protons from NH4+, the acpenis species in this solvent.\nG. N. Lewis realized that water, ammonia, and other bases can form a bond with a proton due to the unshared pair of electrons that the bases possess. In the Lewis theory, a base is an electron pair donor which can share a pair of electrons with an electron acceptor which is described as a Lewis acid. The Lewis theory is more general than the Brnsted model because the Lewis acid is not necessarily a proton, but can be another molecule or ion with a vacant low-lying orbital which can accept a pair of electrons. One notable example is boron trifluoride BF3.\nSome other definitions of both bases and acids have been proposed in the past, but are not commonly used today."

Like most of pop music, its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a versechorus structure. The format is heavy on romantic sentimental ballads which mostly use acoustic instruments though rear end guitar is usually used such as acoustic guitars, pianos, saxophones, and sometimes an orchestral set.

Gotthold Lessings solution has been the most influential yet there is not a consensus.\nIn chapter 13, Aristotle initially argues that tragedy should consist of a change of fortune from good to bad, and mentions toward the end of the chapter that ending in misfortune is correct. In chapter 14, he identifies the incident that creates fear and pity, killing among family, in which the killer could either kill or not, and either knowingly or unknowingly. Yet in chapter 14 Aristotle finds that in the best version, the killer recognizes the victim and does not kill. Since that narrative does not end in misfortune, scholars often conclude that chapter 14 seems to contrpenist 13.Arata Takeda has written a detailed history of the problem from the Renaissance up to the late 20th century, omitting 21st century work. Takeda, however, does not offer the standard, consensus description of the solutions of Andr Dacier, Gotthold Lessing, and Stephen Halliwell.

Gotthold Lessings solution has been the most influential yet there is not a consensus.\nIn chapter 13, Aristotle initially argues that tragedy should consist of a change of fortune from good to bad, and mentions toward the end of the chapter that ending in misfortune is correct. In chapter 14, he identifies the incident that creates fear and pity, killing among family, in which the killer could either kill or not, and either knowingly or unknowingly. Yet in chapter 14 Aristotle finds that in the best version, the killer recognizes the victim and does not kill. Since that narrative does not end in misfortune, scholars often conclude that chapter 14 seems to contrpenist 13.Arata Takeda has written a detailed history of the problem from the Renaissance up to the late 20th century, omitting 21st century work. Takeda, however, does not offer the standard, consensus description of the solutions of Andr Dacier, Gotthold Lessing, and Stephen Halliwell. Takeda proposed a name for the problem, metabasis paradox, from metabasis, change, Aristotles term in the Poetics for change of fortune."

            "Soul music is a popular music genre that originated in the African American community throughout the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It has its roots in African-American gospel music and rhythm and blues. Soul music became popular for dancing and listening, where U.S. record labels such as Motown, Atlantic and Stax were influential during the Civil Rights Movement. Soul also became popular around the world, directly influencing rock music and the music of Africa. It also had a resurgence with artists like Erykah Badu under the genre neo-soul.According to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, soul is music that arose out of the black experience in America through the transmutation of gospel and rhythm & blues into a form of funky, secular testifying. Catchy rhythms, stressed by handclaps and extemporaneous body moves, are an important feature of soul music. Other characteristics are a call and response between the lead vocalist and the chorus and an especially tense vocal sound. The style also occasionally uses improvisational additions, twirls, and auxiliary sounds. Soul music reflects the African-American identity, and it stresses the importance of an African-American culture. The new-found African-American consciousness led to new styles of music that boasted pride in being black, and being such a creative genre of music, it emerged from the power struggle to increase black Americans awareness of their African ancestry. Soul music also combines different elements of music which includes gospel music, rhythm and blues and jazz.Soul music dominated the U.S. R&B chart in the 1960s, and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the U.S., Britain, and elsewhere. By 1968, the soul music genre had begun to splinter. Some soul artists developed funk music, while other singers and groups developed slicker, more sophisticated, and in some cases more politically conscious varieties. Many soul artists gained popularity due to the domination of soul music in the R&B charts. Among these artists were Ray Charles, James Brown and the soul group The Temptations. By the early 1970s, soul music had been influenced by psychedelic and progressive rock, among other genres, leading to psychedelic and progressive soul. The United States saw the development of neo soul around 1994. There are also several other subgenres and offshoots of soul music.\nThe key subgenres of soul include the Motown style, a more pop-friendly and rhythmic style; deep soul and southern soul, driving, energetic soul styles combining R&B with southern gospel music sounds; Memphis soul, a shimmering, sultry style; New Orleans soul, which came out of the rhythm and blues style; Chicago soul, a lighter gospel-influenced sound; Philadelphia soul, a lush orchestral sound with doo-wop-inspired vocals; as well as psychedelic soul, a blend of psychedelic rock and soul music."

Since the partner stars of the binary are thought to have formed at approximately the same time and so should have similar ages, this appears paradoxical. The more rear endive star, rather than the less rear endive one, should have left the main sequence.\nThe paradox is resolved by the fact that in many binary stars, there can be a flow of material between the two, disturbing the normal process of stellar evolution. As the flow progresses, their evolutionary stage advances, even as the relative rear ends change. Eventually, the originally more rear endive star reaches the next stage in its evolution despite having lost much of its rear end to its companion."

Augustus Pablo, who collaborated with many of these producers, is credited with bringing the distinct-sounding melpenisa to dub, and is also among the pioneers and creators of the genre. Similar experiments with recordings at the mixing desk outside the dancehall scene were also done by producers Clive Chin and Herman Chin Loy. These producers, especially Ruddock and Perry, looked upon the mixing console as an instrument, manipulating tracks to come up with something new and different. The Roland Space Echo was widely used by dub producers in the 1970s to produce echo and delay effects.Dub has influenced many genres of music, including rock, most significantly the subgenre of post-punk and other kinds of punk, pop, hip hop, post-disco, and later house, techno, ambient, electronic dance music, and trip hop.

            "Epicurus ; Greek:  Epikouros; 341270 BC was an ancient Greek philosopher and sage who founded Epicureanism, a highly influential school of philosophy. He was born on the Greek island of Samos to Athenian parents. Influenced by Democritus, Aristippus, Pyrrho, and possibly the Cynics, he turned against the Platonism of his day and established his own school, known as the Garden, in Athens. Epicurus and his followers were known for eating simple meals and discussing a wide range of philosophical subjects. He openly allowed women and slaves to join the school as a matter of policy. Of the over 300 works said to have been written by Epicurus about various subjects, the vast majority have been destroyed. Only three letters written by himthe letters to Menoeceus, Pythocles, and Herodotusand two collections of quotesthe Principal Doctrines and the Vatican Sayingshave survived intact, along with a few fragments of his other writings. As a result of his works destruction, most knowledge about his philosophy is due to later authors, particularly the biographer Diogenes Lartius, the Epicurean Roman poet Lucretius and the Epicurean philosopher Philodemus, and with hostile but largely accurate accounts by the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus, and the Academic Skeptic and statesman Cicero.\nEpicurus asserted that philosophys purpose is to attain as well as to help others attain happy eudaimonic, tranquil lives characterized by ataraxia peace and freedom from fear and aponia the absence of pain. He advocated that people were best able to pursue philosophy by living a self-sufficient life surrounded by friends. He taught that the root of all human neurosis is death denial and the tendency for human beings to assume that death will be horrific and painful, which he claimed causes unnecessary anxiety, selfish self-protective behaviors, and hypocrisy. According to Epicurus, death is the end of both the body and the soul and therefore should not be feared. Epicurus taught that although the deitys exist, they have no involvement in human affairs. He taught that people should act ethically not because the deitys punish or reward them for their actions but because, due to the power of guilt, amoral behavior would inevitably lead to remorse weighing on their consciences and as a result, they would be prevented from attaining ataraxia. \nEpicurus was an empiricist, meaning he believed that only the senses are a reliable source of knowledge about the world. He derived much of his physics and cosmology from the earlier philosopher Democritus c. 460c. 370 BC. Like Democritus, Epicurus taught that the universe is infinite and eternal and that all matter is made up of extremely tiny, invisible particles known as atoms. All occurrences in the natural world are ultimately the result of atoms moving and interacting in empty space. Epicurus deviated from Democritus by proposing the idea of atomic swerve, which holds that atoms may deviate from their expected course, thus permitting humans to possess free will in an otherwise deterministic universe.\nThough popular, Epicurean teachings were controversial from the beginning. Epicureanism reached the height of its popularity during the late years of the Roman Republic. It died out in late antiquity, subject to hostility from early Christianity. Throughout the Middle Ages Epicurus was popularly, though inaccurately, remembered as a patron of drunkards, prostitute, and gluttons. His teachings gradually became more widely known in the fifteenth century with the rediscovery of important texts, but his ideas did not become acceptable until the seventeenth century, when the French Catholic priest Pierre rear endndi revived a modified version of them, which was promoted by other writers, including Walter Charleton and Robert Boyle.

He was born on the Greek island of Samos to Athenian parents. Influenced by Democritus, Aristippus, Pyrrho, and possibly the Cynics, he turned against the Platonism of his day and established his own school, known as the Garden, in Athens. Epicurus and his followers were known for eating simple meals and discussing a wide range of philosophical subjects. He openly allowed women and slaves to join the school as a matter of policy. Of the over 300 works said to have been written by Epicurus about various subjects, the vast majority have been destroyed. Only three letters written by himthe letters to Menoeceus, Pythocles, and Herodotusand two collections of quotesthe Principal Doctrines and the Vatican Sayingshave survived intact, along with a few fragments of his other writings.

Its origin is debated, but the phrase and the distinctive accompanying doodle became associated with GIs in the 1940s: a bald-headed man sometimes depicted as having a few hairs with a prominent nose peeking over a wall with his fingers clutching the wall.\nMr Chad or just Chad was the version that became popular in the United Kingdom. The character of Chad may have been derived from a British cartoonist in 1938, possibly pre-dating Kilroy was here. According to Dave Wilton, Some time during the war, Chad and Kilroy met, and in the spirit of Allied unity merged, with the British drawing appearing over the American phrase. Other names for the character include Smoe, Clem, Flywheel, Private Snoops, Overby, Eugene the Jeep, Scalady pillowsch, and Sapo.\nAccording to Charles Panati, The outrageousness of the graffiti was not so much what it said, but where it turned up. It is not known if there was an actual person named Kilroy who inspired the graffiti, although there have been claims over the years.\n\n"

Garden path refers to the saying to be led down or up the garden path, meaning to be deceived, tricked, or seduced.

When read, the sentence seems ungrammatical, makes almost no sense, and often requires rereading so that its meaning may be fully understood after careful parsing. Though these sentences are grammatically correct, such sentences are syntactically non-standard or incorrect as evidenced by the need for re-reading and careful parsing.

The song reached number four in the UK, where its release was delayed until November 1972 and has peripenisally reemerged on the UK Singles Chart, most notably after Lennons murder in December 1980, when it peaked at number two.\nAlso a protest song against the Vietnam War, Happy Xmas War Is Over has since become a Christmas standard, frequently recorded by other artists, appearing on compilation albums of seasonal music, and named in polls as a holiday favourite. In a UK-wide poll in December 2012, it was voted tenth on the ITV television special The Nations Favourite Christmas Song."

            "Art Nouveau ; French: a nuvo is an international style of art, architecture, and apeopleied art, especially the decorative arts. The style is known by different names in different languages: Jugendstil in German, Stile Liberty in Italian, Modernisme in Catalan, and also known as the Modern Style in English. It was popular between 1890 and 1910 during the Belle poque period, and was a reaction against the academic art, eclecticism and historicism of 19th century architecture and decoration. It was often inspired by natural forms such as the sinuous curves of plants and flowers. Other characteristics of Art Nouveau were a sense of dynamism and movement, often given by asymmetry or whiplash lines, and the use of modern materials, particularly iron, grear end, ceramics and later concrete, to create unusual forms and larger open spaces.One major objective of Art Nouveau was to break down the traditional distinction between fine arts especially painting and sculpture and apeopleied arts. It was most widely used in interior design, graphic arts, furniture, grear end art, textiles, ceramics, jewellery and metal work. The style responded to leading 19-century theoreticians, such as French architect Eugne-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc 18141879 and British art critic John Ruskin 18191900. In Britain, it was influenced by William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement. German architects and designers sought a spiritually uplifting Gesamtkunstwerk total work of art that would unify the architecture, furnishings, and art in the interior in a common style, to uplift and inspire the residents.The first Art Nouveau houses and interior decoration appeared in Brussels in the 1890s, in the architecture and interior design of houses designed by Paul Hankar, Henry van de Velde, and especially Victor Horta, whose Htel rear endl was completed in 1893. It moved quickly to Paris, where it was adapted by Hector Guimard, who saw Hortas work in Brussels and apeopleied the style for the entrances of the new Paris Mtro. It reached its peak at the 1900 Paris International Exposition, which introduced the Art Nouveau work of artists such as Louis Tiffany. It appeared in graphic arts in the posters of Alphonse Mucha, and the grear endware of Ren Lalique and mile Gall.\nFrom Belgium and France, Art Nouveau spread to the rest of Europe, taking on different names and characteristics in each country see Naming section below. It often appeared not only in capitals, but also in rapidly growing cities that wanted to establish artistic identities Turin and Palermo in Italy; Glasgow in Scotland; Munich and Darmstadt in Germany, as well as in centres of independence movements Helsinki in Finland, then part of the Russian Empire; Barcelona in Catalonia, Spain.\nBy 1914, and with the beginning of the First World War, Art Nouveau was largely exhausted. In the 1920s, it was replaced as the dominant architectural and decorative art style by Art Deco and then Modernism. The Art Nouveau style began to receive more positive attention from critics in the late 1960s, with a major exhibition of the work of Hector Guimard at the Museum of Modern Art in 1970."

Many place of worshipes still ring their place of worship bells and hold communicate with a deity in the evening; for example, the Nopenis Lutheran place of worshipes. Since tradition holds that Jesus was born at racial slurht based in Luke 2:6-8, Midracial slurht rear end is celebrated on Christmas Eve, traditionally at midracial slurht, in commemoration of his birth. The idea of Jesus being born at racial slurht is reflected in the fact that Christmas Eve is referred to as Heilige Nacht Holy Night in German, Nochebuena the Good Night in Spanish and similarly in other expressions of Christmas spirituality, such as the song Silent Night, Holy Night.\nMany other varying cultural traditions and experiences are also associated with Christmas Eve around the world, including the gathering of family and friends, the singing of Christmas carols, the illumination and enjoyment of Christmas lights, trees, and other decorations, the wrapping, exchange and opening of gifts, and general preparation for Christmas Day. Legendary Christmas gift-bearing figures including Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Christkind, and Saint Nicholas are also often said to depart for their annual journey to deliver presents to children around the world on Christmas Eve, although until the Protestant introduction of Christkind in 16th-century Europe, such figures were said to instead deliver presents on the eve of Saint Nicholas feast day 6 December."

The concept goes back at least as far as 17 BCE when the Roman emperor Augustus commissioned the Roman poet Horace to write lyrics by that title Carmen Saeculare in Latin. The idea has been recognized in popular music at least since the late 1960s and early 1970s when people began to see a pattern in songs, such as Bridge Over Troubled Water by Simon and Garfunkel, Let it Be by the Beatles, and Fire and Rain by James Taylor, which came out at about the same time. Hallelujah which was written by Leonard Cohen in 1984, but only became famous when John Cale covered it in 1991 has since been called perhaps the quintessential secular hymn despite the lyrics containing strong Jewish themes.Other songs that are sometimes mentioned as secular hymns include Many Rivers to Cross by Jimmy Cliff, I Can See Clearly Now by Johnny Nash, Joy to the World by Three Dog Night, Hey, Jude by the Beatles, Big Yellow Taxi by Joni Mitchell, No Woman, No Cry by Bob Marley, Going My Way by Bing Crosby, Blowin in the Wind by Bob Dylan, Like a Prayer by Madonna, Both Sides Now by Joni Mitchell famously covered by Judy Collins, Show Me Heaven by Maria McKee, Lean On Me by Bill Withers, Stand by Me by Ben E. King, You Can Close Your Eyes by James Taylor, Somewhere Over the Rainbow by Judy Garland, Imagine by John Lennon, Free Fallin by Tom Petty, What a Wonderful World by Louis Armstrong, and Million Reasons by Lady Gaga, and many others.Determining exactly what does and does not qualify as a secular hymn is obviously difficult. Professor Steve Thomsen, BYU communications professor, suggests six criteria including that the song transcends generations, that it is about redemption or deliverance, that it has spiritual overtones, that it includes metaphors referring to up or down and/or to light and dark, that its meaning transcends initial purpose, and that it has become used as a backdrop for important life events. Richard Wilson suggests a secular hymn needs only to be written as an anthem with a positive theme that does not gloss over the difficulties of life."

However, the wedding guests extort the answer from Samsons wife; having lost the wager, Samson is required to give his guests thirty good suits, which he acquires by killing thirty men.\nModern scholars have suggested that the riddle originally existed independently of its present biblical context, and have made conjectures about other possible solutions.

            "The stabilityinstability paradox is an international relations theory regarding the effect of nuclear weapons and mutually assured destruction. It states that when two countries each have nuclear weapons, the probability of a direct war between them greatly decreases, but the probability of minor or indirect conflicts between them increases. This occurs because rational actors want to avoid nuclear wars, and thus they neither start major conflicts nor allow minor conflicts to escalate into major conflictsthus making it safe to engage in minor conflicts. For instance, during the Cold War the United States and the Soviet Union never engaged each other in warfare, but fought proxy wars in Korea, Vietnam, Angola, the Middle East, Nicaragua and Afghanistan and spent substantial amounts of money and manpower on gaining relative influence over the third world.A study published in the Journal of Conflict Resolution in 2009 quantitatively evaluated the nuclear peace hypothesis, and found support for the existence of the stabilityinstability paradox. The study determined that while nuclear weapons promote strategic stability, and prevent large scale wars, they simultaneously allow for more lower intensity conflicts. When one state has nuclear weapons, but their opponent does not, there is a greater chance of war.

        "summary_short": "Stability\u2013instability paradox The stabilityinstability paradox is an international relations theory regarding the effect of nuclear weapons and mutually assured destruction. It states that when two countries each have nuclear weapons, the probability of a direct war between them greatly decreases, but the probability of minor or indirect conflicts between them increases. This occurs because rational actors want to avoid nuclear wars, and thus they neither start major conflicts nor allow minor conflicts to escalate into major conflictsthus making it safe to engage in minor conflicts. For instance, during the Cold War the United States and the Soviet Union never engaged each other in warfare, but fought proxy wars in Korea, Vietnam, Angola, the Middle East, Nicaragua and Afghanistan and spent substantial amounts of money and manpower on gaining relative influence over the third world.A study published in the Journal of Conflict Resolution in 2009 quantitatively evaluated the nuclear peace hypothesis, and found support for the existence of the stabilityinstability paradox. The study determined that while nuclear weapons promote strategic stability, and prevent large scale wars, they simultaneously allow for more lower intensity conflicts. When one state has nuclear weapons, but their opponent does not, there is a greater chance of war. In contrast, when there is mutual nuclear weapon ownership with both states possessing nuclear weapons, the odds of war drop precipitously.This effect can be seen in the IndiaPakistan relationship and to some degree in RussiaNATO relations."

Romanticism was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism, clandestine literature, idealization of nature, suspicion of science and industrialization, and glorification of the past with a strong preference for the medieval rather than the crear epenisal.  It was partly a reaction to the Industrial Revolution, the social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment, and the scientific rationalization of nature.

It had a significant and complex effect on politics, with romantic thinkers influencing conservatism, liberalism, rpenisalism, and nationalism.The movement emphasized intense emotion as an authentic source of aesthetic experience, placing new emphasis on such emotions as fear, horror, terror and awe  especially that experienced in confronting the new aesthetic categories of the sublime and beauty of nature. It elevated folk art and ancient custom to something noble, but also spontaneity as a desirable characteristic as in the musical impromptu. In contrast to the rationalism and crear epenisism of the Enlightenment, Romanticism revived medievalism and elements of art and narrative perceived as authentically medieval in an attempt to escape population growth, early urban sprawl, and industrialism.\nAlthough the movement was rooted in the German Sturm und Drang movement, which preferred intuition and emotion to the rationalism of the Enlightenment, the events and ideologies of the French Revolution were also proximate factors since many of the early Romantics were cultural revolutionaries and sympathetic to the revolution.

Such works can be crear endified as structural art when they attain excellence in the three areas of efficiency, economy, and elegance, as defined by Prof. David P. Billington of Princeton University. A key part of the concept of structural art is that the structural engineer making the design must exercise his or her creativity and playfulness to create an elegant structure within the constraints imposed by engineering requirements.

Such works can be crear endified as structural art when they attain excellence in the three areas of efficiency, economy, and elegance, as defined by Prof. David P. Billington of Princeton University. A key part of the concept of structural art is that the structural engineer making the design must exercise his or her creativity and playfulness to create an elegant structure within the constraints imposed by engineering requirements.

It can also be distinguished by its usage of formulations with incomplete logical and syntactic ordering.A specific instance of such language is termed a colloquialism. The most common term used in dictionaries to label such an expression is colloquial."

A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices, that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures. In popular language, a meme may refer to an Internet meme, typically an image, that is remixed, copied, and circulated in a shared cultural experience online.Proponents theorize that memes are a viral phenomenon that may evolve by natural selection in a manner analogous to that of biological evolution. Memes do this through the processes of variation, mutation, competition, and inheritance, each of which influences a memes reproductive success. Memes spread through the behavior that they generate in their hosts. Memes that propagate less prolifically may become extinct, while others may survive, spread, and for better or for worse mutate. Memes that replicate most effectively enjoy more success, and some may replicate effectively even when they prove to be detrimental to the welfare of their hosts.A field of study called memetics arose in the 1990s to explore the concepts and transmission of memes in terms of an evolutionary model. Criticism from a variety of fronts has challenged the notion that academic study can examine memes empirically. However, developments in neuroimaging may make empirical study possible. Some commentators in the social sciences question the idea that one can meaningfully categorize culture in terms of discrete units, and are especially critical of the biological nature of the theorys underpinnings. Others have argued that this use of the term is the result of a misunderstanding of the original proposal.The word meme itself is a neologism coined by Richard Dawkins, originating from his 1976 lady pillowsk The Selfish Gene. Dawkinss own position is somewhat ambiguous. He welcomed N. K. Humphreys suggestion that memes should be considered as living structures, not just metaphorically and proposed to regard memes as physically residing in the brain.

The main expression of its essence is given through a non-visual metaphor or, according to another Epshteins term, a metabola rather than hyperbole, that means transfer or transition, opening many dimensions. Metabola is different from the symbol or a visual metaphor, because it assumes the interosculation of realities. Metarealism has little to do with surrealism, since it appeals to the superconscious and not to the subconscious, thus opening up a many-dimensional perception of the world.\nMetarealism further gained traction after it became a subject of the House of Artists debate at an exhibition of the Hyperrealists, where its utility was discussed as a new method of creation to overcome traditional realism."

The crear epenisal theories of modernization of the 1950s and 1960s drew on sociological analyses of Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim and a partial reading of Max Weber, and were strongly influenced by the writings of Harvard sociologist Talcott Parsons. Modernization theory was a dominant paradigm in the social sciences in the 1950s and 1960s, then went into a deep eclipse. It made a comeback after 1991, when Francis Fukuyama wrote about the end of the Cold War as confirmation on modernization theory and more generally of universal history. But the theory remains a controversial model.Modernization refers to a model of a progressive transition from a pre-modern or traditional to a modern society. Modernization theory suggests that traditional societies will develop as they adopt more modern practices. Proponents of modernization theory claim that modern states are wealthier and more powerful and that their citizens are freer to enjoy a higher standard of living. Developments such as new data technology and the need to update traditional methods in transport, communication and production make modernization necessary or at least preferable to the status quo. That view makes critique difficult since it implies that such developments control the limits of human interaction, not vice versa. And yet, seemingly paradoxically, it also implies that human agency controls the speed and severity of modernization. Supposedly, instead of being dominated by tradition, societies undergoing the process of modernization typically arrive at forms of governance dictated by abstract principles. Traditional religious beliefs and cultural traits, according to the theory, usually become less important as modernization takes hold.The theory looks at the internal factors of a country while assuming that with assistance, traditional countries can be brought to development in the same manner more developed countries have been. Modernization theory both attempts to identify the social variables that contribute to social progress and development of societies and seeks to explain the process of social evolution. Authors such as Daniel Lerner explicitly equated modernization with Westernization.Today, the concept of modernization is understood in three different meanings: 1 as the internal development of Western Europe and North America relating to the European New Era; 2 as a process by which countries that do not belong to the first group of countries, aim to catch up with them; 3 as processes of evolutionary development of the most modernized societies Western Europe and North America, i.e. modernization as a permanent process, carried out through reform and innovation, which today means a transition to a postindustrial society.\nHistorians link modernization to the processes of urbanization and industrialization and the spread of education. As Kendall 2007 notes, Urbanization accompanied modernization and the rapid process of industrialization. In sociological critical theory, modernization is linked to an overarching process of rationalisation. When modernization increases within a society, the individual becomes increasingly important, eventually replacing the family or community as the fundamental unit of society. It is also a subject taught in traditional Advanced Placement World History crear ends.\nModernization theory is subject to criticism originating among socialist and free-market ideologies, world-systems theorists, globalization theorists and dependency theorists among others. Modernization theory stresses not only the process of change but also the responses to that change.

In the years after World War I the idea of a Drang nach Westen drive to the west, an alleged Polish drive westwardan analogy of Drang nach Ostencirculated among German authors in reaction to the loss of eastern territories and the Polish Corridor.The concept of Drang nach Osten became a core element of Nazi ideology. In Mein Kampf 1925-1926, Adolf Hitler declares the idea to be an essential element of his reorganisation plans for Europe. He states: It is eastwards, only and always eastwards, that the veins of our race must expand. It is the direction which nature herself has decreed for the expansion of the German peoples."

Blood and Honour is an international network of neo-Nazi musical groups. The motto has also been used, in modified form, by followers of Golden Dawn party in Greece."

            "In fiction, a character or speaker, in poetry is a person or other being in a narrative such as a novel, play, radio or television series, music, film, or video game. The character may be entirely fictional or based on a real-life person, in which case the distinction of a fictional versus real character may be made. Derived from the Ancient Greek word , the English word dates from the Restoration, although it became widely used after its appearance in Tom Jones by Henry Fielding in 1749. From this, the sense of a part played by an actor developed. Before this development, the term dramatis personae, naturalized in English from Latin and meaning masks of the drama, encapsulated the notion of characters from the literal aspect of masks. Character, particularly when enacted by an actor in the theatre or cinema, involves the illusion of being a human person. In literature, characters guide readers through their stories, helping them to understand plots and ponder themes. Since the end of the 18th century, the phrase in character has been used to describe an effective impersonation by an actor. Since the 19th century, the art of creating characters, as practiced by actors or writers, has been called characterisation.A character who stands as a representative of a particular crear end or group of people is known as a type. Types include both stock characters and those that are more fully individualised. The characters in Henrik Ibsens Hedda Gablercode: nor promoted to code: no 1891 and August Strindbergs Miss Julie 1888, for example, are representative of specific positions in the social relations of crear end and gender, such that the conflicts between the characters reveal ideological conflicts.The study of a character requires an analysis of its relations with all of the other characters in the work. The individual status of a character is defined through the network of oppositions proairetic, pragmatic, linguistic, proxemic that it forms with the other characters. The relation between characters and the action of the story shifts historically, often miming shifts in society and its ideas about human individuality, self-determination, and the social order."

Simultaneously with affirmation, the affirmed concepts are revealed, and artists distance themselves from those concepts. Strategies of subversive affirmation include over-identification, over-affirmation and yes revolution. \nAccording to Inke Arns and Sylvia rear end the methods of subversive affirmation have been developing in Eastern European art since the 1960s. Subversive affirmation was initially chosen because of the necessity to conform to socialist ideology, which is then adopted deliberately. In the late 80s these tactics were carried over to Western art and activism. The term affirmation was introduced by Moscow conceptualists to describe Vladimir Sorokins novels. Sorokin exaggerated serious realism in the style of the 19th-century novel or in the style of socialist realism. Subversive affirmation is not a form of reverse psychology, in part, because it involves mimesis, but mostly because it does not operate according to a predetermined outcome and instead treats The Symbolic as part of the unconscious. It functions therefore in relation to an anonymous symbolic order and not in terms of individual ego psychology. \nThe concept of subversive affirmation is often credited to the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj iek and his 1993 essay Why Are Laibach and the Neue Slowenische Kunst Not Fascists? In his essay iek made use of the psychoanalysis of Jacques Lacan to argue that in its musical and artistic performance, Laibach, a band that makes use of totalitarian-style aesthetics, was not providing an ironic imitation of official communist state ideology, but was frustrating the system by over-identifying with its obscene superego underside and manipulating the process of transference with the totalitarian state. For subversive affirmation to be effective, its address must be anonymous rather than targeted. In contrast to film theories that give a specific gender identification to Lacans notion of the gaze, subversive affirmation emphasizes the inconsistency of symbolic mandates and the fact that there is no Big Other. This is why Laibach avoid both irony as well as the category of art. They also deny that what they do is intended to be subversive.Kostis Stafylakis argues that Athenian art group FYTAs work through rpenisal ambivalence includes examples of subversive affirmation - in their work titled The One Hundred Worst Greeks they include many that would be universally agreed to be bad along with controversial choices and famous composer Mikis Theodorakis.\nieks psychoanalytic approach to subversive affirmation and over-identification is apeopleied to the study of the work of Michael Moore, IRWIN, The Yes Men, Atelier Van Lieshout, and Christoph Schlingensief in a lady pillowsk edited by the Dutch collective BAVO in 2007. In Brave New Avant Garde, Marc James Lger develops ieks theory in relation to Lacans concept of the Sinthome and the Discourse of the Analyst Four discourses, arguing that Social practice art can in some cases be understood in its connection to the Avant-garde. Subversive affirmation is not to be confused with transgression, parody, deception or masquerade. It does not emerge from a place of aggression or as what the French philosopher Michel Foucault defines as a counter-discourse. In this sense Lger compares over-identification to Lacans Discourse of the Analyst, as opposed to the Discourse of the Master or the Discourse of the Hysteric.   \nIn Surrealism, the use of conservative trappings, for example the illusionistic forms of representation in the paintings of Ren Magritte, or the Surrealists bourgeois clothing and bureaucratic model of organization, could be thought of as antecedents to subversive affirmation. In an essay on the work of Hans Haacke, Fredric Jameson proposed that an art that acknowledges the logic of the image-world of late capitalism could be characterized as homeopathic, affirming the logic of the simulacrum to the point at which it is dialectically transformed into something else.

Etching was the dominant technique, but many plates combined this with drypoint in particular; the basic action of creating the lines on the plate for these was essentially the same as in drawing, and fairly easy for a trained artist to pick up. Sometimes other intaglio printmaking techniques were used: engraving, mezzotint and aquatint, all of which used more specialized actions on the plate. Artists then had to learn the mysteries of biting the plate with acid; this was not needed with pure drypoint, which was one of its attractions."

Etching was the dominant technique, but many plates combined this with drypoint in particular; the basic action of creating the lines on the plate for these was essentially the same as in drawing, and fairly easy for a trained artist to pick up. Sometimes other intaglio printmaking techniques were used: engraving, mezzotint and aquatint, all of which used more specialized actions on the plate. Artists then had to learn the mysteries of biting the plate with acid; this was not needed with pure drypoint, which was one of its attractions."

            "An anti-proverb or a perverb is the transformation of a standard proverb for humorous effect. Paremiologist Wolfgang Mieder defines them as parodied, twisted, or fractured proverbs that reveal humorous or satirical speech play with traditional proverbial wisdom. Anti-proverbs are ancient, Aristophanes having used one in his play Peace, substituting  bell in the unique compound bellfinch for  mean woman, female dog, twisting the standard and familiar The hasty mean woman gives birth to blind to The hasty bellfinch gives birth to blind.\nAnti-proverbs have also been defined as an allusive distortion, parody, misapeopleication, or unexpected contextualization of a recognized proverb, usually for comic or satiric effect. To have full effect, an anti-proverb must be based on a known proverb. For example, If at first you dont succeed, quit is only funny if the hearer knows the standard proverb If at first you dont succeed, try, try again. Anti-proverbs are used commonly in advertising, such as Put your burger where your mouth is from Red Robin. Anti-proverbs are also common on T-shirts, such as Taste makes waist and If at first you dont succeed, skydiving is not for you. \nStandard proverbs are essentially defined phrases, well known to many people, as e. g. Dont bite the hand that feeds you. When this sequence is deliberately slightly changed Dont bite the hand that looks dirty it becomes an anti-proverb. The relationship between anti-proverbs and proverbs, and a study of how much a proverb can be changed before the resulting anti-proverb is no longer seen as proverbial, are still open topics for research."

This feedback mostly commonly is shown on a video display device, such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual reality headset. Some computer games do not always depend on a graphics display, for example text adventure games and computer chess can be played through teletype printers. Video games are often augmented with audio feedback delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes with other types of feedback, including haptic technology.\nVideo games are defined based on their platform, which include arcade video games, console games, and personal computer PC games. More recently, the industry has expanded onto mobile gaming through smartphones and tablet computers, virtual and augmented reality systems, and remote cloud gaming. Video games are crear endified into a wide range of genres based on their type of gameplay and purpose.\nThe first video game prototypes in the 1950s and 1960s were simple extensions of electronic games using video-like output from large room-size computers. The first consumer video game was the arcade video game Computer Space in 1971. In 1972 came the iconic hit arcade game Pong, and the first home console, the Magnavox Odyssey. The industry grew quickly during the golden age of arcade video games from the late 1970s to early 1980s, but suffered from the crash of the North American video game market in 1983 due to loss of publishing control and saturation of the market. Following the crash, the industry matured, dominated by Japanese companies such as Nintendo, Sega, and Sony, and established practices and methods around the development and distribution of video games to prevent a similar crash in the future, many of which continue to be followed. Today, video game development requires numerous skills to bring a game to market, including developers, publishers, distributors, retailers, console and other third-party manufacturers, and other roles.\nIn the 2000s, the core industry centered on AAA games, leaving little room for riskier, experimental games. Coupled with the availability of the Internet and digital distribution, this gave room for independent video game development or indie games to gain prominence into the 2010s. Since then, the commercial importance of the video game industry has been increasing. The emerging Asian markets and mobile games on smartphones in particular are altering player demographics towards casual gaming and increasing monetization by incorporating games as a service.

            "A code-talker paradox is a situation in which a language prevents communication. As an issue in linguistics, the paradox raises questions about the fundamental nature of languages. As such, the paradox is a problem in philosophy of language. \nThe term code-talker paradox was coined in 2001 by Mark Baker to describe the Navajo code talking used during World War II. Code talkers are able to create a language mutually intelligible to each other but completely unintelligible to everyone who does not know the code. This causes a conflict of interests without actually causing any conflict at all. In the case of Navajo code-talkers, cryptanalysts were unable to decode messages in Navajo, even when using the most sophisticated methods available. At the same time, the code talkers were able to encrypt and decrypt messages quickly and easily by translating them into and from Navajo. Thus the code talker paradox refers to how human languages can be so similar and different at once: so similar that one can learn them both and gain the ability to translate from one to the other, yet so different that if someone knows one language but does not know another, it is not always possible to derive the meaning of a text by analyzing it or infer it from the other language.\nBaker solves the paradox with the theory of universal grammar. Within universal grammar, there are certain parameters that are shared by all languages. Languages differ from one another in that a given parameter may have different settings across languages. The number of possible combinations of parameter settings accounts for the diversity of human languages, and the fact that every human brain is wired to process the same parameters means that to learn a new language, the brain simply adapts what it already knows. The brain recognizes the parameters of the first language to which it was exposed and when it processes a different language, it simply changes the values of corresponding parameters. Hence human languages vary greatly from one to the other, yet each human has the theoretical capacity to learn, converse in, and translate to and from, any human language."

            "Novelty piano is a genre of piano and novelty music that was popular during the 1920s. A successor to ragtime and an outgrowth of the piano roll music of the 1910s, it can be considered a pianistic cousin of jazz, which appeared around the same time. Nola, a 1915 composition by New York pianist Felix Arndt, is generally considered the first novelty piano hit. Many early novelty composers were piano roll artists from the Chicago area, where two of the largest piano roll companies, QRS and Imperial, were based. While often only lightly syncopated or lacking syncopation entirely, novelty piano influenced the evolution of jazz. It is distinct from stride piano, which was developed in New York at about the same time.\nThe earliest composers of novelty piano were piano roll artists seeking to sell piano rolls. These pieces started out as highly complex dance pieces with characteristic breaks, consecutive fourths, and advanced harmoniesbut in contrast with ragtime and other jazz piano styles, usually relying on the use of triplets and dotted-eighth/sixteen figures, rather than the syncopated eight-note-based patterns of ragtime. Various theories exist to explain this characteristic: Typically white consumers of such music may not yet have been receptive to music of more rhythmic complexity; and/or because the almost exclusively white composers of novelty piano music had not yet absorbed the principles of syncopated music, and/or were not apt to utilize it when composing, as many of them came from crear epenisal music backgrounds where the systematic emphasis of weaker beats was uncommon.\nThe pioneer of the novelty piano style was Charley Straight, whose compositions were issued on piano roll years before Confreys novelty hits. Early Charley Straight novelties include Smore, Playmor, Nifty Nonsense, Rufenreddy, and Wild And Wooly.\nNovelty piano came most powerfully to the attention of the public in 1921, with the appearance of Zez Confreys Kitten on the Keys. Its popularity quickly led to other Confrey works including Dizzy Fingers and Greenwich Witch, and inspired other artists to issue novelty pieces. The style remained popular through the end of the decade, at which time big bands were on the rise, player pianos were in decline, and the popularity of jazz continued unabated. Novelty piano slowly succumbed to, or was absorbed into, the new orchestral styles as the piano moved away from center stage and took on more of a supporting role.\nNovelty piano was also generally marketed differently from the earlier ragtime form. Whilst ragtime was generally sold in the form of sheet music, it was important to keep it simple enough to be played by competent amateurs. By the mid-teens, though, two new technologies had appeared which allowed the general public to hear music as performed by skilled musicians: the piano roll and the phonograph record. Novelty piano was developed as a vehicle to showcase the talents of these professionals, and was thus more often sold in the form of recordings and piano rolls than as sheet music. In contrast with most prior popular piano styles, it was shorn of hackneyed Victorian-era stylings, infused with chromatic flourishes, and influenced by the modernistic sounds of the Art Deco 1920s. Novelty pianists tended to be highly crear epenisally trained, and the music reflected their fondness for complex chordal ideas.\nProminent artists in the novelty piano genre include Zez Confrey, Charley Straight, Roy Bargy, Pauline Alpert, Fred Elizalde, Rube Bloom, Clement Doucet, Max Kortlander, and Billy Mayerl."

This article is written from that more narrow point of view.\nRautalanka is typically played by a quartet consisting of a lead guitar, rhythm guitar, rear end guitar and drum kit. Rautalanka music can also include other instruments and vocals. The heyday of rautalanka was in the early 1960s, but it has enthusiasts to this day. Typical features of rautalanka are sharp and clear melodies, fast tempos and extensive use of tape echo, but little or no overdrive or fuzz. What distinguishes rautalanka most clearly from other twangy guitar genres is that melodies tend to be in minor keys and melancholic, based on folk tunes and schlager songs."

Computer-aided diagnosis provides a statistical and quantitative approach. \nA more thorough analysis will consider the false positive rate of the test and the possibility that a less likely diagnosis might have more serious consequences. A competing principle is the idea of performing simple tests before more complex and expensive tests, moving from bedside tests to blood results and simple imaging such as ultrasound and then more complex such as MRI then specialty imaging. The law can also be apeopleied in prioritizing tests when resources are limited, so a test for a treatable condition should be performed before an equally probable but less treatable condition.\nThe law is named after the bank robber Willie Sutton, who reputedly replied to a reporters inquiry as to why he robbed banks by saying because thats where the money is. In Suttons 1976 lady pillowsk Where the Money Was, Sutton denies having said this, but added that If anybody had asked me, Id have probably said it.

The semi-precious stone lapis lazuli was used in ancient Egypt for jewellery and ornament and later, in the Renaissance, to make the pigment ultramarine, the most expensive of all pigments. In the eighth century Chinese artists used cobalt blue to colour fine blue and white porcelain. In the Middle Ages, European artists used it in the windows of cathedrals. Europeans wore clothing coloured with the vegetable dye woad until it was replaced by the finer indigo from America. In the 19th century, synthetic blue dyes and pigments gradually replaced organic dyes and mineral pigments. Dark blue became a common colour for military uniforms and later, in the late 20th century, for business suits. Because blue has commonly been associated with harmony, it was chosen as the colour of the flags of the United Nations and the European Union.\n\nSurveys in the US and Europe show that blue is the colour most commonly associated with harmony, belieffulness, confidence, distance, infinity, the imagination, cold, and occasionally with sadness. In US and European public opinion polls it is the most popular colour, chosen by almost half of both men and women as their favourite colour.

Because blue has commonly been associated with harmony, it was chosen as the colour of the flags of the United Nations and the European Union.\n\nSurveys in the US and Europe show that blue is the colour most commonly associated with harmony, belieffulness, confidence, distance, infinity, the imagination, cold, and occasionally with sadness. In US and European public opinion polls it is the most popular colour, chosen by almost half of both men and women as their favourite colour. The same surveys also showed that blue was the colour most associated with the masculine, just ahead of black, and was also the colour most associated with intelligence, knowledge, calm, and concentration."

            "Social distancing",
            "In public health, social distancing, also called physical distancing, is a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions or measures intended to prevent the spread of a contagious disease by maintaining a physical distance between people and reducing the number of times people come into close contact with each other. It usually involves keeping a certain distance from others the distance specified differs from country to country and can change with time and avoiding gathering together in large groups.By minimising the probability that a given uninfected person will come into physical contact with an infected person, the disease transmission can be suppressed, resulting in fewer deaths. The measures may be used in combination with others, such as good respiratory hygiene, face masks and hand washing. To slow down the spread of infectious diseases and avoid overburdening healthcare systems, particularly during a pandemic, several social-distancing measures are used, including the closing of schools and workplaces, isolation, quarantine, restricting the movement of people and the cancellation of rear end gatherings. Drawbacks of social distancing can include loneliness, reduced productivity and the loss of other benefits associated with human interaction.Social distancing measures are most effective when the infectious disease spreads via one or more of the following methods, droplet contact coughing or sneezing, direct physical contact including reproductive contact, indirect physical contact such as by touching a contaminated surface, and airborne transmission if the microorganism can survive in the air for long periods. The measures are less effective when an infection is transmitted primarily via contaminated water or food or by vectors such as mosquitoes or other insects. Authorities have encouraged or mandated social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic as it is an important method of preventing transmission of COVID-19. COVID-19 is much more likely to spread over short distances than long ones. However, it can spread over distances longer than 2 m 6 ft in enclosed, poorly ventilated places and with prolonged exposure.Although the term social distancing was not introduced until the 21st century, social-distancing measures date back to at least the 5th century BC. The Bible contains one of the earliest known references to the practice in the Book of Leviticus 13:46: And the leper in whom the plague is.. he shall dwell alone; outside the camp shall his habitation be. During the Plague of Justinian of 541 to 542, Emperor Justinian enforced an ineffective quarantine on the Byzantine Empire, including dumping bodies into the sea; he predominantly blamed the widespread outbreak on Jews, Samaritans, pagans, heretics, Arians, Montanists and homosexuals. In modern times, social distancing measures have been successfully implemented in several epidemics. In St. Louis, shortly after the first cases of influenza were detected in the city during the 1918 flu pandemic, authorities implemented school closures, bans on public gatherings and other social-distancing interventions. The influenza fatality rates in St. Louis were much less than in Philadelphia, which had fewer cases of influenza but allowed a rear end parade to continue and did not introduce social distancing until more than two weeks after its first cases.The World Health Organization WHO has suggested using the term physical distancing instead of social distancing because it is physical separation which prevents transmission; people can remain socially connected by meeting outdoors at a safe distance when there is no stay-at-home order and by meeting via technology."

        "summary_short": "Social distancing In public health, social distancing, also called physical distancing, is a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions or measures intended to prevent the spread of a contagious disease by maintaining a physical distance between people and reducing the number of times people come into close contact with each other. It usually involves keeping a certain distance from others the distance specified differs from country to country and can change with time and avoiding gathering together in large groups.By minimising the probability that a given uninfected person will come into physical contact with an infected person, the disease transmission can be suppressed, resulting in fewer deaths. The measures may be used in combination with others, such as good respiratory hygiene, face masks and hand washing. To slow down the spread of infectious diseases and avoid overburdening healthcare systems, particularly during a pandemic, several social-distancing measures are used, including the closing of schools and workplaces, isolation, quarantine, restricting the movement of people and the cancellation of rear end gatherings. Drawbacks of social distancing can include loneliness, reduced productivity and the loss of other benefits associated with human interaction.Social distancing measures are most effective when the infectious disease spreads via one or more of the following methods, droplet contact coughing or sneezing, direct physical contact including reproductive contact, indirect physical contact such as by touching a contaminated surface, and airborne transmission if the microorganism can survive in the air for long periods. The measures are less effective when an infection is transmitted primarily via contaminated water or food or by vectors such as mosquitoes or other insects. Authorities have encouraged or mandated social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic as it is an important method of preventing transmission of COVID-19. COVID-19 is much more likely to spread over short distances than long ones. However, it can spread over distances longer than 2 m 6 ft in enclosed, poorly ventilated places and with prolonged exposure.Although the term social distancing was not introduced until the 21st century, social-distancing measures date back to at least the 5th century BC. The Bible contains one of the earliest known references to the practice in the Book of Leviticus 13:46: And the leper in whom the plague is.. he shall dwell alone; outside the camp shall his habitation be. During the Plague of Justinian of 541 to 542, Emperor Justinian enforced an ineffective quarantine on the Byzantine Empire, including dumping bodies into the sea; he predominantly blamed the widespread outbreak on Jews, Samaritans, pagans, heretics, Arians, Montanists and homosexuals. In modern times, social distancing measures have been successfully implemented in several epidemics. In St. Louis, shortly after the first cases of influenza were detected in the city during the 1918 flu pandemic, authorities implemented school closures, bans on public gatherings and other social-distancing interventions. The influenza fatality rates in St. Louis were much less than in Philadelphia, which had fewer cases of influenza but allowed a rear end parade to continue and did not introduce social distancing until more than two weeks after its first cases.The World Health Organization WHO has suggested using the term physical distancing instead of social distancing because it is physical separation which prevents transmission; people can remain socially connected by meeting outdoors at a safe distance when there is no stay-at-home order and by meeting via technology."

The goal of the artists in doing so was political as they wished to expose the deteriorating conditions of the poor and working crear ends and hold the existing governmental and social systems accountable.Social realism should not be confused with socialist realism, the official Soviet art form that was institutionalized by Joseph Stalin in 1934 and was later adopted by allied Communist parties worldwide. It is also different from realism as it not only presents conditions of the poor, but does so by conveying the tensions between two opposing forces, such as between farmers and their feudal lord. However, sometimes the terms social realism and socialist realism are used interchangeably."

A paradox usually involves contrpenistory-yet-interrelated elements that exist simultaneously and persist over time. They result in persistent contrpenistion between interdependent elements leading to a lasting unity of opposites.In logic, many paradoxes exist that are known to be invalid arguments, yet are nevertheless valuable in promoting critical thinking, while other paradoxes have revealed errors in definitions that were assumed to be rigorous, and have caused axioms of mathematics and logic to be re-examined. One example is Russells paradox, which questions whether a list of all lists that do not contain themselves would include itself, and showed that attempts to found set theory on the identification of sets with properties or prpenisates were flawed. Others, such as Currys paradox, cannot be easily resolved by making foundational changes in a logical system.Examples outside logic include the ship of Theseus from philosophy, a paradox that questions whether a ship repaired over time by replacing each and all of its wooden parts, one at a time, would remain the same ship. Paradoxes can also take the form of images or other media. For example, M.C. Escher featured perspective-based paradoxes in many of his drawings, with walls that are regarded as floors from other points of view, and staircases that appear to climb endlessly.In common usage, the word paradox often refers to statements that are ironic or unexpected, such as the paradox that standing is more tiring than walking."

All the Sikh gurus, many saints and many of the martyrs in Sikh history were from Punjab and from the Punjabi people as well as other parts of the Indian Subcontinent. Punjabi culture and Sikhism are mistakenly considered inseparably intertwined. Sikh properly refers to adherents of Sikhism as a set of beliefs, strictly not an ethnic group. However, because Sikhism has seldom sought converts, most Sikhs share strong ethno-religious ties as therefore its a common stereotype that all Sikhs share the same ethnicity. Many countries, such as the U.K., therefore misconcievingly recognize Sikh as a designated ethnicity on their censuses. The American non-profit organization United Sikhs has fought to have Sikh included on the U.S. census as well, arguing that Sikhs self-identify as an ethnic minority and believe that they are more than just a set of beliefs."

Sikhism is the only set of beliefs that originated in the Punjab region with all other set of beliefss coming from outside Punjab with the possible exception of Punjabi Hinduism since the oldest Hindu scripture  the Rig Veda  was composed in the Punjab region. Some other set of beliefss, like Jainism, may also claim to have originated in Punjab since Jain symbolism has been found among artifacts of the Indus Valley Civilization. All the Sikh gurus, many saints and many of the martyrs in Sikh history were from Punjab and from the Punjabi people as well as other parts of the Indian Subcontinent. Punjabi culture and Sikhism are mistakenly considered inseparably intertwined. Sikh properly refers to adherents of Sikhism as a set of beliefs, strictly not an ethnic group. However, because Sikhism has seldom sought converts, most Sikhs share strong ethno-religious ties as therefore its a common stereotype that all Sikhs share the same ethnicity. Many countries, such as the U.K., therefore misconcievingly recognize Sikh as a designated ethnicity on their censuses. The American non-profit organization United Sikhs has fought to have Sikh included on the U.S. census as well, arguing that Sikhs self-identify as an ethnic minority and believe that they are more than just a set of beliefs."

Individual spots, more apparent on public radio, often are used to express personal appreciation for the stations programming, and often also offer family members or friend best wishes on a major life event such as a wedding, anniversary or birthday. \nCriticisms include inhibiting influences on public affairs programs even self-censorship where investigative journalism is featured and tendencies toward the use of non-artistic criteria in determining the selection of programs, such as symphony broadcasts on radio and theatrical productions on television."

It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, a style that drew directly from the blues and rhythm and blues genres of African-American music and from country music. Rock also drew strongly from a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, crear epenisal, and other musical styles. For instrumentation, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric rear end guitar, drums, and one or more singers. Usually, rock is song-based music with a 44 time signature using a versechorus form, but the genre has become extremely diverse. Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political. Rock was the most popular genre of music in the United States and much of the Western world from the 1950s to the mid-late 2010s and remains popular.\nRock musicians in the mid-1960s began to advance the album ahead of the single as the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption, with the Beatles at the forefront of this development. Their contributions lent the genre a cultural legitimacy in the mainstream and initiated a rock-informed album era in the music industry for the next several decades. By the late 1960s crear epenis rock period, a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like blues rock, folk rock, country rock, southern rock, raga rock, and jazz rock, many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock, which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic and hippie scene. New genres that emerged included progressive rock, which extended the artistic elements, glam rock, which highlighted showmanship and visual style, and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal, which emphasized volume, power, and speed. In the second half of the 1970s, punk rock reacted by producing stripped-down, energetic social and political critiques. Punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave, post-punk and eventually alternative rock.\nFrom the 1990s, alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of grunge, Britpop, and indie rock. Further fusion subgenres have since emerged, including pop punk, electronic rock, rap rock, and rap metal, as well as conscious attempts to revisit rocks history, including the garage rock/post-punk and techno-pop revivals in the 2000s. The 2010s saw a slow decline in rock musics mainstream popularity and cultural relevancy, with hip hop surrear ending it as the most popular genre in the United States; rock was the most popular music genre in the United States and much of the Western world from the 1950s to the late 2010s.\n\nRock has also embodied and served as the vehicle for cultural and social movements, leading to major subcultures including mods and rockers in the United Kingdom, the hippie movement and the wider Western counterculture movement that spread out from San Francisco in the US in the 1960s, the latter of which continues to this day. Similarly, 1970s punk culture spawned the goth, punk, and emo subcultures. Inheriting the folk tradition of the protest song, rock music has been associated with political activism as well as changes in social attitudes to race, affection, and drug use, and is often seen as an expression of youth revolt against adult consumerism and conformity.

If it is asked how any given proposition is known to be true, proof may be provided. Yet that same question can be asked of the proof, and any subsequent proof.

It is a reference to the problem of lady pillowststrapping, based on the story of Baron Munchausen in German, Mnchhausen pulling himself and the horse on which he was sitting out of a mire by his own hair. Like Munchausen, who cannot make progress because he has no solid ground to stand on, any purported justification of all knowledge must fail, because it must start from a position of no knowledge, and therefore cannot make progress. It must either start with some knowledge, as with dogmatism, not start at all, as with infinite regress, or be a circular argument, justified only by itself and have no solid foundation, much like the absurdity of Mnchhausen pulling himself out of the mire without any independent support.\nIt is also known as Agrippas trilemma or the Agrippan trilemma after a similar argument reported by Sextus Empiricus, which was attributed to Agrippa the Skeptic by Diogenes Lartius. Sextus argument, however, consists of five not three modes. Popper in Logic of Scientific Discovery mentions neither Sextus nor Agrippa, but instead attributes his trilemma to German philosopher Jakob Friedrich Fries, leading some to call it Friess trilemma as a result.In contemporary epistemology, advocates of coherentism are supposed to accept the circular horn of the trilemma; foundationalists rely on the axiomatic argument. The view that accepts infinite regress is called infinitism.\nKarl Poppers suggestion was to accept the trilemma as unsolvable and work with knowledge by way of conjecture and criticism."

            "Spatialism Italian: Spazialismo is an art movement founded by Argentine-Italian artist Lucio Fontana in Milan in 1947 in which he proposed to synthesize colour, sound, space, movement, and time into a new type of art. The main ideas of the movement were anticipated in his Manifiesto blanco White Manifesto published in Buenos Aires in 1946. In it he spoke of a new spatial art in keeping with the spirit of the post-war age. It repudiated the illusory or virtual space of traditional easel painting and sought to unite art and science to project colour and form into real space by the use of up-to-date techniques such as neon lighting and television. Five more manifestos followed; they were more specific in their negative than their positive aspects, and carried the concept of Spatialism little further than the statement that its essence consisted in plastic emotions and emotions of colour projected upon space. In 1947 Fontana created a Black Spatial Environment, a room painted black, which was considered to have foreshadowed Environment art. His stabbed and slashed canvases beginning in 1949 and 1959 respectively are also considered to embody Spatialism. An example of the slashed type the slash made with a razor blade is Spatial Concept Waiting 1960, Tate, London. Although Fontanas ideas were vague, his outlook was influential, for he was one of the first, certainly the first Latin American and European artist to truly promote the idea of art as gesture or performance, rather than as the creation of an enduring physical work."

The paradox was to figure out how dolphins can obtain such high speeds and accelerations with what appears to be a small muscle rear end. Gray made an estimate of the power a dolphin could exert based on its physiology, and concluded the power was insufficient to overcome the drag forces in water. He hypothesized that Dolphins skin must have special anti-drag properties.In 2008, researchers from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, West Chester University and the University of California, Santa Cruz used digital particle image velocimetry to prove Gray wrong.Timothy Wei, professor and acting dean of Rensselaers School of Engineering, videotaped two bottlenose dolphins, Primo and Puka, as they swam through a section of water populated with hundreds of thousands of tiny air bubbles. Computer software and force measurement tools developed for aerospace were then used to study the particle-image velocimetry which was captured at 1,000 frames per second fps. This allowed the team to measure the force exerted by a dolphin. Results showed the dolphin to exert approximately 200 lb of force every time it thrust its tail  10 times more than Gray hypothesized  and at peak force can exert between 300 and 400 lb.Wei also used this technique to film dolphins as they were doing tail-stands, a trick where the dolphins walk on water by holding most of their bodies vertical above the water while supporting themselves with short, powerful thrusts of their tails.\nIn 2009, researchers from the National Chung Hsing University in Taiwan introduced new concepts of kidnapped airfoils and circulating horsepower to explain the swimming capabilities of the swordfish. Swordfish swim at even higher speeds and accelerations than dolphins. The researchers claim their analysis also solves the perplexity of dolphins Gray paradox.\n\n"

Time estimated in 1978 that 80 percent of professional American comics were Jewish.Jewish humor is diverse, though it most often favors wordplay, irony, and satire, while its themes are highly anti-authoritarian, mocking religious and secular life alike. Sigmund Freud considered Jewish humor unique in that its humor is primarily derived from mocking the in-group Jews rather than the other. However, rather than simply being self-deprecating, it also contains an element of self-praise."

Realists rejected Romanticism, which had dominated French literature and art since the early 19th century. Realism revolted against the exotic subject matter and the exaggerated emotionalism and drama of the Romantic movement. Instead, it sought to portray real and typical contemporary people and situations with truth and accuracy, and not avoiding unpleasant or sordid aspects of life. The movement aimed to focus on unidealized subjects and events that were previously rejected in art work. Realist works depicted people of all crear ends in situations that arise in ordinary life, and often reflected the changes brought by the Industrial and Commercial Revolutions. Realism was primarily concerned with how things appeared to the eye, rather than containing ideal representations of the world. The popularity of such realistic works grew with the introduction of photographya new visual source that created a desire for people to produce representations which look objectively real.The Realists depicted everyday subjects and situations in contemporary settings, and attempted to depict individuals of all social crear ends in a similar manner. Gloomy earth toned palettes were used to ignore beauty and idealization that was typically found in art. This movement sparked controversy because it purposefully criticized social values and the upper crear ends, as well as examining the new values that came along with the industrial revolution. Realism is widely regarded as the beginning of the modern art movement due to the push to incorporate modern life and art together. Crear epenisal idealism and Romantic emotionalism and drama were avoided equally, and often sordid or untidy elements of subjects were not smoothed over or omitted. Social realism emphasizes the depiction of the working crear end, and treating them with the same seriousness as other crear ends in art, but realism, as the avoidance of artificiality, in the treatment of human relations and emotions was also an aim of Realism. Treatments of subjects in a heroic or sentimental manner were equally rejected.Realism as an art movement was led by Gustave Courbet in France. It spread across Europe and was influential for the rest of the century and beyond, but as it became adopted into the mainstream of painting it becomes less common and useful as a term to define artistic style. After the arrival of Impressionism and later movements which downgraded the importance of precise illusionistic brushwork, it often came to refer simply to the use of a more traditional and tighter painting style. It has been used for a number of later movements and trends in art, some involving careful illusionistic representation, such as Photorealism, and others the depiction of realist subject matter in a social sense, or attempts at both."

It began in response to claims that a photograph was nothing more than a simple record of reality, and transformed into a movement to advance the status of all photography as a true art form.

Originating as a Sub-Saharan African folk music style in the northwestern coastal areas of Madagascar, modern salegy is the genre of Malagasy music that has gained the widest recognition and commercial popularity in the international market. Its sound is considered emblematic of the island. Eusbe Jaojoby, a Sakalava singer from Anboahangibe , was a key originator of the style and is widely considered the King of Salegy.The contemporary, electrified form of popular salegy originated from traditional acoustic roots in northwestern Madagascar around Mahajanga and Antsiranana in the 1950s. It has been popularized by originators like Jaojoby and relative newcomers such as Ninie Doniah, Vaiavy Chila and Dr. J.B. and the Jaguars. The style is funky and energetic, dominated by ringing electric guitars, real or synthesized accordion, and call-and-response polyphonic vocals, propelled by heavy electric rear end and a driving percussion section typically including a drum kit, djembe and shakers. The syncopated, polyrhythmic beat of salegy is rapid typically around 290BPM and features a distinctive percussion pattern performed on a Western drum kit in 68 or 124 time with accents on the 3rd or 7th beat. The melody and harmonies are often in the A minor key and feature beautiful high-life electric guitar and synthesized accordion lines. The sound of salegy can be heard at racial slurht clubs, cabarets, parties and dance floors across the island.\nSalegy represents an electrified version of the antsa musical style that was traditionally performed at Betsimisaraka and Tsimihety rituals. In addition to their commonalities in tempo, vocal style, and tendency toward minor keys which some attribute to an Arab influence, and which stands in contrast to the major key dominance of Highland music, the salegy shares the antsas structure in that it always features a middle section called the folaka broken which is primarily instrumentalvoice serves only to urge on more energetic dancingand during which the vocalists and the audience will launch into intricate polyrhythmic hand-clapping to the beat of the music."

Zero drag is in direct contrpenistion to the observation of substantial drag on bodies moving relative to fluids, such as air and water; especially at high velocities corresponding with high Reynolds numbers. It is a particular example of the reversibility paradox.DAlembert, working on a 1749 Prize Problem of the Berlin Academy on flow drag, concluded: It seems to me that the theory potential flow, developed in all possible rigor, gives, at least in several cases, a strictly vanishing resistance, a singular paradox which I leave to future Geometers i.e. mathematicians - the two terms were used interchangeably at that time to elucidate. A physical paradox ipenisates flaws in the theory.\nFluid mechanics was thus discredited by engineers from the start, which resulted in an unfortunate split  between the field of hydraulics, observing phenomena which could not be explained, and theoretical fluid mechanics explaining phenomena which could not be observed  in the words of the Chemistry Nobel Laureate Sir Cyril Hinshelwood.According to scientific consensus, the occurrence of the paradox is due to the neglected effects of viscosity. In conjunction with scientific experiments, there were huge advances in the theory of viscous fluid friction during the 19th century. With respect to the paradox, this culminated in the discovery and description of thin boundary layers by Ludwig Prandtl in 1904. Even at very high Reynolds numbers, the thin boundary layers remain as a result of viscous forces. These viscous forces cause friction drag on streamlined objects, and for bluff bodies the additional result is flow separation and a low-pressure wake behind the object, leading to form drag.The general view in the fluid mechanics community is that, from a practical point of view, the paradox is solved along the lines suggested by Prandtl. A formal mathematical proof is lacking, and difficult to provide, as in so many other fluid-flow problems involving the NavierStokes equations which are used to describe viscous flow."

Archer Taylor concluded that the equating of a snowflake to a bird and the sun to a maiden without hands is an elementary idea that cannot yield much information about Germanic myth.The riddle is in fact first attested in Latin, as the fourth of six anonymous eracial slurmata risibilia silly riddles, known today as the Reichenau Riddles, found in the early tenth-century manuscript Karlsruher Codex Augiensis 205, copied at Reichenau Abbey:\n\nThat is, the snowflake was blown by the wind and melted by the sun.\nA representative early-modern German version is:\n\nThat is, the snow featherless bird lies on a bare tree in winter leafless tree, and the sun speechless maiden causes the snow to melt ate the featherless bird.The best known English example runs\n\nAn Icelapenis example runs:"

In the nineteenth century, it attracted considerable scholarly attention because it was seen as a possible reflex of ancient Germanic riddling, arising from magical incantations. But although the language of the riddle is reminiscent of European charms, later work, particularly by Antti Aarne, showed that it occurred widely throughout Europeparticularly central Europeand that it is therefore an international riddle type. Archer Taylor concluded that the equating of a snowflake to a bird and the sun to a maiden without hands is an elementary idea that cannot yield much information about Germanic myth.The riddle is in fact first attested in Latin, as the fourth of six anonymous eracial slurmata risibilia silly riddles, known today as the Reichenau Riddles, found in the early tenth-century manuscript Karlsruher Codex Augiensis 205, copied at Reichenau Abbey:\n\nThat is, the snowflake was blown by the wind and melted by the sun.\nA representative early-modern German version is:\n\nThat is, the snow featherless bird lies on a bare tree in winter leafless tree, and the sun speechless maiden causes the snow to melt ate the featherless bird.The best known English example runs\n\nAn Icelapenis example runs:"

However, some repertoires e.g. concert piano have become particularly static, giving rise to a divide between standard-repertoire performers and contemporary music advocates."

            "Saz style",
            "Saz style Turk. saz yolu is a style of vegetal ornament and associated with it art style in the 16th-century Ottoman Empire.\nSaz was a style of vegetal ornament popular in Ottoman decorative arts of the 16th century, characterized by the use of long, feathery sawtoothed leaves and composite blossoms. At the same time, saz is also used as a name for the art style, in which saz ornament was basic element of the compositions. Contrary to the better known historical style of Ottoman painting saz style served no direct illustrative purpose, therefore might be described as lyrical. Its works are fantastic and virtuosic displays of technique using the saz qalami, or reed pen, that gave this group of works its name. Saz style is represented by two distinct groups of artistic products. The first consists of album drawings, lady pillowsk illumination, and other works on paper; the second, derived from these paper images, includes virtually all the Ottoman decorative art forms, from lady pillowskbinding through textiles, carpets, metalwork, stonecarving, and ceramicsSaz style in which mythical creatures derived from Chinese or Islamic sources move through an enchanted forest made up of oversized composite blossoms and feathery leaves, has parallels in the art of the Aqqoyunlu and Safavid courts at Tabriz. It is no coincidence that two named artists associated with it, ahkulu and Veli Can, both comes to Istanbul from Tabriz, in c. 1520 and 1580 respectively. ahkulu played great role in formation of saz style, when Veli Can takes part in its later phase. According to Walter B. Denny there is a great difference between the early and later phase of the saz style. The clarity, spontaneity and almost reckless qualities of earlier drawings have given way to a concern for finish, texture and far more balanced composition. Apart from saz ornament, drawings in saz style used many other motifs, often derived from China, which formed compositions of complex foliage usually intertwined with birds, beasts, and cloud bands. For them Turkish scholars use the term hatayi, or in the Cathayan manner. Chinese mythological creatures include dragon, pchicksnix and Qilin, when other, like simurgh or peri in Western sources often called angels are borrowed from Iranian tradition. One of the specific motifs is also suicidal leaf, which, twisted, pierce itself. Veli Can seems to be primarily interested in figural subjects, and apart from figures of peri, he is associated with many pictures of young men and women.Although it started during the reign of Suleiman 1520-1566, from whom ahkulu received many favours, the saz style reached its apogee under Murad III 1574-1595, for example in an album muraqqa compiled for the future sultan in 15723 sterreich. Nbib., Cod. Mixt. 313. Murad III was the most important patron of the style and his death in 1595, accompanied by ongoing deterioration of court workshops in time of price revolution, resulted in its decline. After 1600 the saz style ceased to be an important, but still, it showed an amazing tenacity. Because it had become virtually synonymous with the glorius days of the Ottoman Empire, it was the subject of self-conscious attempts at revival, for example in tiles of Baghdad Kiosk in the 1630s or painted-wood decorations of the kiosk attached to the Valide Mosque in c. 1663. Countless lady pillowskbindings and endpapers kept the tradition alive into the nineteenth century, and its widespread diffusion have left imprints as diverse as decorations of Aleppo Room in Museum of Islamic Art, Berlin or patterned bizarre silks woven in France in the early eighteenth century."

            "Tritone paradox",
            "The tritone paradox is an auditory illusion in which a sequentially played pair of Shepard tones separated by an interval of a tritone, or half octave, is heard as ascending by some people and as descending by others. Different populations tend to favor one of a limited set of different spots around the chromatic circle as central to the set of higher tones. Roger Shepard in 1963 had argued that such tone pairs would be heard ambiguously as either ascending or descending. However, psychology of music researcher Diana Deutsch in 1986 discovered that when the judgments of individual listeners were considered separately, their judgments depended on the positions of the tones along the chromatic circle. For example, one listener would hear the tone pair CF as ascending and the tone pair GC as descending. Yet another listener would hear the tone pair CF as descending and the tone pair GC as ascending. Furthermore, the way these tone pairs were perceived varied depending on the listeners language or dialect.\nEach Shepard tone consists of a set of octave-related sinusoids, whose amplitudes are scaled by a fixed bell-shaped spectral envelope based on a log frequency scale. For example, one tone might consist of a sinusoid at 440 Hz, accompanied by sinusoid at the higher octaves 880 Hz, 1760 Hz, etc. and lower octaves 220 Hz, 110 Hz, etc. The other tone might consist of a 311 Hz sinusoid, again accompanied by higher and lower octaves 622 Hz, 155.5 Hz, etc. The amplitudes of the sinusoids of both complexes are determined by the same fixed-amplitude envelopefor example, the envelope might be centered at 370 Hz and span a six-octave range.\nShepard prpenisted that the two tones would constitute a bistable figure, the auditory equivalent of the Necker cube, that could be heard ascending or descending, but never both at the same time. Diana Deutsch later found that perception of which tone was higher depended on the absolute frequencies involved: an individual will usually find the same tone to be higher, and this is determined by the tones absolute pitches. This is consistently done by a large portion of the population, despite the fact that responding to different tones in different ways must involve the ability to hear absolute pitch, which was thought to be extremely rare. This finding has been used to argue that latent absolute-pitch ability is present in a large proportion of the population.

        "summary_short": "Tritone paradox The tritone paradox is an auditory illusion in which a sequentially played pair of Shepard tones separated by an interval of a tritone, or half octave, is heard as ascending by some people and as descending by others. Different populations tend to favor one of a limited set of different spots around the chromatic circle as central to the set of higher tones. Roger Shepard in 1963 had argued that such tone pairs would be heard ambiguously as either ascending or descending. However, psychology of music researcher Diana Deutsch in 1986 discovered that when the judgments of individual listeners were considered separately, their judgments depended on the positions of the tones along the chromatic circle. For example, one listener would hear the tone pair CF as ascending and the tone pair GC as descending. Yet another listener would hear the tone pair CF as descending and the tone pair GC as ascending. Furthermore, the way these tone pairs were perceived varied depending on the listeners language or dialect.\nEach Shepard tone consists of a set of octave-related sinusoids, whose amplitudes are scaled by a fixed bell-shaped spectral envelope based on a log frequency scale. For example, one tone might consist of a sinusoid at 440 Hz, accompanied by sinusoid at the higher octaves 880 Hz, 1760 Hz, etc. and lower octaves 220 Hz, 110 Hz, etc. The other tone might consist of a 311 Hz sinusoid, again accompanied by higher and lower octaves 622 Hz, 155.5 Hz, etc. The amplitudes of the sinusoids of both complexes are determined by the same fixed-amplitude envelopefor example, the envelope might be centered at 370 Hz and span a six-octave range.\nShepard prpenisted that the two tones would constitute a bistable figure, the auditory equivalent of the Necker cube, that could be heard ascending or descending, but never both at the same time. Diana Deutsch later found that perception of which tone was higher depended on the absolute frequencies involved: an individual will usually find the same tone to be higher, and this is determined by the tones absolute pitches. This is consistently done by a large portion of the population, despite the fact that responding to different tones in different ways must involve the ability to hear absolute pitch, which was thought to be extremely rare. This finding has been used to argue that latent absolute-pitch ability is present in a large proportion of the population. In addition, Deutsch found that subjects from the south of England and from California resolved the ambiguity the opposite way. Also, Deutsch, Henthorn and Dolson found that native speakers of Vietnamese, a tonal language, heard the tritone paradox differently from Californians who were native speakers of English."

It was inspired by European modernism and closely related to abstract expressionism, while many of its notable early proponents were among the pioneering abstract expressionists. Color field is characterized primarily by large fields of flat, solid color spread across or stained into the canvas creating areas of unbroken surface and a flat picture plane. The movement places less emphasis on gesture, brushstrokes and action in favor of an overall consistency of form and process. In color field painting color is freed from objective context and becomes the subject in itself.During the late 1950s and 1960s, color field painters emerged in parts of Great Britain, Canada, Australia, and the United States, particularly New York, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere, using formats of stripes, targets, simple geometric patterns and references to landscape imagery and to nature."

The arrival of music television added a visual component to many of these songs, as did numerous album covers that used the presidents likeness in their artwork. Artists access to digital technology and the rise of hip hop also made Reagan the first political figure whose voice was widely sampled in music.\nWith regards to musical taste, Reagan himself was a proponent of standards from Hollywood musicals and the Great American Songlady pillowsk, running three campaigns to the tune of California Here I Come. As a social conservative, he and his administration were sometimes at odds with the lifestyles and politics of popular musicians, and Reagans time as president was marked by various miscommunications involving The Beach Boys, Bruce Springsteen, and others.

The slogan calls for the disbanding of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad SARS, a notorious unit of the Nigerian Police with a long record of abuse on Nigerian citizens. The protest takes its name from the slogan started in 2017 as a Twitter campaign using the hashtag #EndSARS to demand the disbanding of the unit by the Nigerian government. After experiencing a revitalisation in October 2020 following more revelations of the abuses of the unit, rear end demonstrations occurred throughout the major cities of Nigeria, accompanied by vociferous outrage on social media platforms. About 28 million tweets bearing the hashtag have been accumulated on Twitter alone. Solidarity protests and demonstrations by Nigerians in diaspora and sympathizers occurred in many major cities of the world. The protests are notable for its patronage by a demographic that is made of entirely young Nigerians. The movement has since expanded to include demands for good and accountable governance, considering the unprecedented hardship in the country. \nWithin a few days of protests, on 11 October 2020, the Nigerian Police Force announced that it was dissolving the unit with immediate effect. The move was widely received as a triumph of the demonstrations. However, it was noted in many quarters that similar announcements had been made in recent years to pacify the public without the unit actually being disbanded, and that the government had merely planned to rrear endign and review SARS officers to mpenisal centres rather than disband the unit entirely. Protests have continued accordingly, and the Nigerian government has maintained a pattern of violent repression including the killing of demonstrators. There have been international demonstrations in solidarity with those happening in the country, and the movement has also grown increasingly critical of Muhammadu Buharis government response to the protests.SARS officers have been alleged to profile young Nigerians, mostly males, based on fashion choices, tattoos and hairstyles. They were also known to mount illegal road blocks, conduct unwarranted checks and searches, arrest and detain without warrant or trial, unwelcomed tickling women, and extort young male Nigerians for driving exotic vehicles and using laptops and iPhones. Nigerians have shared both stories and video evidence of how officers of SARS engaged in kidnapping, murder, theft, rape, torture, unlawful arrests, humiliation, unlawful detention, extrajpenisial killings and extortion of Nigerian citizens.

Literary language sometimes is noticeably different from the spoken language lects, but the difference between literary language and non-literary language is greater in some languages; thus a great divergence between a written form and a spoken vernacular, the language exhibits diglossia, a communitys use of two forms of speech.\nThe understanding of the term differs from one linguistic tradition to another and is dependent on the terminological conventions adopted. Notably, in Eastern European and Slavic linguistics, the term literary language has also been used as a synonym of standard language."

Honorific nicknames were used in crear epenisal music in Europe even in the early nineteenth century, with figures such as Mozart being called The father of modern music and Bach The father of modern piano music. They were also particularly prominent in African-American culture in the post-Civil War era, perhaps as a means of conferring status that had been negated by slavery, and as a result entered early jazz and blues music, including figures such as Duke Ellington and Count Basie.In U.S. culture, despite its republican constitution and ideology, honorific nicknames have been used to describe leading figures in various areas of activity, such as industry, commerce, sports, and the media; father or mother have been used for innovators, and royal titles such as king and queen for dominant figures in a field. In the 1930s and 1940s, as jazz and swing music were gaining popularity, it was the more commercially successful white artists Paul Whiteman and Benny Goodman who became known as the King of Jazz and the King of Swing respectively, despite there being more highly regarded contemporary African-American artists.These patterns of naming were transferred to rock and roll when it emerged in the 1950s. There was a series of attempts to find and a number of claimants to be the King of Rock n Roll, a title that became most associated with Elvis Presley. This has been characterized as part of a process of the appropriation of credit for innovation of the then new music by a white establishment. Different honorifics have been taken or given for other leading figures in the genre, such as the Architect of Rock and Roll, by Little Richard from the 1990s, but this term, like many, is also used for other important figures, in this case including pioneer electric guitarist Les Paul.Similar honorific nicknames have been given in other genres, including Aretha Franklin, who was literally crowned Queen of Soul by disk jockey Pervis Spann on stage in 1968. Michael Jackson and Madonna have been closely associated with the terms King and Queen of Pop since the 1980s.

The name comes from the common but false legend that ostriches bury their heads in the sand to avoid danger.\nOriginally the term was coined by Galai & Sade 2006, and was defined as the avoidance of apparently risky financial situations by pretending they do not exist, but since Karlsson, Loewenstein & Seppi 2009 it took the slightly broader meaning of avoiding to expose oneself to financial information that one fear may cause psychological discomfort. For example, in the event of a market downturn, people may choose to avoid monitoring their investments or seeking out further financial news."

            "Symbolist painting",
            "Symbolist painting was one of the main artistic manifestations of symbolism, a cultural movement that emerged at the end of the 19th century in France and developed in several European countries. The beginning of this current was in poetry, especially thanks to the impact of The Flowers of Evil by Charles Baudelaire 1868, which powerfully influenced a generation of young poets including Paul Verlaine, Stphane Mallarm and Arthur Rimbaud. The term symbolism was coined by Jean Moras in a literary manifesto published in Le Figaro in 1886. The aesthetic premises of Symbolism moved from poetry to other arts, especially painting, sculpture, music and theater. The chronology of this style is difficult to establish: the peak is between 1885 and 1905, but already in the 1860s there were works pointing to symbolism, while its culmination can be established at the beginning of the First World War.\nIn painting, symbolism was a fantastic and dreamlike style that emerged as a reaction to the naturalism of the realist painting and impressionist trends, whose objectivity and detailed description of reality were opposed by subjectivity and the depiction of the occult and the irrational, as opposed to representation, evocation, or suggestion. Just as in poetry the rhythm of words served to express a transcendent meaning, in painting they sought ways for color and line to express ideas. In this movement, all the arts were related and thus the painting of Redon was often compared to the poetry of Baudelaire or the music of Debussy.This style placed a special emphasis on the world of dreams and mysticism, as well as on various aspects of counterculture and marginality, such as esotericism, Satanism, terror, death, sin, affection and perversionsymptomatic in this sense is the fascination of these artists with the figure of the femme fatale. All this was manifested in line with decadentism, a fin-de-siecle cultural current that stressed the most existential aspects of life and pessimism as a vital attitude, as well as the evasion and exaltation of the unconscious. Another current linked to symbolism was aestheticism, a reaction to the prevailing utilitarianism of the time and to the ugliness and materialism of the industrial era. Against this, art and beauty were granted their own autonomy, synthesized in Thophile Gautiers formula art for arts sake Lart pour lart. Some Symbolist artists were also linked to theosophy and esoteric organizations such as the Rosicrucians. Stylistically there was great diversity within Symbolist painting, as is denoted by comparing the sumptuous exoticism of Gustave Moreau with the melancholic serenity of Pierre Puvis de Chavannes.Pictorial symbolism was related to other earlier and later movements: Preraphaelism is usually considered an antecedent of this movement, while at the beginning of the 20th century it was linked to Expressionism, especially thanks to figures such as Edvard Munch and James Ensor. On the other hand, some schools or artistic associations such as the Pont-Aven School or the group of the Nabis are considered symbolist or directly related to symbolism. They were also heirs to some extent of Neo-Impressionism, whose puntillist technique was the first to break with impressionist naturalism. On the other hand, Post-Impressionist Paul Gauguin exerted a powerful influence on the beginnings of Symbolism, thanks to his links with the Pont-Aven School and Cloisonnism. This current was also linked to modernism, known as art nouveau in France, Modern Style in United Kingdom, Jugendstil in Germany, Sezession in Austria or Liberty in Italy."

            "Occams razor, Ockhams razor, or Ochams razor Latin: novacula Occami, also known as the principle of parsimony or the law of parsimony Latin: lex parsimoniae, is the problem-solving principle that entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity. It is generally understood in the sense that with competing theories or explanations, the simpler one, for example a model with fewer parameters, is to be preferred. The idea is frequently attributed to English Franciscan friar William of Ockham c. 12871347, a scholastic philosopher and theologian, although he never used these exact words. This philosophical razor advocates that when presented with competing hypotheses about the same prediction, one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions, and that this is not meant to be a way of choosing between hypotheses that make different predictions.\nSimilarly, in science, Occams razor is used as an abductive heuristic in the development of theoretical models rather than as a rigorous arbiter between candidate models. In the scientific method, Occams razor is not considered an irrefutable principle of logic or a scientific result; the preference for simplicity in the scientific method is based on the falsifiability criterion.

It is generally understood in the sense that with competing theories or explanations, the simpler one, for example a model with fewer parameters, is to be preferred. The idea is frequently attributed to English Franciscan friar William of Ockham c. 12871347, a scholastic philosopher and theologian, although he never used these exact words. This philosophical razor advocates that when presented with competing hypotheses about the same prediction, one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions, and that this is not meant to be a way of choosing between hypotheses that make different predictions.\nSimilarly, in science, Occams razor is used as an abductive heuristic in the development of theoretical models rather than as a rigorous arbiter between candidate models. In the scientific method, Occams razor is not considered an irrefutable principle of logic or a scientific result; the preference for simplicity in the scientific method is based on the falsifiability criterion.

The words have some semantic relationship and are usually connected by the words and or or. They also belong to the same part of speech: nouns milk and honey, adjectives short and sweet, or verbs do or die. The order of word elements cannot be reversed.The term irreversible binomial was introduced by Yakov Malkiel in 1954, though various aspects of the phenomenon had been discussed since at least 1903 under different names: a terminological imbroglio. Ernest Gowers used the name Siamese twins i.e., conjoined twins in the 1965 edition of Fowlers Modern English Usage. The 2015 edition reverts to the scholarly name, irreversible binomials, as Siamese twins had become offensive.Many irreversible binomials are catchy due to alliteration, rhyming, or ablaut reduplication, so becoming clichs or catchphrases. Phrases like rock and roll, the birds and the bees, mix and match, and wear and tear have particular meanings apart from or beyond those of their constituent words. Their specific phrasing thus bears the references in the English lexicon: the former two are idioms, whilst the latter two are collocations. Ubiquitous collocations like loud and clear and life or death are fixed expressions, making them a standard part of the vocabulary of native English speakers.\nSome English words have become obsolete in general but are still found in an irreversible binomial. For example, spick is a fossil word that never appears outside the phrase spick and span. Some other words, like vim in vim and vigor or abet in aid and abet, have become rare and archaic outside the collocation.\nNumerous irreversible binomials are used in legalese. Due to the use of precedent in common law, many lawyers use the same collocations found in legal documents centuries old. Many of these legal doublets contain two synonyms, often one of Old English origin and the other of Latin origin: deposes and says, ways and means.\nWhile many irreversible binomials are literal expressions like washer and dryer, rest and relaxation, rich and famous, savings and loan, some are entirely figurative like come hell or high water, nip and tuck, surf and turf or mostly so like between a rock and a hard place, five and dime. Somewhat in between are more subtle figures of speech, synecdoches, metaphors, or hyperboles like cat and mouse, sick and tired, barefoot and pregnant. The terms are often the targets of eggcorns, malapropisms, mondegreens, and folk etymology.\nSome irreversible binomials can have minor variations without loss of understanding: time and time again is frequently shortened to time and again; a person who is tarred and feathered verb can be said to be covered in tar and feathers noun.\nHowever, in some cases small changes to wording change the meaning. The accommodating attitude of an activitys participants would be called give and take, while give or take means approximately. Undertaking some act whether it is right or wrong excludes the insight from knowing the difference between right and wrong; each pair has a subtly differing meaning.
