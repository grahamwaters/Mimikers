            "Climate change and cities are deeply connected. Cities are one of the greatest contributors and likely best opportunities for addressing climate change. Cities are also one of the most vulnerable parts of the human society to the effects of climate change, and likely one of the most important solutions for reducing the environmental impact of humans. More than half of the worlds population is in cities, consuming a large portion of food and goods produced outside of cities. The increase of urban population growth is one of the main factors in air-quality problems. In the year 2016, 31 mega-cities reported having at least 10 million in their population, 8 of which surrear endd 20 million people. The UN projects that 68% of the world population will live in urban areas by 2050. Hence, cities have a significant influence on construction and transportationtwo of the key contributors to global warming emissions. Moreover, because of processes that create climate conflict and climate refugees, city areas are expected to grow during the next several decades, stressing infrastructure and concentrating more impoverished peoples in cities.Because of the high density and effects like the urban heat island affect, weather changes due to climate change are likely to greatly effect cities, exacerbating existing problems, such as air pollution, water scarcity, and heat illness in the metropolitan areas. Studies have shown that if body temperature exceeds 39C for a period of time, serious heat stroke may occur. Some of the other extreme weather conditions caused by climate change include extreme floods, deathly snowstorms, ice storms, heat waves, droughts, and hurricanes, which are often deathly and harmful. Studies have shown that heat waves are three times more likely to occur and have become more intense since the 1960s. Moreover, because most cities have been built on rivers or coastal areas, cities are frequently vulnerable to the subsequent effects of sea level rise, which cause coastal flooding and erosion, and those effects are deeply connected with other urban environmental problems, like subsidence and aquifer depletion.\nA report by the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group described consumption based emissions as having significantly more impact than production-based emissions within cities. The report estimates that 85% of the emissions associated with goods within a city is generated outside of that city. Climate change adaptation and mitigation investments in cities will be important in reducing the impacts of some of the largest contributors of greenhouse gas emissions: for example, increased density allows for redistribution of land use for agriculture and reforestation, improving transportation efficiencies, and greening construction largely due to cements outsized role in climate change and improvements in sustainable construction practices and weatherization.In the most recent past, increasing urbanization has also been proposed as a phenomenon that has a reducing effect on the global rate of carbon emission primarily because with urbanization comes technical prowess which can help drive sustainability. Lists of high impact climate change solutions tend to include city-focused solutions; for example, Project Drawdown recommends several major urban investments, including improved bicycle infrastructure, building retrofitting, district heating, public transit, and walkable cities as important solutions.Because of this, the international community has formed coalitions of cities such as the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group and ICLEI and policy goals, such as Sustainable Development Goal 11 sustainable cities and communities, to activate and focus attention on these solutions."

The book and series examined the phenomenon of fame and how it expanded to international mass media proportions throughout the 20th century. The series first aired starting in January 1993, with 8 episodes divided in roughly 8 decades, from the 1900s to the 1980s. Each episode highlighted world-famous people during that part of the century. James delivered interesting and amusing comments about the portrayed celebrities and the various ways they became famous.\\nIn the United States, the series were broadcast on PBS and in Australia on ABC, though some footage was occasionally cut if the rights to it were too expensive. The series has never been repeated on television since, which James attributes to the fact that every inch of footage in the gigantic compilation belonged to some agency legally equipped to charge the Earth. He further points out that the book contains the text almost exactly as I read it out on screen. but I took care even at the time to write it as if it might have to survive on its own.\\n\\n"

Typical road users include pedestrians, cyclists, motorists, vehicle passengers, horse riders, and passengers of on-road public transport mainly buses and trams.\\nBest practices in modern road safety strategy: \\n\\nThe basic strategy of a Safe System approach is to ensure that in the event of a crash, the impact energies remain below the threshold likely to produce either death or serious injury. This threshold will vary from crash scenario to crash scenario, depending upon the level of protection offered to the road users involved. For example, the chances of survival for an unprotected pedestrian hit by a vehicle diminish rapidly at speeds greater than 30 km/h, whereas for a properly restrained motor vehicle occupant the critical impact speed is 50 km/h for side impact crashes and 70 km/h for head-on crashes.\\nAs sustainable solutions for classes of road safety have not been identified, particularly low-traffic rural and remote roads, a hierarchy of control should be applied, similar to classifications used to improve occupational safety and health. At the highest level is sustainable prevention of serious injury and death crashes, with sustainable requiring all key result areas to be considered. At the second level is real-time risk reduction, which involves providing users at severe risk with a specific warning to enable them to take mitigating action. The third level is about reducing the crash risk which involves applying the road-design standards and guidelines such as from AASHTO, improving driver behavior and enforcement.Traffic safety has been studied as a science for more than 75 years."

The OWS slogan, We are the 99%, refers to income and wealth inequality in the U.S. between the wealthiest 1% and the rest of the population. To achieve their goals, protesters acted on consensus-based decisions made in general assemblies which emphasized redress through direct action over the petitioning to authorities.The protesters were forced out of Zuccotti Park on November 15, 2011. Protesters then turned their focus to occupying banks, corporate headquarters, board meetings, foreclosed homes, college and university campuses and social media."

            "Snuff tobacco, Snuff is a smokeless tobacco made from finely ground or pulverized tobacco leaves.\\nIt is inhaled or sniffed alternatively sometimes written as snuffed into the nasal cavity, delivering a swift hit of nicotine and a lasting flavored scent especially if flavoring has been blended with the tobacco. Traditionally, it is sniffed or inhaled lightly after a pinch of snuff is either placed onto the back surface of the hand, held pinched between thumb and index finger, or held by a specially made snuffing device.\\nSnuff originated in the Americas and was in common use in Europe by the 17th century. Traditional snuff production consists of a lengthy, multi-step process, in tobacco snuff mills. The selected tobacco leaves are first subject to special tobacco curing or fermentation processes, where they will later provide the individual characteristics and flavor for each type of snuff blend. Snuff is usually scented or flavored, with many blends of snuff requiring months to years of special storage to reach the required maturity. Typical traditional flavors are varieties of blended tobacco leaves considered original fine snuff without any addition of scents or essences. Varieties of spice, piquant, fruit, floral, and mentholated also called medicated soon followed, either pure or in blends. Each snuff manufacturer usually has a variety of unique recipes and blends, as well as special recipes for individual customers. Common flavors also include coffee, chocolate, bordeaux, honey, vanilla, cherry, orange, apricot, plum, camphor, cinnamon, rose and spearmint. Modern flavors include bourbon, cola and whisky. Traditional classic German snuff blends are the pungent and sharp Schmalzler and Brasil blends.\\nSnuff comes in a range of texture and moistness, from very fine to coarse, and from toast very dry to very moist. Often drier snuffs are ground more finely. There is also a range of tobacco-free snuffs, such as Pschls Weiss White, made from glucose powder or herbs. While strictly speaking, these are not snuffs because they contain no tobacco, they are an alternative for those who wish to avoid nicotine, or for cutting a strong snuff to an acceptable strength."

Mountbatten, who was of German descent, was born in the United Kingdom to the prominent Battenberg family and was a maternal uncle of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and a second cousin of King George VI. He joined the Royal Navy during the First World War and was appointed Supreme Allied Commander, South East Asia Command, in the Second World War. He later served as the last Viceroy of British India and briefly as the first Governor-General of the Dominion of India.\\nMountbatten attended the Royal Naval College, Osborne, before entering the Royal Navy in 1916. He saw action during the closing phase of the First World War, and after the war briefly attended Christs College, Cambridge. During the interwar period, Mountbatten continued to pursue his naval career, specialising in naval communications.\\nFollowing the outbreak of the Second World War, Mountbatten commanded the destroyer HMS Kelly and the 5th Destroyer Flotilla. He saw considerable action in Norway, in the English Channel, and in the Mediterranean. In August 1941, he received command of the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious. He was appointed chief of Combined Operations and a member of the Chiefs of Staff Committee in early 1942, and organised the raids on St Nazaire and Dieppe. In August 1943, Mountbatten became Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia Command and oversaw the recapture of Burma and Singapore from the Japanese by the end of 1945. For his service during the war, Mountbatten was created viscount in 1946 and earl the following year.\\nIn March 1947, Mountbatten was appointed Viceroy of India and oversaw the Partition of India into India and Pakistan.

            "The Rite of Spring, The Rite of Spring French: Le Sacre du printemps is a ballet and orchestral concert work by the Russian composer Igor Stravinsky. It was written for the 1913 Paris season of Sergei Diaghilevs Ballets Russes company; the original choreography was by Vaslav Nijinsky with stage designs and costumes by Nicholas Roerich. When first performed at the Thtre des Champs-lyses on 29 May 1913, the avant-garde nature of the music and choreography caused a sensation. Many have called the first-night reaction a riot or near-riot, though this wording did not come about until reviews of later performances in 1924, over a decade later. Although designed as a work for the stage, with specific passages accompanying characters and action, the music achieved equal if not greater recognition as a concert piece and is widely considered to be one of the most influential musical works of the 20th century.\\nStravinsky was a young, virtually unknown composer when Diaghilev recruited him to create works for the Ballets Russes. Le Sacre du printemps was the third such major project, after the acclaimed Firebird 1910 and Petrushka 1911. The concept behind The Rite of Spring, developed by Roerich from Stravinskys outline idea, is suggested by its subtitle, Pictures of Pagan Russia in Two Parts; the scenario depicts various primitive rituals celebrating the advent of spring, after which a young girl is chosen as a sacrificial victim and dances herself to death. After a mixed critical reception for its original run and a short London tour, the ballet was not performed again until the 1920s, when a version choreographed by Lonide Massine replaced Nijinskys original, which saw only eight performances. Massines was the forerunner of many innovative productions directed by the worlds leading choreographers, gaining the work worldwide acceptance. In the 1980s, Nijinskys original choreography, long believed lost, was reconstructed by the Joffrey Ballet in Los Angeles.\\nStravinskys score contains many novel features for its time, including experiments in tonality, metre, rhythm, stress and dissonance. Analysts have noted in the score a significant grounding in Russian folk music, a relationship Stravinsky tended to deny. Regarded as among the first modernist works, the music influenced many of the 20th-centurys leading composers and is one of the most recorded works in the classical repertoire."

            "Spider-Man, Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 August 1962 in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He has since been featured in films, television shows, novels, video games, and plays. Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker, an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues and gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black Cat; and foes such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin, and Venom. In his origin story, Spider-Man gets superhuman spider-powers and abilities from a bite from a radioactive spider; these include clinging to surfaces and ceilings, superhuman strength, speed, and agility, and detecting danger with his precognition ability called spider-sense. He also builds wrist-mounted web-shooter devices that shoot artificial spider-webs of his own design that were meant to be used for fighting his enemies and web-swinging across the city. After his personal tragedy of his late Uncle Ben, Peter began using his spider-powers to fight against crime as Spider-Man.\\nWhen Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist. The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker, a high school student from Queens, New York, as Spider-Mans secret identity, whose self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness were issues to which young readers could relate. While Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick, unlike previous teen heroes such as Bucky and Robin, Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman; he thus had to learn for himself that with great power comes great responsibility a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man story but later retroactively attributed to his guardian, his late Uncle Ben Parker.\\nMarvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series, the first and longest-lasting of which is The Amazing Spider-Man. Over the years, the Peter Parker character developed from a shy, nerdy New York City high school student to a troubled but outgoing college student, to a married high school teacher to, in the late 2000s, a single freelance photographer. In the 2000s, he joins the Avengers. Doctor Octopus also took on the identity for a story arc spanning 20122014, following a body swap plot in which Peter appears to die. Marvel has also published books featuring alternate versions of Spider-Man, including Spider-Man 2099, which features the adventures of Miguel OHara, the Spider-Man of the future; Ultimate Spider-Man, which features the adventures of a teenaged Peter Parker in an alternate universe; and Ultimate Comics Spider-Man, which depicts the teenager Miles Morales, who takes up the mantle of Spider-Man after Ultimate Peter Parkers supposed death. Miles later became a popular superhero in his own right and was brought into the mainstream continuity, where he sometimes works alongside Peter.\\nSpider-Man is one of the most popular and commercially successful superheroes. He has appeared in countless forms of media, including several animated TV series, a live-action television series, syndicated newspaper comic strips, and multiple series of films. The character was first portrayed in live-action by Danny Seagren in Spidey Super Stories, a The Electric Company skit which ran from 1974 to 1977. In films, Spider-Man has been portrayed by actors Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, and in the Marvel Cinematic Universe by Tom Holland. He was voiced by Chris Pine and Jake Johnson in the animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse 2018, with Johnson reprising the role in its sequel Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse 2023. Reeve Carney starred originally as Spider-Man in the 2010 Broadway musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark. Spider-Man has been well-received as a superhero and comic book character, and he is often ranked as one of the most popular and iconic comic book characters of all time and one of the most popular characters in all fiction."

Filmed and set during World War II, it focuses on an American expatriate Bogart who must choose between his love for a woman Bergman or helping her husband Henreid, a Czech resistance leader, escape from the Vichy-controlled city of Casablanca to continue his fight against the Germans. The screenplay is based on Everybody Comes to Ricks, an unproduced stage play by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison. The supporting cast features Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Dooley Wilson.\\nWarner Bros. story editor Irene Diamond convinced producer Hal B. Wallis to purchase the film rights to the play in January 1942. Brothers Julius and Philip G. Epstein were initially assigned to write the script. However, despite studio resistance, they left to work on Frank Capras Why We Fight series early in 1942. Howard Koch was assigned to the screenplay until the Epsteins returned a month later. Principal photography began on May 25, 1942, ending on August 3; the film was shot entirely at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California, with the exception of one sequence at Van Nuys Airport in Van Nuys, Los Angeles.\\nAlthough Casablanca was an A-list film with established stars and first-rate writers, no one involved with its production expected it to stand out among the hundreds of pictures produced by Hollywood yearly. Casablanca was rushed into release to take advantage of the publicity from the Allied invasion of North Africa a few weeks earlier. It had its world premiere on November 26, 1942, in New York City and was released nationally in the United States on January 23, 1943. The film was a solid if unspectacular success in its initial run.\\nExceeding expectations, Casablanca went on to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, while Curtiz was selected as Best Director and the Epsteins and Koch were honored for Best Adapted Screenplay. Its reputation has gradually grown, to the point that its lead characters, memorable lines, and pervasive theme song have all become iconic, and it consistently ranks near the top of lists of the greatest films in history. In 1989, the United States Library of Congress selected the film as one of the first for preservation in the National Film Registry for being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."

Her reign of 63 years and 216 days was longer than that of any previous British monarch and is known as the Victorian era. It was a period of industrial, political, scientific, and military change within the United Kingdom, and was marked by a great expansion of the British Empire. In 1876, the British Parliament voted to grant her the additional title of Empress of India.\\nVictoria was the daughter of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn the fourth son of King George III, and Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. After the deaths of her father and grandfather in 1820, she was raised under close supervision by her mother and her comptroller, John Conroy. She inherited the throne aged 18 after her fathers three elder brothers died without surviving legitimate issue. Victoria, a constitutional monarch, attempted privately to influence government policy and ministerial appointments; publicly, she became a national icon who was identified with strict standards of personal morality.\\nVictoria married her first cousin Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1840. Their children married into royal and noble families across the continent, earning Victoria the sobriquet the grandmother of Europe and spreading haemophilia in European royalty. After Alberts death in 1861, Victoria plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances. As a result of her seclusion, British republicanism temporarily gained strength, but in the latter half of her reign, her popularity recovered.

            "Eugene Young character, Eugene Young is a fictional character played by Steve Harris on the American legal drama, The Practice, created by David E. Kelley. Eugene was one of the original cast members and stayed as a main character until the end of the series, which ran between 1997 and 2004.At the opening of the series, Eugene played an attorney working for Bobby Donnell, and before long was made a partner along with Lindsay Dole and Ellenor Frut, precipitating the firm changing its name to Donnell, Young, Dole, and Frutt. In one of the first episodes, Eugene comments that he has been a lawyer for seven years Trial and Error. He had been the first to join with Bobby, several years prior to the start of the show he may or may not have done so immediately upon his becoming a lawyer. He was a private investigator before that, and his detective skills including some strong arm tactics come up from time to time in his legal career.\\nLike many of the attorneys on the series, Eugenes home life is tumultuouswhile identified as married in the fifth episode, the tenth episode states him as being separated and in all probability that was the case from the onset of the series. Still, in that episode, Dog Bite, he turns down a date from an attractive D.A., though his reason for doing so is because his son is not ready for that. Soon the divorce is finalized and his wife takes custody of their son, who is only about twelve years old at the time. Eugene struggles to be a good father and to keep his son on the straight and narrow. He admits more than once that part of what drives him is that his brother died in prison after being falsely convicted. His dream was always to change the system for the better, and one avenue of how to do that he long thought of was an appointment as a judge.\\nAt some point in his life, Eugene was pulled over and beaten by the police for matching the general description of a wanted suspect. Perhaps as a direct result of that, Eugene especially in the series early seasons had no problem playing the race card to get some of his African American clients off the hook. It also prompted him to get involved with the defense of a police officer who was fired for admitting that he had a racial problem First Degree. The police officer felt that his years on the force had turned him into a racist, and was seeking disability and an early pension. Even though the thought of giving an admitted racist disability benefits was uncomfortable, Eugene felt that there was an opportunity for greater goodit may prompt more police officers to admit when they are having problems with racism. In the course of that proceeding, Eugene did allow his pent up feelings regarding his beat down to seep through, angrily charging that racism is a cancer that must be eradicated where you find it and that it is an epidemic in the police department.\\nLike most of the other members of the firm and ironically Alan Shore, Eugene opposes the death penalty. In one of the final episodes of the series run, when a panel of judges questions his position, he passionately and honestly defends it. New Hoods on the Block\\nEugenes character for the first seven seasons is in many ways intended to be a foil for Bobby Donnell. One of the key elements of the show is the conflict that arises when legal ethics may violate moral ethics. While Bobby constantly struggles with this, Eugene typically remains more stoic, though at times even he admits to feeling empty.\\nA few examples of the above include:\\n\\nWhen Bobby was having an improper affair with one of their clients a woman accused of murder Eugene constantly asserted that Bobbys judgment was impaired. He even stated never fall in love with a client should be the first thing they teach you in law school. When Bobby finally realized he had lost his edge because of his feelings, Eugene had to make an impromptu closing argument in the trial. Reasonable Doubts\\nAfter a young girl gives birth to a still born baby at home unbeknown to anyone, the parents of the mother who is still in high school want to abandon the body for fear that their daughter might be implicated in the childs death. Eugene is distraught when Bobby breaks the law by advising the parents to deliver the baby to the steps of a church he knows of. Bobby admits it has nothing to do with the lawbut his religious beliefs compel him to see that the baby is not merely dumped without a funeral. A Day in the LifeHowever, as stated, sometimes Eugenes strict by-the-book approach gets the better of him.\\n\\nEugene is assigned to defend a young black man with a criminal record who is accused of armed robbery. Eugene is not interested in whether or not the young man is really guilty, as he has no intention of having him testify. While Eugene successfully gets him off, the young man is angered that Eugene did not believe he was telling the truth. Rather than feel elated at winning the case, Eugene ends up at a bar reflecting how cynical the practice of law can leave attorneys from time to time.When Bobby leaves the firm, Eugene becomes the senior partner, with Jimmy Berluti being elevated to full partner. Against his better judgment he allows Eleanor Frutt to hire Alan Shore, an unscrupulous lawyer who consistently butts heads with both Eugene and Jimmy. After continuous unethical and even illegal behavior by Shore, in addition to the conflicts with the firm, Eugene makes the decision with Jimmy but not Eleanor to fire Shore, giving him a small severance package. Shore sues the firm on the basis of wrongful termination, as he had over the previous eight months brought in substantially more money for the firm than all the other partners combined. Shore wins the case, which directly causes a breakdown at the firm.\\nAt that time, Jimmy decides to quit the firm, and Eugene has a meeting with a lawyer at a top firm, though he has no interest in joining. The meeting was, in fact, merely a pretense for the lawyer to conduct an interview with Eugene, as he has been recommended to be appointed as a Superior Court Judge. After a hearing before a review panel where Eugene is grilled over various topics including the death penalty where Eugene stands his ground and Bobby appears to speak on his behalf, Eugene is appointed to the bench. At first, his decision to accept upset Eleanor, as she feels he is abandoning the firm, just like all the others, but soon accepts his decision. Eugenes first case as a judge was about a wheelchair-using woman charging her employer with sex offences. However, he left the case when he saw Alan Shore representing the defendant. Eugene thought that Alan had judge-shopped when actually Alan was only assigned the case on the hearing day being a friend of Denny Crane, the defendant hesitated before going to Crane, Poole & Schmidt for help. To resolve their issues, Alan tells Eugene that his respect for him exceeds that of the respect he is required to give any other judge."

Among his best-known works are the orchestral compositions Rhapsody in Blue 1924 and An American in Paris 1928, the songs Swanee 1919 and Fascinating Rhythm 1924, the jazz standards Embraceable You 1928 and I Got Rhythm 1930, and the opera Porgy and Bess 1935, which included the hit Summertime.\\nGershwin studied piano under Charles Hambitzer and composition with Rubin Goldmark, Henry Cowell, and Joseph Brody. He began his career as a song plugger but soon started composing Broadway theater works with his brother Ira Gershwin and with Buddy DeSylva. He moved to Paris, intending to study with Nadia Boulanger, but she refused him, afraid that rigorous classical study would ruin his jazz-influenced style; Maurice Ravel voiced similar objections when Gershwin inquired about studying with him. He subsequently composed An American in Paris, returned to New York City and wrote Porgy and Bess with Ira and DuBose Heyward. Initially a commercial failure, it came to be considered one of the most important American operas of the twentieth century and an American cultural classic.\\nGershwin moved to Hollywood and composed numerous film scores. He died in 1937 of a brain tumor.His compositions have been adapted for use in film and television, with many becoming jazz standards."

            "World War II, World War II or the Second World War, often abbreviated as WWII or WW2, was a world war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. It involved the vast majority of the worlds countriesincluding all of the great powersforming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers. World War II was a total war that directly involved more than 100 million personnel from more than 30 countries.\\nThe major participants in the war threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role in the conflict, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and deploying the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war.\\nWorld War II was by far the deadliest conflict in human history; it resulted in 70 to 85 million fatalities, mostly among civilians. Tens of millions died due to genocides including the Holocaust, starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of the Axis defeat, Germany and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.\\nThe causes of World War II are debated, but contributing factors included the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, Spanish Civil War, Second Sino-Japanese War, SovietJapanese border conflicts, rise of fascism in Europe and rising European tensions since World War I. World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. The United Kingdom and France subsequently declared war on Germany on 3 September. Under the MolotovRibbentrop Pact of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union had partitioned Poland and marked out their spheres of influence across Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan with other countries later. Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa, and the fall of France in mid-1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire, with war in the Balkans, the aerial Battle of Britain, the Blitz of the United Kingdom, and the Battle of the Atlantic. On 22 June 1941, Germany led the European Axis powers in an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the Eastern Front, the largest land theatre of war in history.\\nJapan, which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific, was at war with the Republic of China by 1937. In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific, including an attack on the US fleet at Pearl Harbor which resulted in the United States declaring war against Japan. The European Axis powers declared war on the United States in solidarity. Japan soon captured much of the western Pacific, but its advances were halted in 1942 after losing the critical Battle of Midway; later, Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943including a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasions of Sicily and the Italian mainland, and Allied offensives in the Pacificcost the Axis powers their initiative and forced them into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France, while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and turned towards Germany and its allies. During 1944 and 1945, Japan suffered reversals in mainland Asia, while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and captured key western Pacific islands.\\nThe war in Europe concluded with the liberation of German-occupied territories and the invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the Fall of Berlin to Soviet troops, Hitlers suicide, and the German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. Following the refusal of Japan to surrender on the terms of the Potsdam Declaration issued 26 July 1945, the United States dropped the first atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima on 6 August and Nagasaki on 9 August. Faced with an imminent invasion of the Japanese archipelago, the possibility of additional atomic bombings, and the Soviet Unions declared entry into the war against Japan on the eve of invading Manchuria, Japan announced on 10 August its intention to surrender, signing a surrender document on 2 September 1945.\\nWorld War II changed the political alignment and social structure of the globe. The United Nations was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts, with the victorious great powersChina, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United Statesbecoming the permanent members of its Security Council. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the nearly half-century-long Cold War. In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonisation of Africa and Asia. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion. Political and economic integration, especially in Europe, began as an effort to forestall future hostilities, end pre-war enmities and forge a sense of common identity."

The one exception to the rule was Santa Claus, a character whom Forbes decided to be an irresistible addition, although he has been absent from the list since 2006. Forbes stated, We still estimate Clauss net worth as infinite, but we excluded him from this years rankings after being bombarded by letters from outraged children insisting that Claus is real. We dont claim to have settled the ongoing controversy concerning Clauss existence, but after taking into account the physical evidencetoys delivered, milk and cookies devouredwe felt it was safer to remove him from consideration. After Claus was excluded, Scrooge McDuck became the wealthiest member due to being portrayed as having a tower vault full of gold. Carol Miller or Mom from Futurama is the wealthiest woman on the list, with an estimated $15.7 billion.\\nThe wealth of fictional characters under consideration for the list is calculated by combining the fictional source texts with real-world information about stock and commodity prices.

He was among the most influential figures in jazz. His career spanned five decades and several eras in the history of jazz.Armstrong was born and raised in New Orleans. Coming to prominence in the 1920s as an inventive trumpet and cornet player, Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz, shifting the focus of the music from collective improvisation to solo performance. Around 1922, he followed his mentor, Joe King Oliver, to Chicago to play in the Creole Jazz Band. In Chicago, he spent time with other popular jazz musicians, reconnecting with his friend Bix Beiderbecke and spending time with Hoagy Carmichael and Lil Hardin. He earned a reputation at cutting contests, and his fame reached band leader Fletcher Henderson. Henderson persuaded Armstrong to come to New York City, where he became a featured and musically influential band soloist and recording artist. Hardin became Armstrongs second wife and they returned to Chicago to play together and then he began to form his own Hot jazz bands. After years of touring, he settled in Queens, New York, and by the 1950s, he was a national musical icon, assisted in part, by his appearances on radio and in film and television, in addition to his concerts.\\nWith his instantly recognizable rich, gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer and skillful improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song. He was also skilled at scat singing. Armstrong is renowned for his charismatic stage presence and voice as well as his trumpet playing. By the end of Armstrongs life, his influence had spread to popular music in general. Armstrong was one of the first popular African-American entertainers to cross over to wide popularity with white and international audiences. He rarely publicly politicized his race, to the dismay of fellow African Americans, but took a well-publicized stand for desegregation in the Little Rock crisis. He was able to access the upper echelons of American society at a time when this was difficult for black men.\\nArmstrong appeared in films such as High Society 1956 alongside Bing Crosby, Grace Kelly, and Frank Sinatra, and Hello, Dolly! 1969 starring Barbra Streisand. He received many accolades including three Grammy Award nominations and a win for his vocal performance of Hello, Dolly! in 1964. In 2017, he was posthumously inducted into the Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame."

Frank Baums 1900 childrens fantasy novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the film was primarily directed by Victor Fleming who left the production to take over the troubled Gone with the Wind, and stars Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley, Billie Burke and Margaret Hamilton. Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson, and Edgar Allan Woolf received credit for the screenplay, but others made uncredited contributions. The music was composed by Harold Arlen and adapted by Herbert Stothart, with the lyrics written by Edgar Yip Harburg.\\nCharacterized by its use of Technicolor, fantasy storytelling, musical score, and memorable characters, The Wizard of Oz was moderately successful upon its original release of August 25, 1939. The film was considered a critical success and was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, winning in two categories: Best Original Song for Over the Rainbow and Best Original Score by Stothart. While the film was sufficiently popular at the box office, it failed to make a profit for MGM until the 1949 re-release, earning only $3,017,000 on a $2,777,000 budget, not including promotional costs, which made it MGMs most expensive production at that time.The 1956 television broadcast premiere of the film on the CBS network reintroduced the film to the public; according to the U.S. Library of Congress, it is the most seen film in movie history. In 1989, it was selected by the Library of Congress as one of the first 25 films for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant. It is also one of the few films on UNESCOs Memory of the World Register. The film was ranked second in Varietys inaugural 100 Greatest Movies of All Time list published in 2022. It was among the top ten in the 2005 BFI British Film Institute list of 50 films to be seen by the age of 14, and is on the BFIs updated list of 50 films to be seen by the age of 15 released in May 2020.The Wizard of Oz has become the source of many quotes referenced in contemporary popular culture. The film ranks often on critics lists of greatest films of all time, and is the most commercially successful adaptation of L. Frank Baums work."

To jam is to improvise music without extensive preparation or predefined arrangements, except for when the group is playing well-known jazz standards or covers of existing popular songs. Original jam sessions, also called free flow sessions, are often used by musicians to develop new material music and find suitable arrangements. Both styles can be used simply as a social gathering and communal practice session. Jam sessions may be based upon existing songs or forms, may be loosely based on an agreed chord progression or chart suggested by one participant, or may be wholly improvisational. Jam sessions can range from very loose gatherings of amateurs to evenings where a jam session coordinator or host acts as a gatekeeper so that appropriate-level performers take the stage to sophisticated improvised recording sessions by professionals which are intended to be broadcast live on radio or TV or edited and released to the public."

Nicknamed Iron Mike and Kid Dynamite in his early career, and later known as The Baddest Man on the Planet, Tyson is considered to be one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time. He reigned as the undisputed world heavyweight champion from 1987 to 1990. Tyson won his first 19 professional fights by knockout, 12 of them in the first round. Claiming his first belt at 20 years, four months, and 22 days old, Tyson holds the record as the youngest boxer ever to win a heavyweight title. He was the first heavyweight boxer to simultaneously hold the WBA, WBC and IBF titles, as well as the only heavyweight to unify them in succession. The following year, Tyson became the lineal champion when he knocked out Michael Spinks in 91 seconds of the first round. In 1990, Tyson was knocked out by underdog Buster Douglas in one of the biggest upsets in history.\\nIn 1992, Tyson was convicted of rape and sentenced to six years in prison, although he was released on parole after three years. After his release in 1995, he engaged in a series of comeback fights, regaining the WBA and WBC titles in 1996 to join Floyd Patterson, Muhammad Ali, Tim Witherspoon, Evander Holyfield and George Foreman as the only men in boxing history to have regained a heavyweight championship after losing it. After being stripped of the WBC title in the same year, Tyson lost the WBA title to Evander Holyfield by an eleventh round stoppage. Their 1997 rematch ended when Tyson was disqualified for biting Holyfields ears, one bite notoriously being strong enough to remove a portion of his right ear. In 2002, Tyson fought for the world heavyweight title, losing by knockout to Lennox Lewis.\\nTyson was known for his ferocious and intimidating boxing style as well as his controversial behavior inside and outside the ring. With a knockout-to-win percentage of 88%, he was ranked 16th on The Ring magazines list of 100 greatest punchers of all time, and first on ESPNs list of The Hardest Hitters in Heavyweight History. Sky Sports described him as perhaps the most ferocious fighter to step into a professional ring. He has been inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame and the World Boxing Hall of Fame."

Earth-based mechanic Tadashi and his girlfriend discover a mech from a war eight years past with an ominous message stored in its memory suggesting Earth is in danger. Tadashi decides to venture to nearby space colonies along with Elina and his younger sister Azusa to investigate the origins of the mech. As Tadashi, the player speaks with other characters and picks dialogue and action commands to advance the narrative.\\nDevelopment was led by artist Yoshimiru Hoshi, who was contracted to develop the game after Satoru Iwata, who produced the game, was impressed by his character graphics. Yoshimiru wrote the script and was responsible for the game artwork. Although the Famicom had limited graphical capabilities and relied on the use of tilesets for artwork, he used advanced graphical techniques so his pixel art mirrored his manga-style pencil work. The detail placed on the graphics extended the games development for four years.\\nThe long development time and advanced graphics made Metal Slader Glory the largest Famicom game and one of the costliest to develop. It required a special chip which made the carts expensive to produce. Nintendo only sold enough chips to HAL so they could produce one run. The game was met with mixed reviews, and although the first run sold out, it did not cover the games advertising budget. The game placed a large financial strain on HAL Laboratory. As the company drove towards bankruptcy, they ceased independently publishing console games and entered a close affiliation with Nintendo.\\nYoshimiru considers Metal Slader Glory his life work. He has continued to explore the universe through manga and other works. A remake for the Super Famicom was released in 2000 on Nintendo Power flash cartridges, and was the last game released for the system. Both the original and remake were later released on the Virtual Console in Japan. A fan translation was released in 2018."

The two Guardians balance out the forces in the universe, although the Black Guardian seems to desire to upset the balance in favour of chaos and evil while the White Guardian prefers to maintain the status quo. The Guardians both appeared in Season 16 of the programme, where all six serials of that season were linked together in the quest for the Key to Time, an artifact of immense power that would give the wielder supreme power over all existence.\\nThe White Guardian had concerns that the universe was descending into chaos. As a result, he asked the Doctor to find and assemble the Key to Time so that he might restore the balance of the universe. The Doctor was successful in this task, but the Black Guardian disguised himself as the White and tried to deceive the Doctor into handing the key over to him instead. The Doctor saw through the Black Guardians ruse - due to the Guardians lack of concern for Astra of Atrios, who was literally the sixth segment; the White Guardian would never have been so callous about the fate of a sentient being - and ordered the key to disperse, though he commented afterwards that the White Guardian should have been able to carry out his work while the key was assembled.\\nThe Guardian next appeared briefly during Enlightenment, the conclusion of the Black Guardian Trilogy, a story arc in which the evil Guardian attempted to force Turlough to kill the Doctor.

            "The Long Count Fight, The Long Count Fight, or the Battle of the Long Count, was a professional boxing 10-round rematch between world heavyweight champion Gene Tunney and former champion Jack Dempsey, which Tunney won in a unanimous decision. It took place on September 22, 1927, at Soldier Field in Chicago. Long Count is applied to the fight because when Tunney was knocked down in the seventh round the count was delayed due to Dempseys failure to go to and remain in a neutral corner. Whether this long count actually affected the outcome remains a subject of debate.\\nJust 364 days before, on September 23, 1926, Tunney had beaten Dempsey by a ten round unanimous decision to lift the world heavyweight title, at Sesquicentennial Stadium in Philadelphia. The first fight between Tunney and Dempsey had been moved out of Chicago because Dempsey had learned that Al Capone was a big fan of his, and he did not want Capone to be involved in the fight. Capone reportedly bet $50,000 on Dempsey for the rematch, which fueled false rumors of a fix. Dempsey was favored by odds makers in both fights, largely because of public betting which heavily tilted towards Dempsey.\\nThe rematch was held at Chicagos Soldier Field, and would draw a gate of $2,658,660 equivalent to $41,474,000 in 2021. It was the first $2 million gate in entertainment history.\\nDespite the fact that Tunney had won the first fight by a wide margin on the scorecards, the prospect of a second bout created tremendous public interest. Dempsey was one of the so-called big five sports legends of the 1920s, and it was widely rumored that he had refused to participate in the military during World War I. He actually had attempted to enlist in the Army, but had been turned down; a jury later exonerated Dempsey of draft evasion. Tunney, who enjoyed literature and the arts, was a former member of the United States Marine Corps. His nickname was The Fighting Marine.\\nThe fight took place under new rules regarding knockdowns: the fallen fighter would have 10 seconds to rise to his feet under his own power, after his opponent moved to a neutral corner i.e., one with no trainers. The new rule, which was not yet universal, was asked to be put into use during the fight by the Dempsey camp, who had requested it during negotiations. Dempsey, in the final days of training prior to the rematch, apparently ignored the setting of these new rules. Also, the fight was staged inside a 20-foot ring, which favored the boxer with superior footwork, in this case Tunney. Dempsey liked to crowd his opponents, and normally fought in a 16-foot ring that offered less space to maneuver."

Born Baron Wallis, he is a member of The Boys, a group of CIA-sponsored vigilantes led by William Billy Butcher who observe, record, and sometimes liquidate Supes i.e. superpowered or superhuman individuals, often acting as superheroes artificially created by the mega-conglomerate Vought. One of two Supes in the group alongside The Female of the Species, Wallis mother was dosed with the superpower-inducing Compound V while pregnant with him, the result of which was her eventually mutating into a Cthulhu-like creature, and him and later his daughter Janine becoming the first naturally-born Supe, prematurely aging appearing to be in his 40s when in fact in his 20s. To stay alive, Mothers Milk requires continued consumption of his mothers Compound V-enhancing mothers milk on a semi-regular basis, leading to him taking the term as a sobriquet and boxing ring name. He later rises to become heavyweight champion of the world following his military career, before being recruited to the Boys after accidentally killing his opponent in the ring, becoming Butchers second-in-command/best friend over years of missions and befriending Hugh Wee Hughie Campbell on his own recruitment. After helping Butcher finally get his revenge on Black Noir, M.M. learns that Butcher plans on killing all Supes and potential Supes i.e. every person ever exposed to Compound V, including him and his daughter. After confronting Butcher over this and for having already killed Frenchie, the Female, and M.Ms abusive ex-wife, M.M. is smothered to death by Butcher to prevent him from interfering with his plan. In order to avenge her son, M.M.s mother then gives Hughie the necessary milk to kill Butcher.\\nThe character is primarily portrayed by Laz Alonso in the Amazon Prime Video streaming adaptation while Elias Leon Leacock portrays a young Marvin in the third season. Unlike the comic series, Marvin T. Mothers Milk, primarily known as MM, is depicted as a regular human though still a military veteran with a dislike of Vought and its Supes resulting from a car crash caused by Soldier Boy in MMs youth, which killed his mother, uncle, and grandfather, and led to his father working himself to death as a lawyer unsuccessfully attempting to sue Vought. In the present storyline, MM joins Butcher and the reformed Boys in exposing the existence of Compound V and taking down Stormfront in the first and second seasons, while in the third season, set two years later, a now-divorced MM rejoins the Boys as they attempt to take down Victoria Neuman and the Homelander, coming to odds with Butcher over his use of V-24 and partnership with a still-alive Soldier Boy Homelanders father. Mothers Milks lactophiliac tendencies from the comic series are additionally instead adapted to Homelander portrayed by Antony Starr in the television series, while his status as the first naturally-born Supe is adapted to Ryan Butcher portrayed by Cameron Crovetti. The character has received a positive critical reception."
